Sega is a Japanese video game developer and publisher headquartered in Shinagawa, Tokyo. It was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart on June ;3, 1960; shortly after, the company acquired the assets of its predecessor, Service Games of Japan. Sega developed its first coin-operated game, Periscope, in the late 1960s. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega developed video game consoles, starting with the SG-1000 and Master System, but struggled against competitors such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. Sega released its next console, the Sega Genesis, in 1988; it found success outside Japan starting with Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. In 2001, Sega stopped making consoles to become a third-party developer and publisher, and was acquired by Sammy Corporation in 2004. Sega produces multi-million-selling game franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Total War, and Yakuza, and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. (Full ;article...)
June 3: Feast day of Saint Charles Lwanga and the Uganda Martyrs (Catholicism, Anglicanism, Lutheranism)
Anna Palm de Rosa (1859–1924) was a Swedish artist and landscape painter. In the 1890s, she was one of Sweden's most popular painters, with her watercolours of steamers, sailing ships and scenes of Stockholm, but she left Sweden for good at the age of 36, marrying an Italian and spending the rest of her life in southern Italy.
This painting, dated 1885, shows a game of ombre at Brøndums Hotel, in Skagen in the north of Denmark. The hotel is remembered for its close associations with the late 19th-century artists' colony known as the Skagen Painters. In order to help cover their board and lodgings, some of the artists donated their work to the hotel, where the pictures were displayed on the walls of the dining room. This painting is now in the collection of Skagens Museum.
Wikipedia is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other projects:

Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/&#32;(listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə/&#32;(listen) wik-ee-PEE-dee-ə) (abbreviated as WP) is a multilingual online encyclopedia. The website was created and is maintained as an open collaboration project&#91;4&#93; by a community of volunteer editors, using a wiki-based editing system.&#91;5&#93; It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; It is also one of the 20 most popular websites ranked by Alexa, as of March ;2020&#91;update&#93;.&#91;9&#93; It features exclusively free content and no commercial ads and is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93;&#91;13&#93;
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, and was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.&#91;14&#93; Sanger coined its name&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; as a portmanteau of the words "wiki" (Hawaiian for "quick")&#91;17&#93; and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With 6.1 ;million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 53 ;million articles&#91;18&#93; attracting 1.5 ;billion unique visitors per month.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93;
In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica,&#91;21&#93; although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.&#91;24&#93;
Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of "truth, half truth, and some falsehoods",&#91;25&#93; and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.&#91;26&#93; Wikipedia has also been criticized for gender bias, particularly on its English-language version, where the dominant majority of editors are male. However, edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; Facebook announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.&#91;29&#93;
Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful.&#91;30&#93; Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.&#91;31&#93; It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93; Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.&#91;34&#93; Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.&#91;37&#93; On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.&#91;38&#93;
The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001&#91;39&#93; and January 13, 2001&#91;40&#93; respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,&#91;31&#93; as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,&#91;41&#93; and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.&#91;35&#93; Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"&#91;42&#93; was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.&#91;35&#93; Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.&#91;43&#93;
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004.&#91;44&#93; Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for almost 600 ;years.&#91;45&#93;
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.&#91;46&#93; These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.&#91;47&#93; Brion Vibber applied the change on August 15, 2002.&#91;48&#93;
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93; The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.&#91;57&#93; Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.&#91;58&#93; Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable".&#91;59&#93; A 2013 article titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" in MIT's Technology Review questioned this claim. The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae.&#91;60&#93; In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline.&#91;61&#93; In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis".&#91;62&#93;
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.&#91;67&#93; More than 162 ;million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.&#91;68&#93;&#91;69&#93;
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it "had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent."&#91;70&#93; Varma added that, "While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users."&#91;70&#93; When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, "If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further]."&#91;70&#93; By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally.&#91;71&#93;
In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument; and, in July 2015, Wikipedia became available as 7,473 books for $500,000. In 2019, a species of flowering plant was named Viola wikipedia.&#91;72&#93; In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93; In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 ;GB of article text from the English Wikipedia have been encoded into synthetic DNA.&#91;75&#93;
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle&#91;note 3&#93;&#91;78&#93; regarding the security of its content.&#91;78&#93; It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.
Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.&#91;79&#93; On the English Wikipedia, among others, some particularly controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to some degree.&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93; A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.&#91;82&#93; A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.&#91;83&#93;
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of articles,&#91;84&#93; which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the "pending changes" system in December 2012.&#91;85&#93; Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.&#91;86&#93;
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. The "History" page of each article links to each revision.&#91;note 4&#93;&#91;87&#93; On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a "watchlist" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. "New pages patrol" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.&#91;88&#93;
In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor "creative construction" over "creative destruction".&#91;89&#93;
Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.&#91;90&#93; Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.&#91;91&#93;
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93; However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.&#91;94&#93;
In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.&#91;94&#93; The article remained uncorrected for four months.&#91;94&#93; Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93; After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as "a flawed and irresponsible research tool".&#91;94&#93; This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.&#91;97&#93;
Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as "edit warring".&#91;98&#93;&#91;99&#93; The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.&#91;100&#93; This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,&#91;101&#93; conflict based&#91;102&#93; editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,&#91;103&#93; which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.
Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests. Defending Israeli settlements in the West Bank, numerous pro-occupation groups have launched "Zionist editing" campaigns.&#91;104&#93; In 2010, the then-director general of the Yesha Council and former Israeli Cabinet Minister Naftali Bennett described their goal "as not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view".&#91;105&#93;

Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the "five pillars" and in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.&#91;106&#93; Editors can enforce these rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.&#91;84&#93;
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.&#91;107&#93; A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability",&#91;108&#93; which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.&#91;109&#93; It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.&#91;110&#93; This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.&#91;111&#93; Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.&#91;112&#93; All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article. This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.&#91;113&#93;&#91;114&#93; An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.&#91;115&#93;
Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with "administrator",&#91;116&#93;&#91;117&#93; privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing. Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).&#91;118&#93;&#91;119&#93;
Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.&#91;120&#93;
Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.
Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,&#91;note 5&#93; or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a "request for comment".
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,&#91;121&#93; functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.&#91;122&#93;
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated "Talk" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.&#91;123&#93;
Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,&#91;124&#93; although not always with entirely negative connotations.&#91;125&#93; The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as "anti-elitism".&#91;126&#93;
Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work.&#91;127&#93;
The English Wikipedia has 6,091,755 articles, 39,187,130 registered editors, and 145,069 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.
Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references".&#91;133&#93; Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,&#91;133&#93; as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation",&#91;134&#93; but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site".&#91;135&#93; Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that "[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users ;... 524 people ;... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits."&#91;130&#93; However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders", while most editing and formatting is done by "insiders".&#91;130&#93;
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,&#91;136&#93;&#91;137&#93; although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.&#91;138&#93; According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content".&#91;139&#93;
Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.&#91;140&#93; Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.&#91;141&#93; Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to "ugly, intimidating behavior".&#91;142&#93; Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.&#91;143&#93;
There are currently 310 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of June 2020, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, Swedish, German, French, and Dutch Wikipedias.&#91;144&#93; The second and third largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013 had created about half the articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
In addition to the top six, eleven other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Waray, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Portuguese and Ukrainian), six more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Serbian, Egyptian Arabic, Norwegian Bokmål and Indonesian), 43 more have over 100,000, and 83 more have over 10,000.&#91;145&#93;&#91;146&#93; The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6 million articles. As of January ;2019&#91;update&#93;, according to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 57% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Russian: 9%; Chinese: 6%; Japanese: 6%; Spanish: 5%).&#91;9&#93;
Distribution of the 53,561,048 articles in different language editions (as of June 3, 2020)&#91;147&#93;
The unit for the numbers in bars is articles.
Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)&#91;149&#93; or points of view.&#91;150&#93;
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.&#91;151&#93;&#91;152&#93;&#91;153&#93;
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language".&#91;154&#93; Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).&#91;155&#93; For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,&#91;156&#93; and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.&#91;157&#93; The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles.&#91;158&#93; Articles available in more than one language may offer "interwiki links", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.
A study published by PLoS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia.&#91;159&#93;
On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled "The Future of Wikipedia", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by Wikimedia stating that "[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years."&#91;160&#93; The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.
Should this attrition have continued unabated at the quoted trend rate of approximately 20,000 editors lost within a seven-year stretch, by 2021 there would be only 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia.&#91;160&#93; In contrast, the trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.&#91;160&#93; No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.&#91;161&#93;
Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014&#91;update&#93;.&#91;162&#93;&#91;163&#93;
Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of "truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods".&#91;25&#93; Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.&#91;164&#93;&#91;165&#93;&#91;166&#93;
Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an "ax to grind" on the topic.&#91;25&#93;&#91;167&#93; A 2008 article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.&#91;26&#93;
In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the English Wikipedia.&#91;168&#93;
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.&#91;169&#93; However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that "the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three."&#91;21&#93; Reagle suggested that while the study reflects "a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors" in science articles, "Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects."&#91;22&#93; Others raised similar critiques.&#91;23&#93; The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica,&#91;170&#93;&#91;171&#93; and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.&#91;172&#93; In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a "flawed study design" (in Nature&#39;s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study "statistical power" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 ;× 101 articles compared, vs &gt;105 and &gt;106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).&#91;173&#93;
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of validity" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.&#91;174&#93; Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity,&#91;175&#93; the insertion of false information,&#91;176&#93; vandalism, and similar problems.
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.&#91;177&#93;
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.&#91;178&#93; Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.&#91;179&#93; Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.&#91;180&#93; Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of "fake news" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.&#91;181&#93;
A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general source" that "can be a real boon" in "coming up to speed in the law governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources".&#91;190&#93;
Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;&#91;191&#93; some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.&#91;192&#93;&#91;193&#93; Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.&#91;194&#93; Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia," he said.&#91;195&#93;
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.&#91;196&#93; In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google,&#91;197&#93; stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything".
In contrast, academic writing in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process.&#91;198&#93; Some academics suggest ‘Verifiability by respected sources’ as an indicator for assessing the quality of Wikipedia articles at the higher education level.&#91;199&#93;

On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled "Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia", stated that "Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information."&#91;200&#93; Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.&#91;200&#93; In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: "Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference."&#91;201&#93; Beck added that: "Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed."&#91;201&#93;
In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination.&#91;203&#93; For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig, a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its "clear and engaging prose", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing.&#91;204&#93; Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised "McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words." By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds "both verbose and dull". Rosenzweig also criticized the "waffling—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history". While generally praising the article on William Clarke Quantrill, he quoted its conclusion as an example of such "waffling", which then stated: "Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero."&#91;204&#93;
Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented, "Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 percent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage."&#91;205&#93; A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University. The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the "start" class or "stub" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that "Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing".&#91;206&#93; The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: "inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information".&#91;207&#93;
To assess Wikipedia articles various quality measures related to credibility, completeness, objectivity, readability, relevance, style and timeliness can be used.&#91;208&#93;
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.&#91;209&#93; The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).&#91;210&#93;&#91;211&#93; Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The 'Wikipedia is not censored' policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China&#91;212&#93; and Pakistan,&#91;213&#93; amongst other countries.
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:&#91;214&#93;
These numbers refer only to the quantity of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its "Wikipedia Loves Libraries" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.&#91;215&#93;
A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males focus more on Geography and Science.&#91;216&#93;
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is most underrepresented.&#91;217&#93; Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.&#91;218&#93;
An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.&#91;219&#93; Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.&#91;143&#93;
When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, systemic bias may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example "biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare".&#91;59&#93; The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.&#91;60&#93;
Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally,&#91;vague&#93; for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions.&#91;220&#93; It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture, inclining to being young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may include over-emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events.&#91;220&#93;
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford, in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.&#91;221&#93;&#91;222&#93; His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs". Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually reverting edit pairs". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism, and Muhammad.&#91;222&#93; By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.&#91;222&#93;
Researchers from Washington University developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact.&#91;223&#93;&#91;224&#93;
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content. Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as Feces, Cadaver, Human penis, Vulva, and Nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.
The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a "blacklist" it supplies to British internet service providers.&#91;225&#93;
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.&#91;226&#93;&#91;227&#93; Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.&#91;228&#93; That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.&#91;228&#93; Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.&#91;229&#93; Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,&#91;230&#93; saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it."&#91;230&#93; Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted".&#91;231&#93; Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.&#91;232&#93;
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a "private citizen" rather than a "public figure" in the eyes of the law.&#91;233&#93;&#91;note 6&#93; It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life ("meatspace"). A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka "Tron", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.&#91;234&#93;
Wikipedia has a "Volunteer Response Team" that uses the OTRS system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.&#91;235&#93;
Wikipedia has been described as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.&#91;236&#93;&#91;237&#93; The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap in Wikipedia editors.&#91;238&#93; In 2014, a female editor who requested a separate space on Wikipedia to discuss improving civility had her proposal referred to by a male editor using the words "the easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like one".&#91;236&#93;
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks. The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.&#91;239&#93; The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7 ;million and expenses of almost $29 ;million, with assets of $37.2 ;million and liabilities of about $2.3 ;million.&#91;240&#93;
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.&#91;241&#93; The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, "Information, like air, wants to be free."&#91;242&#93;&#91;243&#93; The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who "said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ;... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities," Walsh said.&#91;242&#93;
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the "superprotection" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.&#91;244&#93; Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: "It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ;... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words."&#91;245&#93;
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.&#91;246&#93; The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed&#91;247&#93; to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.
In April 2005, a Lucene extension&#91;248&#93;&#91;249&#93; was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1,&#91;250&#93;&#91;needs update&#93; which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3.&#91;251&#93;
In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.&#91;252&#93;&#91;253&#93;&#91;254&#93;&#91;255&#93; It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and buggy".&#91;256&#93; The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.
Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.&#91;257&#93;&#91;258&#93;&#91;259&#93; One controversial contributor creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.&#91;260&#93; Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).&#91;261&#93; Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.&#91;258&#93; Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.&#91;262&#93; Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.&#91;263&#93;
According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.&#91;264&#93;
Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.&#91;265&#93;&#91;needs update&#93; As of 2019&#91;update&#93;, page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers.&#91;266&#93; Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available.&#91;267&#93; Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu).&#91;268&#93;&#91;269&#93; As of December ;2009&#91;update&#93;, there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.&#91;270&#93; By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.&#91;271&#93;&#91;272&#93; in 2017, Wikipedia had installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.&#91;273&#93;
In accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported,&#91;60&#93; the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.&#91;274&#93; Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized "Thank" tab which were developed for the purpose of ameliorating issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success.&#91;60&#93;&#91;256&#93; The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.&#91;275&#93; At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 ;million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 ;million and 11.3 ;million dollars annually.&#91;275&#93; In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by Bloomberg News as being at $77 ;million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 ;million and $19.2 ;million annually.&#91;275&#93;
Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia's The Signpost, founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees.&#91;276&#93; It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikimedia Commons. Similar publications are the German-language Kurier, and the Portuguese-language Correio da Wikipédia. Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the Wikiworld webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This Month in Education.
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.&#91;277&#93; The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.&#91;278&#93; Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.&#91;279&#93;&#91;280&#93;&#91;281&#93;&#91;282&#93;
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.&#91;283&#93;
The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court.&#91;284&#93;&#91;285&#93;
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.&#91;296&#93; Wikipedia publishes "dumps" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007&#91;update&#93; there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images.&#91;297&#93;
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.&#91;298&#93;
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.&#91;19&#93; The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."&#91;19&#93; The New York Times reports that Möller has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the "worry" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.&#91;19&#93;
Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.&#91;299&#93; At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue.&#91;243&#93; The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.&#91;300&#93; The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.&#91;301&#93;
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,&#91;302&#93; located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices or WebOS-based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See Wikipedia:Metadata), such as geoinformation.&#91;303&#93;&#91;304&#93;
Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries.&#91;305&#93; It was discontinued in February 2018.&#91;306&#93;
Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.&#91;60&#93; Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.&#91;307&#93;&#91;308&#93;
In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, "YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'."&#91;29&#93; In answer to the question of 'how engaged are visitors to the site?' Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.04 and the daily time on site as 4.01 minutes.&#91;9&#93;
In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia is ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating "With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month [...] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors."&#91;19&#93;
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,&#91;309&#93; Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.&#91;310&#93; About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,&#91;311&#93; a good portion of which is related to academic research.&#91;312&#93; The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 ;million at the end of 2009.&#91;313&#93; The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.&#91;314&#93; In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 ;billion if it ran advertisements.&#91;315&#93;
According to "Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.&#91;316&#93;
During the 2019-20 coronovirus pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.&#91;317&#93; The page has remained popular.&#91;318&#93;
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.&#91;319&#93;&#91;320&#93;&#91;321&#93; The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the Civil Marriage Act.&#91;322&#93; The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization&#91;323&#93;—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.&#91;324&#93; Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.&#91;325&#93; In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.&#91;326&#93;
Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,&#91;327&#93;&#91;328&#93; often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.&#91;329&#93;&#91;330&#93;&#91;331&#93;
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook)&#91;332&#93; in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.
In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4&#91;333&#93; which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar (Google, Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation.
On September 28, 2007, Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.&#91;334&#93;
On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: "Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day."&#91;335&#93; An October 2007 Reuters article, titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.&#91;336&#93;
Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience.&#91;337&#93;
A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia "the best-known example of crowdsourcing ;... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth."&#91;338&#93;
In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as "one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having "since colonized the web for television's values". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers "endangered" due to the "gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment." Rather than "sapere aude" (lit.&#8201;''dare to know''), social networks have led to a culture of "[d]are not to care to know". This is while Wikipedia faces "a more concerning problem" than funding, namely "a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to "save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know."&#91;339&#93;
Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004.&#91;340&#93; The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community" category.&#91;341&#93; Wikipedia was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby award.
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?"&#91;342&#93;
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.&#91;343&#93;
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,&#91;344&#93; and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation.&#91;345&#93; Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian language Wikipedia users.&#91;346&#93; The night of the ceremony, members of the Wikimedia Foundation held a meeting with Wikipedians from all parts of Spain, including the local Asturian community.
Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on".&#91;189&#93; Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,&#91;347&#93; as well as the 2010 The Onion article "'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today".&#91;348&#93;
In an episode of the television comedy The Office U.S., which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.&#91;349&#93; Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.&#91;350&#93;
"My Number One Doctor", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Dr. Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.&#91;351&#93;
In 2008, the comedic website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.&#91;352&#93;
The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying "Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia."&#91;353&#93;
In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.&#91;354&#93;
In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0, to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing.&#91;355&#93;&#91;356&#93;
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: "Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?"&#91;357&#93; The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier and a trans woman.
In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia "at least a dozen times a day", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as "a work of reference as useful as any in existence", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place or thing that it has left uncovered, and that he could never have written his last two books without it.&#91;358&#93;&#91;359&#93;
Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,&#91;360&#93; Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for citizen journalism, and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.&#91;361&#93; Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalogue of species. In 2012 Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide, and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.&#91;362&#93;&#91;363&#93;&#91;364&#93; Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, "The amorality of Web 2.0", that criticized websites with user-generated content, like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the time". Carr wrote: "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening."&#91;365&#93; Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, wrote in Nature that the "wisdom of crowds" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals, with their rigorous peer review process.&#91;366&#93;
There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. "The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?" said Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian.&#91;367&#93;
Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification",&#91;368&#93; and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation.&#91;369&#93; Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.&#91;370&#93;
In 2015, French researchers Dr José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.&#91;371&#93;&#91;372&#93;&#91;373&#93; They used PageRank "followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)."&#91;373&#93;
A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.&#91;374&#93;&#91;375&#93;
A 2018 Charles University study concluded that Wikipedia is the most used OER for students of environmental studies (used by 95% of students) and argued that educational institutions should focus their attention on it (for example by supporting Wikipedians in residence).&#91;376&#93;
Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations. One of the most important areas—automatic detection of vandalism&#91;377&#93;&#91;378&#93; and data quality assessment in Wikipedia,&#91;379&#93; may include different measures for articles and infoboxes.&#91;208&#93;
A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.&#91;380&#93;
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),&#91;381&#93; with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).&#91;382&#93; One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu, Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.&#91;383&#93;&#91;384&#93;

Free content, libre content, or free information, is any kind of functional work, work of art, or other creative content that meets the definition of a free cultural work.&#91;1&#93;
A free cultural work (free content) is, according to the definition of Free Cultural Works, one that has no significant legal restriction on people's freedom to:
Free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those copyrighted works whose licenses honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because the Berne Convention in most countries by default grants copyright holders monopolistic control over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.
The public domain is a range of creative works whose copyright has expired or was never established; as well as ideas and facts&#91;nb 1&#93; which are ineligible for copyright. A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such, any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise use the work, without legal ramifications. A work in the public domain or released under a permissive licence may be referred to as "copycenter".&#91;13&#93;


Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably during that time as regards to language (written in a major international or a vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge), cultural perspective (authoritative, ideological, didactic, utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership (education level, background, interests, capabilities), and the technologies available for their production and distribution (hand-written manuscripts, small or large print runs, Internet). As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts, printed versions found a prominent place in libraries, schools and other educational institutions.
The appearance of digital and open-source versions in the 21st century has vastly expanded the accessibility, authorship, readership, and variety of encyclopedia entries.
Diderot&#91;7&#93;
The word encyclopedia (encyclo|pedia) comes from the Koine Greek ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία,&#91;8&#93; transliterated enkyklios paedia, meaning "general education" from enkyklios (ἐγκύκλιος), meaning "circular, recurrent, required regularly, general"&#91;9&#93; and paedia (παιδεία), meaning "education, rearing of a child"; together, the phrase literally translates as "complete instruction" or "complete knowledge".&#91;10&#93; However, the two separate words were reduced to a single word due to a scribal error&#91;11&#93; by copyists of a Latin manuscript edition of Quintillian in 1470.&#91;12&#93; The copyists took this phrase to be a single Greek word, enkyklopaedia, with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the New Latin word "encyclopaedia", which in turn came into English. Because of this compounded word, fifteenth century readers and since have often, and incorrectly, thought that the Roman authors Quintillian and Pliny described an ancient genre.&#91;13&#93;
In the sixteenth century there was a level of ambiguity as to how to use this new word. As several titles illustrate, there was not a settled notion about its spelling nor its status as a noun. For example: Jacobus Philomusus's Margarita philosophica encyclopaediam exhibens (1508); Johannes Aventinus's Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio; Joachimus Fortius Ringelbergius's Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia (1538, 1541); Paul Skalich's Encyclopaediæ, seu orbis disciplinarum, tam sacrarum quam prophanarum, epistemon (1559); Gregor Reisch's Margarita philosophica (1503, retitled Encyclopaedia in 1583); and Samuel Eisenmenger's Cyclopaedia Paracelsica (1585).&#91;15&#93;
There have been two examples of the oldest vernacular use of the compounded word. In approximately 1490, Franciscus Puccius wrote a letter to Politianus thanking him for his Miscellanea, calling it an encyclopedia.&#91;16&#93; More commonly, François Rabelais is cited for his use of the term in Pantagruel (1532).&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93;
Several encyclopedias have names that include the suffix -p(a)edia, to mark the text as belonging to the genre of encyclopedias. An example is Banglapedia (on matters relevant for Bangladesh).
Today in English, the word is most commonly spelled encyclopedia, though encyclopaedia (from encyclopædia) is also used in Britain.&#91;19&#93;
The modern encyclopedia was developed from the dictionary in the 18th century. Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been researched and written by well-educated, well-informed content experts, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work which primarily focuses on alphabetical listing of words and their definitions. Synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited information, analysis or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in understanding the meaning, significance or limitations of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge. An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written in order to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its own veracity.
To address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a subject or discipline. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article is able to treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics.
Four major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:
Some works entitled "dictionaries" are actually similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the Dictionary of the Middle Ages, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and Black's Law Dictionary). The Macquarie Dictionary, Australia's national dictionary, became an encyclopedic dictionary after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.
There are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.&#91;2&#93;&#91;21&#93; There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide linguistic information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the thing for which those words stand.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.&#91;3&#93;
In practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, "encyclopedic" information and linguistic information such as appears in dictionaries.&#91;5&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93; Thus encyclopedias may contain material that is also found in dictionaries, and vice versa.&#91;22&#93; In particular, dictionary entries often contain factual information about the thing named by the word.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;
Information in traditional encyclopedias can be assessed by measures related to such quality dimension as authority, completeness, format, objectivity, style, timeliness and uniqueness.&#91;20&#93;
Encyclopedias have progressed from written form in antiquity, to print in modern times. Today they can also be distributed and displayed electronically.
One of the earliest encyclopedic works to have survived to modern times is the Naturalis Historiae of Pliny the Elder, a Roman statesman living in the first century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and other aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77–79, although Pliny probably never finished editing the work before his death in the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.&#91;23&#93;
Isidore of Seville, one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized for writing the first encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the Etymologiae (The Etymologies) or Origines (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and contemporary. The work has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had he not collected them.
The most popular encyclopedia of the Carolingian Age was the De universo or De rerum naturis by Rabanus Maurus, written about 830; it was based on Etymologiae.&#91;24&#93;
The encyclopedia of Suda, a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30 000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and place in the Greek alphabet.
The early Muslim compilations of knowledge in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the Brethren of Purity of Basra were engaged in their Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity.&#91;25&#93; Notable works include Abu Bakr al-Razi's encyclopedia of science, the Mutazilite Al-Kindi's prolific output of 270 books, and Ibn Sina's medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of universal history (or sociology) from Asharites, al-Tabri, al-Masudi, Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings, Ibn Rustah, al-Athir, and Ibn Khaldun, whose Muqadimmah contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today.
The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the Four Great Books of Song, compiled by the 11th century during the early Song dynasty (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau, amounted to 9.4 ;million Chinese characters in 1000 written volumes. The 'period of the encyclopedists' spanned from the tenth to seventeenth centuries, during which the government of China employed hundreds of scholars to assemble massive encyclopedias.&#91;26&#93; The largest of which is the Yongle Encyclopedia; it was completed in 1408 and consisted of almost 23,000 folio volumes in manuscript form.&#91;26&#93;
In late medieval Europe, several authors had the ambition of compiling the sum of human knowledge in a certain field or overall, for example Bartholomew of England, Vincent of Beauvais, Radulfus Ardens, Sydrac, Brunetto Latini, Giovanni da Sangiminiano, Pierre Bersuire. Some were women, like Hildegard of Bingen and Herrad of Landsberg. The most successful of those publications were the Speculum maius (Great Mirror) of Vincent of Beauvais and the De proprietatibus rerum (On the Properties of Things) by Bartholomew of England. The latter was translated (or adapted) into French, Provençal, Italian, English, Flemish, Anglo-Norman, Spanish, and German during the Middle Ages. Both were written in the middle of the 13th century. No medieval encyclopedia bore the title Encyclopaedia – they were often called On nature (De natura, De naturis rerum), Mirror (Speculum maius, Speculum universale), Treasure (Trésor).&#91;27&#93;
Medieval encyclopedias were all hand-copied and thus available mostly to wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning; they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.&#91;28&#93;
During the Renaissance, the creation of printing allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The De expetendis et fugiendis rebus by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by Aldo Manuzio in Venice. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by Archimedes), newly discovered and translated. The Margarita Philosophica by Gregor Reisch, printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts.
The term encyclopaedia was coined by 16th-century humanists who misread copies of their texts of Pliny&#91;29&#93; and Quintilian,&#91;30&#93; and combined the two Greek words "enkyklios paedia" into one word, έγκυκλοπαιδεία.&#91;31&#93; The phrase enkyklios paedia (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word encyclopaedia came from him.
The first work titled in this way was the Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio written by Johannes Aventinus in 1517.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The English physician and philosopher, Sir Thomas Browne used the word 'encyclopaedia' in 1646 in the preface to the reader to define his Pseudodoxia Epidemica, a major work of the 17th-century scientific revolution. Browne structured his encyclopaedia upon the time-honoured scheme of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends through the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary, and cosmological worlds. Pseudodoxia Epidemica was a European best-seller, translated into French, Dutch, and German as well as Latin it went through no fewer than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672.
Financial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. During the Renaissance, middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. When publishing at the same rate became financially impossible, they turned to subscriptions and serial publications. This was risky for publishers because they had to find people that would pay all upfront or make payments. When this worked, capital would rise and there would be a steady income for encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws. Some publishers would copy another publisher's work to produce an encyclopedia faster and cheaper so consumers did not have to pay a lot and they would sell more. Encyclopedias made it to where middle-class citizens could basically have a small library in their own house. Europeans were becoming more curious about their society around them causing them to revolt against their government.&#91;32&#93;
The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, Chambers' Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (1728), and the Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1751 onwards), as well as Encyclopædia Britannica and the Conversations-Lexikon, were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's Lexicon Technicum of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content "A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves".
Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia and the Children's Encyclopaedia appeared in the early 1920s.
In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were World Book and Funk and Wagnalls. As many as 90% were sold door to door. Jack Lynch says in his book You Could Look It Up that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, “They were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility."  A 1961 World Book ad said, “You are holding your family’s future in your hands right now,” while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.&#91;33&#93;
The second half of the 20th century also saw the proliferation of specialized encyclopedias that compiled topics in specific fields, mainly to support specific industries and professionals. This trend has continued. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size now exist for most if not all academic disciplines, including such narrow topics such as bioethics.
By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on CD-ROMs for use with personal computers. Microsoft's Encarta, published between 1993 and 2009, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with both video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images.&#91;34&#93;
Digital technologies and online crowdsourcing allowed encyclopedias to break away from traditional limitations in both breath and depth of topics covered. Wikipedia, a crowd-sourced, multilingual, open licence, free online encyclopedia supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation and open source MediaWiki software opened in 2001. Unlike commercial online encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica Online, which are written by experts, Wikipedia is collaboratively created and maintained by volunteer editors, organized by collaboratively agreed guidelines and user-roles. Most contributors use pseudonyms and stay anonymous. Content is therefore reviewed, checked, kept or removed based on its own intrinsic value and external sources supporting it.
Traditional encyclopedias' reliability, on their side, stand upon authorship and associated professional expertise. Many academics, teachers, and journalists rejected and continue to reject open, crowd sourced encyclopedias, especially Wikipedia, as a reliable source of information, and Wikipedia is itself not a reliable source according to its own standards because of its openly editable and anonymous crowdsourcing model.&#91;35&#93; A study by Nature in 2005 found that Wikipedia's science articles were roughly comparable in accuracy to those of Encyclopædia Britannica, containing the same number of serious errors and about 1/3 more minor factual inaccuracies, but that Wikipedia's writing tended to be confusing and less readable.&#91;36&#93; Encyclopædia Britannica rejected the study's conclusions, deeming the study fatally flawed.&#91;37&#93; As of February 2014, it had 18 ;billion page views and nearly 500 ;million unique visitors each month.&#91;38&#93; Critics argue Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;
There are several much smaller, usually more specialized, encyclopedias on various themes, sometimes dedicated to a specific geographic region or time period.&#91;41&#93; One example is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
As of the early 2020s, the largest encyclopedias are the Chinese Baidu Baike (16 ;million articles) and Hudong Baike (13 ;million), followed by Wikipedias for English (6 ;million), German (+2 ;million) and French (+2 ;million).&#91;42&#93; More than a dozen other Wikipedias have 1 ;million articles or more, of variable quality and length.&#91;42&#93; Measuring an Encyclopedia's size by its articles is an ambiguous method since the online Chinese encyclopedias cited above allow multiple articles on the same topic, while Wikipedias allow automated creation of nearly empty articles.

English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula on the Baltic Sea. English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as Latin and French.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;
English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic (Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are collectively called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England; this was a period in which English was influenced by Old French, in particular though its Old Norman dialect.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.&#91;11&#93;
Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation and law.&#91;12&#93;
English is the largest language by number of speakers,&#91;13&#93; and the third most-spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish.&#91;14&#93; It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. It is estimated that there are over 2 ;billion speakers of English.&#91;15&#93; English is the majority native language in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa and South Asia.&#91;16&#93; It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. English speakers are called "Anglophones".
Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern, with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed subject–verb–object word order and a complex syntax.&#91;17&#93; Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. The variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions—in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, idioms, grammar, and spelling—can often be understood by speakers of different dialects, but in extreme cases can lead to confusion or even mutual unintelligibility between English speakers.
English is an Indo-European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.&#91;18&#93; Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the Frisian North Sea coast, whose languages gradually evolved into the Anglic languages in the British Isles, and into the Frisian languages and Low German/Low Saxon on the continent. The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the Anglo-Frisian languages, are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages, though this grouping remains debated.&#91;7&#93; Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English.&#91;19&#93; Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots&#91;20&#93; and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy (Yola) dialects of Ireland.&#91;21&#93;
Like Icelandic and Faroese, the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences. It has since evolved considerably. English is not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.&#91;22&#93;
Unlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades—but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole—a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93;
English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and Swedish.&#91;25&#93; These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, the use of modal verbs, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's and Verner's laws. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see Phonological history of Old English § ;Palatalization).&#91;26&#93;
The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066 CE). Old English developed from a set of North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. From the 5th century CE, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the 7th century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain (43–409 CE): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93; England and English (originally Ænglaland and Ænglisc) are named after the Angles.&#91;30&#93;
Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects (Mercian and Northumbrian) and the Saxon dialects, Kentish and West Saxon.&#91;31&#93; Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety.&#91;32&#93; The epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, Cædmon's Hymn, is written in Northumbrian.&#91;33&#93; Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a runic script.&#91;34&#93; By the 6th century, a Latin alphabet was adopted, written with half-uncial letterforms. It included the runic letters wynn &#x27e8;ƿ&#x27e9; and thorn &#x27e8;þ&#x27e9;, and the modified Latin letters eth &#x27e8;ð&#x27e9;, and ash &#x27e8;æ&#x27e9;.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93;
Old English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and has a few verb inflections (speak, speaks, speaking, spoke, spoken), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93;
The translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000 CE shows examples of case endings (nominative plural, accusative plural, genitive singular) and a verb ending (present plural):
John of Trevisa, ca. 1385&#91;40&#93;
From the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through language contact into Middle English. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200–1450.
First, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in direct contact with Norse speakers. An element of Norse influence that persists in all English varieties today is the group of pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).&#91;41&#93;
With the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with Old French, in particular with the Old Norman dialect. The Norman language in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman.&#91;9&#93; Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.&#91;8&#93; Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,&#91;42&#93; and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.&#91;43&#93; In the Wycliffe Bible of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written:
Here the plural suffix -n on the verb have is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and French features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.&#91;45&#93;
The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.
The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;
English began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.&#91;48&#93; Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn ɡn sw/ in knight, gnat, and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.&#91;49&#93;
In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:
This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of of instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (ayre) and word replacements (bird originally meaning "nestling" had replaced OE fugol).&#91;50&#93;
By the late 18th century, the British Empire had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.&#91;51&#93;&#91;12&#93; England continued to form new colonies, and these later developed their own norms for speech and writing. English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93; In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC&#91;55&#93; and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93; In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.&#91;58&#93;
As Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.&#91;59&#93;
In modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as he and him, she and her, who and whom), and SVO word-order is mostly fixed.&#91;59&#93; Some changes, such as the use of do-support have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word "do" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.&#91;60&#93; Now, do-support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. more polite instead of politer). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power.&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93;

As of 2016&#91;update&#93;, 400 ;million people spoke English as their first language, and 1.1 ;billion spoke it as a secondary language.&#91;64&#93; English is the largest language by number of speakers. English is spoken by communities on every continent and on islands in all the major oceans.&#91;65&#93;
The countries where English is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how English is used in each country. The "inner circle"&#91;66&#93; countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.
Braj Kachru distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a three circles model.&#91;66&#93; In his model,
Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.&#91;67&#93;
Countries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States (at least 231 ;million),&#91;68&#93; the United Kingdom (60 ;million),&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93; Canada (19 ;million),&#91;72&#93; Australia (at least 17 ;million),&#91;73&#93; South Africa (4.8 ;million),&#91;74&#93; Ireland (4.2 ;million), and New Zealand (3.7 ;million).&#91;75&#93; In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.&#91;76&#93; The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.&#91;67&#93;
Estimates of the numbers of second language and foreign-language English speakers vary greatly from 470 ;million to more than 1 ;billion, depending on how proficiency is defined.&#91;16&#93; Linguist David Crystal estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.&#91;77&#93; In Kachru's three-circles model, the "outer circle" countries are countries such as the Philippines,&#91;78&#93; Jamaica,&#91;79&#93; India, Pakistan, Singapore,&#91;80&#93; Malaysia and Nigeria&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93; with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government.&#91;83&#93;
Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.&#91;76&#93; Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,&#91;76&#93; and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.&#91;76&#93;
In the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the "expanding circle".&#91;84&#93; The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.&#91;83&#93; For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,&#91;85&#93; and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the "outer circle" and "expanding circle". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.&#91;86&#93;
Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.&#91;87&#93; Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.&#91;88&#93; Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.&#91;89&#93;

English is a pluricentric language, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93;&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93; But English is not a divided language,&#91;94&#93; despite a long-standing joke originally attributed to George Bernard Shaw that the United Kingdom and the United States are "two countries separated by a common language".&#91;95&#93; Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents,&#91;96&#93; but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.&#91;97&#93;
American listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.&#91;98&#93; Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.&#91;99&#93;
The settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.&#91;100&#93; The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,&#91;101&#93;&#91;68&#93; although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US.&#91;102&#93;&#91;103&#93;
English has ceased to be an "English language" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English.&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93; Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.&#91;106&#93; Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an "Afro-Saxon" language community that unites Africans from different countries.&#91;107&#93;
As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93;&#91;108&#93; For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.&#91;109&#93; English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.&#91;110&#93; However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.&#91;111&#93;&#91;112&#93; David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,&#91;113&#93; but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.&#91;114&#93;
Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,&#91;56&#93;&#91;115&#93; is also regarded as the first world language.&#91;116&#93;&#91;117&#93; English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.&#91;117&#93; English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages&#91;118&#93; Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring&#91;119&#93; and aviation.&#91;120&#93; English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.&#91;121&#93; It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.&#91;122&#93; By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II, English had become pre-eminent&#91;123&#93; and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.&#91;124&#93; It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.&#91;125&#93; Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.
Many regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),&#91;57&#93; and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.&#91;126&#93;
Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93; In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll (conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU), 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.&#91;127&#93;
A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine&#91;128&#93; and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.&#91;129&#93;
International communities such as international business people may use English as an auxiliary language, with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. The trademarked Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words, designed to represent the highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar.&#91;130&#93; Other examples include Simple English.
The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about language death,&#91;131&#93; and to claims of linguistic imperialism,&#91;132&#93; and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.&#91;133&#93;
Although some scholars&#91;who?&#93; mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.&#91;134&#93; English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.&#91;135&#93; Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.&#91;136&#93;&#91;137&#93;
The phonetics and phonology of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes. &#91;138&#93; This overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States: Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA). (See § ;Dialects, accents, and varieties, below.)
The phonetic symbols used below are from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93;&#91;141&#93;
Most English dialects share the same 24 ;consonant phonemes. The consonant inventory shown below is valid for California English,&#91;142&#93; and for RP.&#91;143&#93;
* Conventionally transcribed /r/
In the table, when obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as /p b/, /tʃ dʒ/, and /s z/, the first is fortis (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as /p tʃ s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as /b dʒ z/, and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as /p/ have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [pʰ] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [p̚] or pre-glottalised [ʔp] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than nib [nɪˑb̥] (see below).&#91;144&#93; 
In RP, the lateral approximant /l/, has two main allophones (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain [l], as in light, and the dark or velarised [ɫ], as in full.&#91;145&#93; GA has dark l in most cases.&#91;146&#93;
All sonorants (liquids /l, r/ and nasals /m, n, ŋ/) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.&#91;147&#93;
The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.&#91;148&#93;
In RP, vowel length is phonemic; long vowels are marked with a triangular colon &#x27e8;ː&#x27e9; in the table above, such as the vowel of need [niːd] as opposed to bid [bɪd]. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.
In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like /t tʃ f/, but not before lenis consonants like /d dʒ v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of rich [rɪtʃ], neat [nit], and safe [seɪ̯f] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge [rɪˑdʒ], need [niˑd], and save [seˑɪ̯v], and the vowel of light [laɪ̯t] is shorter than that of lie [laˑɪ̯]. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.&#91;149&#93;
The vowel /ə/ only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.&#91;150&#93;&#91;151&#93; Some dialects do not contrast /ɪ/ and /ə/ in unstressed positions, so that rabbit and abbot rhyme and Lenin and Lennon are homophonous, a dialect feature called weak vowel merger.&#91;152&#93; GA /ɜr/ and /ər/ are realised as an r-coloured vowel [ɚ], as in further [ˈfɚðɚ] (phonemically /ˈfɜrðər/), which in RP is realised as [ˈfəːðə] (phonemically /ˈfɜːðə/).&#91;153&#93;
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint /sprɪnt/, and end with up to four, as in texts /teksts/. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word strengths /strɛŋkθs/ is thus an example of the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly; s and a voiceless stop, as in stay; and s, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in string.&#91;154&#93; Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable-initial position, and /ŋ/ only in syllable-final position.&#91;155&#93;
Stress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not.&#91;156&#93; Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.
Stress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word contract is stressed on the first syllable (/ˈkɒntrækt/ KON-trakt) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (/kənˈtrækt/ kən-TRAKT) for most meanings (for example, "reduce in size") when used as a verb.&#91;157&#93;&#91;158&#93;&#91;159&#93; Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /ɒ/, but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /ə/. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. a burnout (/ˈbɜːrnaʊt/) versus to burn out (/ˈbɜːrn ˈaʊt/), and a hotdog (/ˈhɒtdɒɡ/) versus a hot dog (/ˈhɒt ˈdɒɡ/).&#91;160&#93;
In terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.&#91;161&#93; Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.&#91;162&#93;
Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table "Varieties of Standard English and their features".&#91;163&#93;
English has undergone many historical sound changes, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.&#91;164&#93;&#91;165&#93;
Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless &#91;ʍ&#93; sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced [w] in wine, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [w], a dialect feature called wine–whine merger. The unvoiced velar fricative sound /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes loch /lɔx/ from lock /lɔk/. Accents like Cockney with "h-dropping" lack the glottal fricative /h/, and dialects with th-stopping and th-fronting like African American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives /θ, ð/, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives /f, v/.&#91;166&#93;&#91;167&#93; Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod-dropping, yod-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.&#91;168&#93;
General American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the syllable coda). GA is a rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces /r/ at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide /r/ like RP or keep it like GA.&#91;169&#93;
There is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels /æ ɑː ɒ ɔː/. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three /æ ɑ ɔ/,&#91;170&#93; and in Canadian English, they merge to two /æ ɑ/.&#91;171&#93; In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table "Dialects and open vowels" shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur.
As is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.&#91;172&#93; English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.&#91;173&#93;
Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs speak/spoke and foot/feet) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as love/loved, hand/hands).&#91;174&#93; Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (he/him, who/whom) and in the inflection of the copula verb to be.&#91;174&#93;
The seven-word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:&#91;175&#93;
English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns.&#91;176&#93;
Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.&#91;177&#93;
Regular plural formation:
Irregular plural formation:
Possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.&#91;173&#93;
Possessive constructions:
Nouns can form noun phrases (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.&#91;178&#93; Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.&#91;173&#93; For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.
The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.&#91;179&#93;
Adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.&#91;180&#93; In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.
Some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, the boy is smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy.&#91;181&#93; There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.&#91;182&#93;
English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both in the sense of the previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb).&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93; Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise, the objective case is used.&#91;185&#93; While grammarians such as Henry Sweet&#91;186&#93; and Otto Jespersen&#91;187&#93; noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002), retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.
Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. the chair is mine).&#91;188&#93; The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old 2nd person singular familiar pronoun thou acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned), and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse found in Australian English and ye in Irish English.
Pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation—for example, the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence I already told you that. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. "he sent it to himself" or "she braced herself for impact").&#91;189&#93;
Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. with the dog, for my friend, to school, in England.&#91;190&#93; Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.&#91;190&#93; For example, in the phrase I gave it to him, the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb to give. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, "with her", "to me", "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as that of Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002:598–600) no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.
English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.&#91;181&#93; Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.&#91;191&#93;&#91;192&#93;
Most verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.&#91;193&#93; The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is am, the third person singular form is is, and the form are is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.
English has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed, and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.&#91;191&#93;
English does not have a morphologised future tense.&#91;194&#93; Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall.&#91;195&#93; Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to.&#91;196&#93;
Further aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily have and be, which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (I have run vs. I was running), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (I had been running) and present perfect (I have been running).&#91;197&#93;
For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).&#91;195&#93;
An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.&#91;198&#93; For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.
English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment).&#91;199&#93; In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term "phrasal verb". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.
The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.&#91;173&#93; Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix -ly. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly, the adverb quickly is derived in this way from the adjective quick. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.
Modern English syntax language is moderately analytic.&#91;200&#93; It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.
English word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject–verb–object (SVO).&#91;201&#93; The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it.
In most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.&#91;202&#93; The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:
An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.&#91;203&#93; The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:
Indirect objects (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as I gave Jane the book or in a prepositional phrase, such as I gave the book to Jane.&#91;204&#93;
In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.&#91;205&#93; Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.)&#91;206&#93; In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.&#91;207&#93;
English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.
The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in "I did shut the fridge." However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *I know not—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like I do not (don't) know. The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *Know you him?; grammatical rules require Do you know him?&#91;208&#93;
Negation is done with the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not -n't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.&#91;209&#93;
Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).&#91;210&#93;
Both yes–no questions and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) appear in a fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.&#91;211&#93;
While English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee.&#91;212&#93; Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.
Focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, the girl was stung by a bee (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or The girl was stung by a bee (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).&#91;213&#93; Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an "afterthought".&#91;214&#93;
Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).&#91;215&#93; Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.&#91;216&#93;
English is a rich language in terms of vocabulary, containing more synonyms than any other language.&#91;132&#93; There are words which appear on the surface to mean exactly the same thing but which, in fact, have slightly different shades of meaning and must be chosen appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message intended. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1989.&#91;217&#93; Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 ;million words—but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms.&#91;218&#93;
Due to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly, and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora,&#91;219&#93; collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.&#91;218&#93;&#91;220&#93;
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,&#91;221&#93; using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,&#91;218&#93;&#91;220&#93; producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick.&#91;221&#93; A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (-hood, -ness, -ing, -ility) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin).
Formation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example television or optometry) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the "international scientific vocabulary" (ISV) when compiling Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms,&#91;222&#93; words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. NATO, laser).

English, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.&#91;224&#93; The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.&#91;225&#93; The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are mainly the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.&#91;218&#93;
But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of "Latinate" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.&#91;226&#93; Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers.&#91;227&#93; Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as egg and knife.&#91;228&#93;
English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.&#91;220&#93;&#91;218&#93; Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.&#91;229&#93; English continues to gain new loanwords and calques ("loan translations") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.&#91;230&#93;
English has formal and informal speech registers; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.&#91;231&#93;&#91;232&#93;
English has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.&#91;226&#93;&#91;233&#93; The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.&#91;234&#93; That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.&#91;235&#93; Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.&#91;236&#93; Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.&#91;236&#93;
Since the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.&#91;34&#93; The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
The spelling system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.&#91;237&#93; Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace.&#91;46&#93; Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.&#91;238&#93; There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.&#91;239&#93;
Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.&#91;240&#93; Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words photograph, photography, and photographic,&#91;240&#93; or the words electricity and electrical. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is "near-optimal",&#91;237&#93; there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.&#91;241&#93; The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.&#91;242&#93; Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.&#91;243&#93;
Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z represent, respectively, the phonemes /b, d, f, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/. The letters c and g normally represent /k/ and /ɡ/, but there is also a soft c pronounced /s/, and a soft g pronounced /dʒ/. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for /tʃ/, sh for /ʃ/, th for /θ/ or /ð/, ng for /ŋ/, qu for /kw/, and ph for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin&#91;240&#93; or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.&#91;244&#93;
For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (a, e, i, o, u, w, y). As a result, some "long vowels" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the oa in boat, the ow in how, and the ay in stay), or the historically based silent e (as in note and cake).&#91;241&#93;
The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.&#91;245&#93; Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.&#91;240&#93; Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.&#91;246&#93;&#91;247&#93; Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.&#91;248&#93;
English writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.&#91;249&#93;
Dialectologists identify many English dialects, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE).&#91;250&#93; There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.
As the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most diverse dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the Received Pronunciation (RP), an educated dialect of South East England, is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.&#91;251&#93;
Nonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact, only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.&#91;252&#93; There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.&#91;253&#93; Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered "non-standard" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is H-dropping, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England—yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.&#91;254&#93;
English in England can be divided into four major dialect regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.&#91;255&#93;
Since the 15th century, southeastern England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the south-east led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.&#91;256&#93;&#91;257&#93;&#91;258&#93; Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R (drawing is pronounced drawring /ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/), t-glottalisation (Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po'er /poʔʌ/), and the pronunciation of th- as /f/ (thanks pronounced fanks) or /v/ (bother pronounced bover).&#91;259&#93;
Scots is today considered a separate language from English, but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English&#91;260&#93; and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, Scottish English comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.&#91;261&#93;
In Ireland, various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area surrounding Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.&#91;21&#93;&#91;262&#93;
North American English is fairly homogeneous compared to British English. Today, American accent variation is often increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,&#91;263&#93; though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,&#91;264&#93; known collectively as General American (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves (such as Midland and Western American English).&#91;265&#93;&#91;266&#93;&#91;267&#93; In most American and Canadian English dialects, rhoticity (or r-fulness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (r-dropping) becoming associated with lower prestige and social class especially after World War II; this contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.&#91;268&#93;
Separate from GA are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems, historically including Southern American English, English of the coastal Northeast (famously including Eastern New England English and New York City English), and African American Vernacular English, all of which are historically non-rhotic. Canadian English, except for the Atlantic provinces and perhaps Quebec, may be classified under GA as well, but it often shows the raising of the vowels /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ before voiceless consonants, as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation standards.&#91;269&#93;
In Southern American English, the most populous American "accent group" outside of GA,&#91;270&#93; rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's historical non-rhotic prestige.&#91;271&#93;&#91;272&#93;&#91;273&#93; Southern accents are colloquially described as a "drawl" or "twang,"&#91;274&#93; being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide-deleting in the /aɪ/ vowel (e.g. pronouncing spy almost like spa), the "Southern breaking" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word "press" almost like "pray-us"),&#91;275&#93; the pin–pen merger, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.&#91;276&#93;
Today spoken primarily by working- and middle-class African Americans, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard older Southern dialects. A minority of linguists,&#91;277&#93; contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.&#91;278&#93; AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggests it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of "broken" or "uneducated" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by a large speech community.&#91;279&#93;&#91;280&#93;
Since 1788, English has been spoken in Oceania, and Australian English has developed as a first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.&#91;281&#93; Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are).&#91;282&#93;&#91;283&#93; New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.&#91;284&#93;&#91;285&#93;&#91;286&#93;
The first significant exposure of the Philippines to the English language occurred in 1762 when the British occupied Manila during the Seven Years' War, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946, and remains an official language of the Philippines. Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, from street signs and marquees, government documents and forms, courtrooms, the media and entertainment industries, the business sector, and other aspects of daily life. One such usage that is also prominent in the country is in speech, where most Filipinos from Manila would use or have been exposed to Taglish, a form of code-switching between Tagalog and English. A similar code-switching method is used by urban native speakers of Visayan languages called Bislish.
English is spoken widely in southern Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today, about 9 percent of the South African population speaks South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is alone among non-rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.&#91;287&#93; Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.&#91;288&#93; Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. pin pronounced [pɪn] rather than as [pʰɪn] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [ɾ] instead of as the more common fricative.&#91;289&#93;
Nigerian English is a dialect of English spoken in Nigeria.&#91;290&#93; It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. senior wife). Over 150 ;million Nigerians speak English.&#91;291&#93;
Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Belize. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.&#91;292&#93; Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code-switching between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as "basilect" and the more RP-like forms serving as the "acrolect", the most formal register.&#91;293&#93;
Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs [eː] and [oː] or even the reverse diphthongs [ie] and [uo] (e.g. bay and boat pronounced [bʲeː] and [bʷoːt]). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that "child" is pronounced [t͡ʃail] and "wind" [win].&#91;294&#93;&#91;295&#93;&#91;296&#93;
As a historical legacy, Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [ʈ] and [ɖ]) and the replacement of /θ/ and /ð/ with dentals [t̪] and [d̪]. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent &#x27e8;h&#x27e9; found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop [ɡʱ].&#91;297&#93;

Sega Corporation&#91;a&#93; is a Japanese multinational video game developer and publisher headquartered in Shinagawa, Tokyo. Its international branches, Sega of America and Sega Europe, are respectively headquartered in Irvine, California, and London.  Sega's arcade division existed as Sega Interactive Co., Ltd. from 2015 to 2020.  Sega is a subsidiary of Sega Group Corporation, which is, in turn, a part of Sega Sammy Holdings.  From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed video game consoles.
Sega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as Nihon Goraku Bussan&#91;b&#93; on June 3, 1960; shortly after, the company acquired the assets of its predecessor, Service Games of Japan. Five years later, the company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd., after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of coin-operated games. Sega developed its first coin-operated game, Periscope, in the late 1960s. Sega was sold to Gulf and Western Industries in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the SG-1000 and Master System but struggled against competitors such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.  In 1984, Sega executives David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama led a management buyout of the company with backing from CSK Corporation.
Sega released its next console, the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. The Genesis struggled against the competition in Japan, but found success overseas after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, in the U.S. Later in the decade, Sega suffered several commercial failures such as the 32X, Saturn, and Dreamcast consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a third-party developer and publisher and was acquired by Sammy Corporation in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable. Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, Sega Corporation, being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed Sega Corporation.
Sega has produced several multi-million-selling game franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Total War, and Yakuza, and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates amusement arcades and produces other entertainment products, including Sega Toys. Sega is recognized for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations. In more recent years, it has been criticized for its business decisions and the quality of its creative output.
In 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert formed Standard Games in Honolulu, Hawaii. Their aim was to provide coin-operated amusement machines, including slot machines, to military bases as the increase in personnel with the onset of World War II would create demand for entertainment. After the war, the founders sold Standard Games in 1945, and in 1946 established Service Games, named for the military focus.&#91;1&#93; After the United States government outlawed slot machines in its territories in 1952, Bromley sent employees Richard Stewart and Ray LeMaire to Tokyo to establish Service Games of Japan to provide coin-operated slot machines to U.S. bases in Japan.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; A year later, all five men established Service Games Panama to control the entities of Service Games worldwide.  The company expanded over the next seven years to include distribution in South Korea, the Philippines, and South Vietnam.&#91;5&#93; The name Sega, an abbreviation of Service Games,&#91;6&#93; was first used in 1954 on a slot machine, the Diamond Star.&#91;5&#93;
Due to notoriety arising from investigations into criminal business practices, Service Games of Japan was dissolved on May 31, 1960.&#91;5&#93; On June 3,&#91;7&#93; Bromley established two companies to take over its business activities, Nihon Goraku Bussan and Nihon Kikai Seizō.&#91;c&#93; The two new companies purchased all of Service Games of Japan's assets.  Kikai Seizō, doing business as Sega, Inc., focused on manufacturing slot machines.  Goraku Bussan, doing business under Stewart as Utamatic, Inc., served as a distributor and operator of coin-operated machines, particularly jukeboxes.&#91;5&#93;&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;  The companies merged in 1964, retaining the Nihon Goraku Bussan name.&#91;5&#93;
During the same time frame, David Rosen, an American officer in the United States Air Force stationed in Japan, launched a photo booth business in Tokyo in 1954.&#91;2&#93; This company became Rosen Enterprises, and in 1957 began importing coin-operated games into Japan. In 1965, Nihon Goraku Bussan acquired Rosen Enterprises to form Sega Enterprises, Ltd.&#91;d&#93;  Rosen was installed as the CEO and managing director, while Stewart was named president and LeMaire was the director of planning.  Shortly afterward, Sega stopped leasing to military bases and moved its focus from slot machines to coin-operated amusement machines.&#91;10&#93; Its imports included Rock-Ola jukeboxes, pinball games by Williams, and gun games by Midway Manufacturing.&#91;11&#93;
Because Sega imported second-hand machines that required frequent maintenance, it began constructing replacement guns and flippers for its imported games.  According to former Sega director Akira Nagai, this led to the company developing its own games.&#91;11&#93; The first electromechanical game Sega manufactured was the submarine simulator Periscope, released worldwide in the late 1960s. It featured light and sound effects considered innovative, and was successful in Japan. It was exported to malls and department stores in Europe and the United States, and helped standardize the 25-cent-per-play cost for arcade games in the U.S. Sega was surprised by the success, and for the next two years, the company produced and exported between eight and ten games per year.&#91;12&#93; Despite this, rampant piracy in the industry would lead to Sega stepping away from exporting its games around 1970.&#91;13&#93;
In 1969, Sega was sold to the American conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries, although Rosen remained CEO.  In 1974, Gulf and Western made Sega Enterprises, Ltd., a subsidiary of an American company renamed Sega Enterprises, Inc. Sega released Pong-Tron, its first video-based game, in 1973.&#91;13&#93; Despite late competition from Taito's hit arcade game Space Invaders in 1978,&#91;11&#93; Sega prospered from the arcade game boom of the late 1970s, with revenues climbing to over US$100 ;million by 1979.  During this period, Sega acquired Gremlin Industries, which manufactured microprocessor-based arcade games,&#91;14&#93; and Esco Boueki, a coin-op distributor founded and owned by Hayao Nakayama. Nakayama was placed in a management role of Sega's Japanese operations.&#91;15&#93; In the early 1980s, Sega was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues rose to $214 ;million.&#91;16&#93;  1979 saw the release of Head On, which introduced the "eat the dots" gameplay Namco later used in Pac-Man.&#91;17&#93; In 1981, Sega licensed and released Frogger, its most successful game until then.&#91;18&#93;  In 1982, Sega introduced the first game with isometric graphics, Zaxxon.&#91;19&#93;
Following a downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982, Gulf and Western sold its North American arcade game manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing in September 1983.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;  Gulf and Western retained Sega's North American R&amp;D operation and its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd.  With its arcade business in decline, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. president Nakayama advocated for the company to use its hardware expertise to move into the home consumer market in Japan.&#91;23&#93;  This led to Sega's development of a computer, the SC-3000.  Learning that Nintendo was developing a games-only console, the Famicom, Sega developed its first home video game system, the SG-1000, alongside the SC-3000.&#91;24&#93; Rebranded versions of the SG-1000 were released in several other markets worldwide.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;  The SG-1000 sold 160,000 units in 1983, which far exceeded Sega's projection of 50,000 in the first year,&#91;24&#93; but was outpaced by the Famicom. This was in part because Nintendo expanded its game library by courting third-party developers, whereas Sega was hesitant to collaborate with companies with which it was competing in the arcades.&#91;24&#93;
In 1985, Sega began working on the Mark III,&#91;32&#93; a redesigned SG-1000.&#91;33&#93; For North America, Sega rebranded the Mark III as the Master System,&#91;34&#93; with a futuristic design intended to appeal to Western tastes.&#91;35&#93;  The Mark III was released in Japan in October 1985.&#91;36&#93;  Despite featuring more powerful hardware than the Famicom in some ways, it was unsuccessful at launch. As Nintendo required third-party developers not to publish their Famicom games on other consoles, Sega developed its own games and obtained the rights to port games from other developers.&#91;32&#93;  To help market the console in North America, Sega planned to sell the Master System as a toy, similar to how Nintendo had done with the Nintendo Entertainment System. Sega partnered with Tonka, an American toy company, to make use of Tonka's expertise in the toy industry.&#91;37&#93; Ineffective marketing by Tonka handicapped sales of the Master System.&#91;38&#93;  By early 1992, production had ceased in North America. The Master System sold between 1.5 ;million and 2 ;million units in the region.&#91;39&#93; This was less market share in North America than both Nintendo and Atari, which controlled 80 percent and 12 percent of the market respectively.&#91;40&#93; The Master System was eventually a success in Europe, where it outsold the NES by a considerable margin.&#91;41&#93;  As late as 1993, the Master System's active installed user base in Europe was 6.25 ;million units.&#91;41&#93;  The Master System has had continued success in Brazil. New versions continue to be released by Sega's partner in the region, Tectoy.&#91;42&#93; By 2016, the Master System had sold 8 ;million units in Brazil.&#91;43&#93;
During 1984, Sega opened its European division of arcade distribution, Sega Europe.&#91;44&#93;  It re-entered the North American arcade market in 1985 with the establishment of Sega Enterprises USA at the end of a deal with Bally. The release of Hang-On in 1985 would prove successful in the region, becoming so popular that Sega struggled to keep up with demand for the game.&#91;45&#93; UFO Catcher was introduced in 1985 and as of 2005 was Japan's most commonly installed claw crane game.&#91;46&#93;  In 1986, Sega of America was established to manage the company's consumer products in North America, beginning with marketing the Master System.&#91;47&#93; During Sega's partnership with Tonka, Sega of America relinquished marketing and distribution of the console and focused on customer support and some localization of titles.&#91;37&#93; Out Run, released in 1986, became Sega's best selling arcade cabinet of the 1980s.&#91;48&#93;  Former Sega director Akira Nagai stated that Hang-On and Out Run helped to pull the arcade game market out of the 1982 downturn and created new genres of video games.&#91;11&#93;
With the arcade game market once again growing, Sega was one of the most recognized game brands at the end of the 1980s. In the arcades, the company focused on releasing games to appeal to diverse tastes, including racing games and side-scrollers.&#91;49&#93; Sega released the Master System's successor, the Mega Drive, in Japan on October 29, 1988. The launch was overshadowed by Nintendo's release of Super Mario Bros. 3 a week earlier. Positive coverage from magazines Famitsu and Beep! helped establish a following, but Sega only shipped 400,000 units in the first year.&#91;50&#93;  The Mega Drive struggled to compete against the Famicom&#91;51&#93; and lagged behind Nintendo's Super Famicom and NEC's PC Engine in Japanese sales throughout the 16-bit era.&#91;52&#93;  For the North American launch, where the console was renamed Genesis, Sega had no sales and marketing organization. After Atari declined an offer to market the console in the region, Sega launched it through its own Sega of America subsidiary. The Genesis was launched in New York City and Los Angeles on August 14, 1989, and in the rest of North America later that year.&#91;53&#93;  The European version of the Mega Drive was released in September 1990.&#91;54&#93;
Former Atari executive and new Sega of America president Michael Katz developed a two-part strategy to build sales in North America. The first part involved a marketing campaign to challenge Nintendo and emphasize the more arcade-like experience available on the Genesis,&#91;53&#93;&#91;55&#93; with slogans including "Genesis does what Nintendon't".&#91;50&#93; Since Nintendo owned the console rights to most arcade games of the time, the second part involved creating a library of games which used the names and likenesses of celebrities, such as Michael Jackson's Moonwalker and Joe Montana Football.&#91;2&#93;&#91;56&#93; Nonetheless, Sega had difficulty overcoming Nintendo's ubiquity in homes.&#91;57&#93; Despite being tasked by Nakayama to sell one million units in the first year, Katz and Sega of America sold only 500,000.&#91;50&#93;
After the launch of the Genesis, Sega sought a new flagship series to compete with Nintendo's Mario series.&#91;59&#93; Its new character, Sonic the Hedgehog, went on to feature in one of the best-selling video game franchises in history.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog began with a tech demo created by Yuji Naka involving a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a winding tube; this was fleshed out with Naoto Ohshima's character design and levels conceived by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara.&#91;62&#93; Sonic's color was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo; his shoes were inspired by Michael Jackson's boots, and his personality by Bill Clinton's "can-do" attitude.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93;
Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske as CEO of Sega of America in mid-1990, and Katz departed soon after. Kalinske knew little about the video game market, but surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the razor-and-blades business model, he developed a four-point plan: cut the price of the Genesis, create a U.S. team to develop games targeted at the American market, expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with Sonic the Hedgehog. The Japanese board of directors disapproved,&#91;57&#93; but it was approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it."&#91;50&#93; In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog,&#91;57&#93; the Genesis outsold its main competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. By January 1992, Sega controlled 65 percent of the 16-bit console market.&#91;66&#93; Sega outsold Nintendo for four consecutive Christmas seasons&#91;67&#93; due to the Genesis' head start, lower price, and a larger library compared to the SNES at release.&#91;68&#93; Nintendo's dollar share of the U.S. 16-bit market dropped from 60% at the end of 1992 to 37% at the end of 1993,&#91;69&#93; Sega claimed 55% of all 16-bit hardware sales during 1994,&#91;70&#93; and the SNES outsold the Genesis from 1995 through 1997.&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93;
In 1990, Sega launched the Game Gear, a handheld console, to compete against Nintendo's Game Boy. The Game Gear was designed as a portable version of the Master System and featured a full-color screen, in contrast to the monochrome Game Boy screen.&#91;74&#93;  Due to its short battery life, lack of original games, and weak support from Sega, the Game Gear did not surpass the Game Boy, having sold approximately 11 ;million units.&#91;75&#93;  Sega launched the Mega-CD in Japan on December 1, 1991, initially retailing at JP¥49,800.&#91;76&#93;  The add-on uses CD-ROM technology. Further features include a second, faster processor, vastly expanded system memory, a graphics chip that performed scaling and rotation similar to Sega's arcade games, and another sound chip.&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93; In North America, it was renamed the Sega CD and launched on October 15, 1992, with a retail price of US$299.&#91;77&#93; It was released in Europe as the Mega-CD in 1993.&#91;76&#93;  The Mega-CD sold only 100,000 units during its first year in Japan, falling well below expectations.&#91;76&#93; Sega did have success with arcade games; in 1992 and 1993, the new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased in-house development studio Sega AM2's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter (the first 3D fighting game), which played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics.&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93;
In 1993, the American media began to focus on the mature content of certain video games, such as Night Trap for the Sega CD and the Genesis version of Midway's Mortal Kombat.&#91;83&#93;&#91;84&#93; This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an "edgy" company with "attitude", and this reinforced that image.&#91;51&#93; To handle this, Sega instituted the United States' first video game ratings system, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC), for all its systems. Ratings ranged from the family-friendly GA rating to the more mature rating of MA-13, and the adults-only rating of MA-17.&#91;84&#93; Executive vice president of Nintendo of America Howard Lincoln was quick to point out in the United States congressional hearings in 1993 that Night Trap was not rated at all. Senator Joe Lieberman called for another hearing in February 1994 to check progress toward a rating system for video game violence.&#91;84&#93; After the hearings, Sega proposed the universal adoption of the VRC; after objections by Nintendo and others, Sega took a role in forming the Entertainment Software Rating Board.&#91;84&#93;
Sega began work on the Genesis' successor, the Sega Saturn, over two years before the system was showcased at the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994.&#91;85&#93; According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama became concerned about the 1994 release of the Atari Jaguar, and that the Saturn would not be available until the next year.  As a result, Nakayama decided to have a second console release to market by the end of 1994.  Sega began to develop the 32X, a Genesis add-on which would serve as a less expensive entry into the 32-bit era.&#91;86&#93; The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but would play Genesis games.&#91;31&#93; Sega released the 32X on November 21, 1994, in North America, December 3, 1994, in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at less than half of the Saturn's launch price.&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93; After the holiday season, interest in the 32X rapidly declined.&#91;86&#93;&#91;89&#93;
Sega released the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994.&#91;90&#93; Virtua Fighter, a port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.&#91;91&#93;&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93; Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day,&#91;2&#93;&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93; and it was more popular than new competitor Sony's PlayStation in Japan.&#91;93&#93;&#91;95&#93;  In March 1995, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske announced that the Saturn would be released in the U.S. on "Saturnday" (Saturday) September 2, 1995.&#91;96&#93;&#91;97&#93; Sega of Japan mandated an early launch to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation.&#91;94&#93; At the first Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles on May 11, 1995, Kalinske revealed the release price and that Sega had shipped 30,000 Saturns to Toys "R" Us, Babbage's, Electronics Boutique, and Software Etc. for immediate release.&#91;96&#93;  The Saturn's release in Europe also came before the previously announced North American date, on July 8, 1995.&#91;98&#93;  Within two days of the PlayStation's American launch on September 9, 1995, the PlayStation sold more units than the Saturn had in the five months following its surprise launch.&#91;99&#93;&#91;100&#93; Within its first year, the PlayStation secured over 20 percent of the U.S. video game market.&#91;101&#93; The console's high price point, surprise launch causing issues with distributors and third-party developers, and difficulty handling polygonal graphics were factors in its lack of success.&#91;102&#93; Sega also underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis; sales of 16-bit games and consoles accounted for 64 percent of the market in 1995.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93; Despite capturing 43 percent of the dollar share of the U.S. market and selling more than 2 ;million Genesis units in 1995, Kalinske estimated that Sega could have sold another 300,000 consoles if it had been prepared for demand.&#91;105&#93;
Sega announced that Shoichiro Irimajiri had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America in July 1996, while Kalinske left Sega after September 30 of that year.&#91;106&#93;&#91;107&#93; A former Honda executive,&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93; Irimajiri had been involved with Sega of America since joining Sega in 1993.&#91;106&#93;&#91;110&#93; The company also announced that Rosen and Nakayama had resigned from their positions at Sega of America, though both remained with Sega.&#91;106&#93;&#91;111&#93; Bernie Stolar, a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America,&#91;112&#93;&#91;113&#93; became Sega of America's executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party relations.&#91;106&#93;&#91;107&#93; Stolar was not supportive of the Saturn, believing its hardware was poorly designed.&#91;2&#93; While Stolar had stated that "the Saturn is not our future" at E3 1997, he continued to emphasize the quality of its games,&#91;2&#93; and later reflected that "we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer".&#91;113&#93; At Sony, Stolar had opposed the localization of certain Japanese PlayStation games that he felt would not represent the system well in North America. He advocated a similar policy for the Saturn, although he later sought to distance himself from this stance.&#91;2&#93;&#91;114&#93;&#91;115&#93; Other changes included a softer image in Sega's advertising, including removing the "Sega!" scream, and holding press events for the education industry.&#91;116&#93;
Sega partnered with GE to develop the Model 2 arcade system board, building onto 3D technology in the arcade industry at the time. This led to several successful arcade games, including Daytona USA, launched in a limited capacity in late 1993 and worldwide in 1994. Other popular games included Virtua Cop, and Virtua Fighter 2.&#91;117&#93; Aside from the Saturn, Sega made forays in the PC market with the 1995 establishment of SegaSoft, which was tasked with creating original Saturn and PC games.&#91;118&#93;&#91;119&#93; In 1996, Sega operated in-door theme parks not only in Japan with Joypolis, but also overseas, with Sega World branded arcades in the UK and Australia.&#91;120&#93;&#91;121&#93; From 1994 to 1999, Sega participated in the pinball market when it took over Data East's pinball division.&#91;122&#93;
In January 1997, Sega announced its intentions to merge with the Japanese toymaker Bandai. The merger, planned as a $1 ;billion stock swap whereby Sega would wholly acquire Bandai, was set to form a company known as Sega Bandai, Ltd.&#91;123&#93;&#91;124&#93; Though it was to be finalized in October of that year, it was called off in May after growing opposition from Bandai's midlevel executives. Bandai instead agreed to a business alliance with Sega.&#91;125&#93; As a result of Sega's deteriorating financial situation, Nakayama resigned as Sega president in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri.&#91;108&#93; Nakayama's resignation may have in part been due to the failure of the merger, as well as Sega's 1997 performance.&#91;126&#93; Stolar became CEO and president of Sega of America.&#91;113&#93;&#91;127&#93;
The Saturn failed to take the lead in the market. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and its games fell sharply,&#91;113&#93; while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn three-to-one in the U.S. in 1997.&#91;101&#93;  Following five years of declining profits,&#91;128&#93; in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as both a parent company and a corporation as a whole.&#91;129&#93; Shortly before the announcement of the losses, Sega discontinued the Saturn in North America to prepare for the launch of its successor, the Dreamcast.&#91;108&#93;&#91;113&#93; The decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year.&#91;130&#93; The Saturn lasted longer in Japan and Europe,&#91;109&#93; Irimajiri telling Japanese newspaper Daily Yomiuri that Saturn development would stop at the end of 1998 and games would continue to be produced until mid-1999.&#91;131&#93; Sega suffered a further ¥42.881 ;billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce.&#91;132&#93;&#91;133&#93;  With lifetime sales of 9.26 ;million units,&#91;134&#93; the Saturn is considered a commercial failure.&#91;135&#93; Sega's arcade divisions also struggled in the late 1990s, partly due to a market slump following competition from home consoles.&#91;136&#93;
Despite a 75 percent drop in half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders.&#91;137&#93; Sega announced that Sonic Adventure, the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, would be a Dreamcast launch game. It was promoted with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall.&#91;138&#93;&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93; Due to a high failure rate in the manufacturing process, Sega could not ship enough consoles for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch.&#91;137&#93;&#91;141&#93; As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan.&#91;142&#93;  Before the launch, Sega announced the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade system board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3.&#91;143&#93; NAOMI shared technology with the Dreamcast, allowing nearly identical ports of arcade games.&#91;130&#93;&#91;144&#93;
The Dreamcast launched in Japan on November 27, 1998. The entire stock of 150,000 consoles sold out by the end of the day.&#91;142&#93; Irimajiri estimated that another 200,000 to 300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply.&#91;142&#93; He hoped to sell over 1 ;million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold.  The low sales undermined Sega's attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers.&#91;145&#93; Before the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast in Japan by JP¥9,100, effectively making it unprofitable but increasing sales.&#91;137&#93;
On August 11, 1999, Sega of America confirmed that Stolar had been fired.&#91;146&#93; Peter Moore, whom Stolar had hired as a Sega of America executive only six months before,&#91;147&#93; was placed in charge of the North American launch.&#91;146&#93;&#91;148&#93;&#91;149&#93;&#91;150&#93; The Dreamcast launched in North America on September 9, 1999,&#91;130&#93;&#91;145&#93;&#91;151&#93; with 18 games.&#91;151&#93;&#91;152&#93;&#91;153&#93; Sega set a record by selling more than 225,132 Dreamcast units in 24 hours, earning $98.4 ;million in what Moore called "the biggest 24 hours in entertainment retail history".&#91;147&#93; Within two weeks, U.S. Dreamcast sales exceeded 500,000.&#91;147&#93; By Christmas, Sega held 31 percent of the U.S. video game market by revenue.&#91;154&#93; On November 4, Sega announced it had sold over one million Dreamcast units.&#91;155&#93; Nevertheless, the launch was marred by a glitch at one of Sega's manufacturing plants, which produced defective GD-ROMs where data was not properly burned onto the disc.&#91;156&#93;  Sega released the Dreamcast in Europe on October 14, 1999.&#91;155&#93; While Sega sold 500,000 units in Europe by Christmas 1999,&#91;137&#93; sales there slowed, and by October 2000 Sega had sold only about 1 ;million units.&#91;157&#93;
Though the Dreamcast's launch was successful, Sony's PlayStation still held 60 percent of the overall market share in North America at the end of 1999.&#91;155&#93; On March 2, 1999, in what one report called a "highly publicized, vaporware-like announcement",&#91;158&#93; Sony revealed the first details of its "next-generation PlayStation".&#91;159&#93;&#91;160&#93; The same year, Nintendo announced that its next console would meet or exceed anything on the market, and Microsoft began development of its own console, the Xbox.&#91;161&#93;&#91;162&#93;&#91;163&#93;  Sega's initial momentum proved fleeting as U.S. Dreamcast sales—which exceeded 1.5 ;million by the end of 1999&#91;164&#93;—began to decline as early as January 2000.&#91;165&#93; Poor Japanese sales contributed to Sega's ¥42.88 ;billion ($404 ;million) consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 2000. This followed a similar loss of ¥42.881 ;billion the previous year and marked Sega's third consecutive annual loss.&#91;132&#93;&#91;166&#93; Sega's overall sales for the term increased 27.4 percent, and Dreamcast sales in North America and Europe greatly exceeded its expectations. However, this coincided with a decrease in profitability due to the investments required to launch the Dreamcast in Western markets and poor software sales in Japan.&#91;132&#93; At the same time, worsening conditions reduced the profitability of Sega's Japanese arcade business, prompting the closure of 246 locations.&#91;132&#93;&#91;167&#93;
Moore stated that the Dreamcast would need to sell 5 ;million units in the U.S. by the end of 2000 to remain viable, but Sega fell short of this goal with some 3 ;million units sold.&#91;154&#93;&#91;168&#93; Moreover, Sega's attempts to spur Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses.&#91;169&#93; In March 2001, Sega posted a consolidated net loss of ¥51.7 ;billion ($417.5 ;million).&#91;170&#93; While the PlayStation 2's October 26 U.S. launch was marred by shortages, this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected, as many disappointed consumers continued to wait or purchased a PSone.&#91;154&#93;&#91;171&#93;&#91;172&#93; Eventually, Sony and Nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of the U.S. video game market respectively, while Sega held only 15 percent.&#91;137&#93;
CSK chairman Isao Okawa replaced Irimajiri as president of Sega on May 22, 2000.&#91;175&#93; Okawa had long advocated that Sega abandon the console business.&#91;176&#93; Others shared this view; Sega co-founder David Rosen had "always felt it was a bit of a folly for them to be limiting their potential to Sega hardware", and Stolar had suggested that Sega should have sold the company to Microsoft.&#91;2&#93;&#91;177&#93; In a September 2000 meeting with Sega's Japanese executives and heads of its first-party game studios, Moore and Sega of America executive Charles Bellfield recommended that Sega abandon its console business.  In response, the studio heads walked out.&#91;147&#93; Sega announced an official company name change from Sega Enterprises, Ltd. to Sega Corporation effective November 1, 2000.  Sega stated in a release that this was to display its commitment to its "network entertainment business".&#91;178&#93;
On January 23, 2001, Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shinbun reported that Sega would cease production of the Dreamcast and develop software for other platforms.&#91;179&#93; After an initial denial, Sega of Japan released a press release confirming it was considering producing software for the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance as part of its "new management policy".&#91;180&#93; On January 31, 2001, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March 31 and the restructuring of the company as a "platform-agnostic" third-party developer.&#91;181&#93;&#91;182&#93; Sega also announced a Dreamcast price reduction to eliminate its unsold inventory, estimated at 930,000 units as of April 2001.&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93; This was followed by further reductions to clear the remaining inventory.&#91;185&#93;&#91;186&#93; The final manufactured Dreamcast was autographed by the heads of all nine of Sega's first-party game studios, plus the heads of sports game developer Visual Concepts and audio studio Wave Master, and given away with 55 first-party Dreamcast games through a competition organized by GamePro.&#91;187&#93;
Okawa, who had loaned Sega $500 ;million in 1999, died on March 16, 2001. Shortly before his death, he forgave Sega's debts to him and returned his $695 ;million worth of Sega and CSK stock, helping the company survive the third-party transition.&#91;188&#93;&#91;189&#93;&#91;190&#93; He held failed talks with Microsoft about a sale or merger with their Xbox division.&#91;191&#93; According to former Microsoft executive Joachim Kempin, Microsoft founder Bill Gates decided against acquiring Sega because "he didn't think that Sega had enough muscle to eventually stop Sony".&#91;192&#93; As part of the restructuring, nearly one third of Sega's Tokyo workforce was laid off in 2001.&#91;193&#93; 2002 was Sega's fifth consecutive fiscal year of net losses.&#91;194&#93;  After Okawa's death, Hideki Sato, a 30-year Sega veteran who had worked on Sega's consoles, became company president. Following poor sales in 2002, Sega cut its profit forecast for 2003 by 90 percent, and explored opportunities for mergers. In 2003, Sega began talks with Sammy Corporation–a pachinko and pachislot manufacturing company–and video game company Namco. The president of Sammy, Hajime Satomi, had a history with Sega, as he was mentored by Isao Okawa and was previously asked to be CEO of Sega.&#91;195&#93; On February 13, Sega announced that it would merge with Sammy but, as late as April 17, Sega was still in talks with Namco, which was attempting to overturn the merger. Sega's consideration of Namco's offer upset Sammy executives. The day after Sega announced it was no longer planning to merge with Sammy, Namco withdrew its offer.&#91;196&#93; In 2003, Sato and COO Tetsu Kamaya stepped down, Sato being replaced by Hisao Oguchi, the head of the Sega studio Hitmaker.&#91;197&#93;
After the decline of the global arcade industry around the 21st century, Sega introduced several novel concepts tailored to the Japanese market. Derby Owners Club was an arcade machine with memory cards for data storage, designed to take over half an hour to complete and costing JP¥500 to play. Testing of Derby Owners Club in an arcade in Chicago showed that it became the most popular machine in the arcade, with a 92% replay rate. While the eight-player Japanese version of the game was released in 1999, the game was reduced to a smaller four-player version due to size issues and released in North America in 2003.&#91;198&#93; Sega introduced trading card game machines, with games such as World Club Champion Football for general audiences and Mushiking: The King of Beetles for young children. The company also introduced internet functionality in arcades with Virtua Fighter 4 in 2001, and further enhanced it with ALL.Net, a network system for arcade games, introduced in 2004.&#91;199&#93;
In August 2003, Sammy bought 22.4 percent of Sega's shares from CSK, making Sammy into Sega's largest shareholder.&#91;200&#93;&#91;201&#93;  In the same year, Hajime Satomi  stated that Sega's activity would focus on its profitable arcade business as opposed to loss-incurring home software development.&#91;202&#93; In 2004, Sega Sammy Holdings, an entertainment conglomerate, was created; Sega and Sammy became subsidiaries of the new holding company, both companies operating independently while the executive departments merged.  According to the first Sega Sammy Annual Report, the merger went ahead as both companies were facing difficulties. Satomi stated that Sega had been operating at a loss for nearly 10 years,&#91;203&#93; while Sammy feared stagnation and overreliance of its highly profitable pachislot and pachinko machine business and wanted to diversify.&#91;46&#93;  Sammy acquired the remaining percentages of Sega, completing a takeover.&#91;204&#93; The stock swap deal valued Sega between $1.45 ;billion and $1.8 ;billion.&#91;203&#93;&#91;205&#93;  Sega Sammy Holdings was structured into four parts: Consumer Business (video games), Amusement Machine Business (arcade games), Amusement Center Business (Sega's theme parks and arcades) and Pachislot and Pachinko Business (Sammy's pachinko and pachislot business).&#91;206&#93;
In the console and handheld business, Sega found success with games targeted at the Japanese market such as the Yakuza and Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series while also distributing games from smaller Japanese game developers and localizations of Western games in Japan.&#91;207&#93;&#91;208&#93; Sega's most successful arcade games at the time, such as Sangokushi Taisen and Border Break, continued to be based on network and card systems. Arcade machine sales incurred higher profits than the company's console, mobile and PC games on a year-to-year basis until the fiscal year of 2014.&#91;209&#93; In 2004, the GameWorks chain of arcades came under Sega ownership, until it was sold in 2011. In 2009, Sega Republic, an indoor theme park, opened in Dubai. The next year, Sega began providing the 3D imaging for Hatsune Miku's holographic concerts.&#91;210&#93; In 2013, Index Corporation was purchased by Sega Sammy after going bankrupt.&#91;211&#93; After the buyout, Sega implemented a corporate spin-off with Index. The latter's game assets were rebranded as Atlus, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sega.&#91;212&#93;
Due in part to the decline of packaged game sales worldwide in the 2010s,&#91;213&#93; Sega began layoffs and closed five offices based in Europe and Australia on July 1, 2012.&#91;214&#93; This was to focus on the digital game market, such as PC and mobile devices.&#91;215&#93;&#91;216&#93; Strong performers for Sega on these platforms include Phantasy Star Online 2 and Chain Chronicle.&#91;217&#93; Sega gradually reduced its arcade centers from 450 in 2005&#91;218&#93; to around 200 in 2015.&#91;219&#93; In the mobile market, Sega released its first app on the iTunes Store with a version of Super Monkey Ball in 2008. The Western lineup consisted of emulations of games and pay-to-play apps. These were eventually overshadowed by free-to-play games, leading to 19 older mobile games being pulled due to quality concerns in May 2015.&#91;220&#93;&#91;221&#93; In 2012, Sega also began acquiring studios for mobile development, studios such as Hardlight, Three Rings Design, and Demiurge Studios becoming fully owned subsidiaries.&#91;222&#93;&#91;223&#93;&#91;224&#93;
To streamline operations, Sega established operational firms for each of its businesses in the 2010s. In 2012, Sega established Sega Networks as a subsidiary company for its mobile games.&#91;225&#93;  The same year, Sega Entertainment was established for Sega's amusement facility business.&#91;226&#93; In January 2015, Sega of America announced its relocation from San Francisco to Atlus USA's headquarters in Irvine, California, which was completed later that year.&#91;227&#93; From 2005 to 2015, Sega's operating income generally saw improvements compared to Sega's past financial problems, but was not profitable every year.&#91;228&#93;
Sega Sammy Holdings announced in April 2017 that it would relocate its head office functions and domestic subsidiaries located in the Tokyo metropolitan area to Shinagawa-ku by January 2018. This was to consolidate scattered head office functions including Sega Sammy Holdings, Sammy Corporation, Sega Holdings, Sega Games, Atlus, Sammy Network, and Dartslive.&#91;234&#93;  Sega's previous headquarters in Ōta was sold in 2019 and will likely be torn down.&#91;235&#93; In June 2018, Gary Dale, formerly of Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, replaced Chris Bergstresser as president and COO of Sega Europe.&#91;236&#93;  A few months later, Ian Curran, a former executive at THQ and Acclaim Entertainment, replaced John Cheng as president and COO of Sega of America in August 2018.&#91;237&#93; In October 2018, Sega reported favorable western sales results from games such as Yakuza 6 and Persona 5, due to the localization work of Atlus USA.&#91;238&#93;
Despite a 35 percent increase in the sale of console games and success in its PC game business, profits fell 70 percent for the 2018 fiscal year in comparison to the previous year, mainly due to the digital games market which includes mobile games as well as Phantasy Star Online 2. In response, Sega announced that for its digital games it would focus on releases for its existing intellectual property and also focus on growth areas such as packaged games in the overseas market. Sega blamed the loss on market miscalculations and having too many games under development. Projects in development at Sega included a new game in the Yakuza series, Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers, the Sonic the Hedgehog film, and the Sega Genesis Mini,&#91;239&#93;&#91;240&#93; which was released in September 2019.&#91;241&#93; In May 2019, Sega acquired Two Point Studios, known for its positively reviewed Two Point Hospital.&#91;242&#93;&#91;243&#93;
On April 1, 2020, Sega Interactive merged with Sega Games Co., Ltd.  The company was again renamed Sega Corporation, while Sega Holdings Co., Ltd. was renamed Sega Group Corporation.&#91;244&#93; According to a company statement, the move was made to allow greater research and development flexibility.&#91;245&#93; In April 2020, Sega sold Demiurge Studios to Demiurge co-founder Albert Reed. Demiurge said it would continue to support the mobile games it developed under Sega.&#91;246&#93;
Sega's headquarters is in Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan.  Sega also has offices in Irvine, California (as Sega of America), in London (as Sega Europe),&#91;247&#93; in Seoul, South Korea as Sega Publishing Korea,&#91;248&#93; and in Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Taipei.&#91;249&#93;  In other regions, Sega has contracted distributors for its games and consoles, such as Tectoy in Brazil.&#91;32&#93;  Sega has had offices in France, Germany, Spain, and Australia;&#91;214&#93; those markets have since contracted distributors.&#91;250&#93;
Relations between the regional offices have not always been smooth.&#91;251&#93;  Some conflict in the 1990s may have been caused by Sega president Nakayama and his admiration for Sega of America; according to Kalinske, "There were some guys in the executive suites who really didn't like that Nakayama in particular appeared to favor the U.S. executives. A lot of the Japanese executives were maybe a little jealous, and I think some of that played into the decisions that were made."&#91;2&#93; By contrast, author Steven L. Kent stated that Nakayama bullied American executives and that Nakayama believed the Japanese executives made the best decisions. Kent also stated that Sega of American CEOs Kalinske, Stolar, and Moore dreaded meeting with Sega of Japan executives.&#91;252&#93;
Sega Toys Co., Ltd. has created toys for children's franchises such as Oshare Majo: Love and Berry, Mushiking: King of the Beetles, Lilpri, Bakugan, Jewelpet, Rilu Rilu Fairilu, Dinosaur King and Hero Bank. Products released in the West include the Homestar and the iDog. Sega Toys also inherited the Sega Pico handheld system and produced Pico software.&#91;253&#93;  Sega has operations of bowling alleys and arcades through its Sega Entertainment Co., Ltd. subsidiary.&#91;231&#93;  Since its first arcade opened in Japan in 1970, Sega has maintained a presence in operating arcades there, but has not been consistently successful in other territories.&#91;254&#93;  Its DartsLive subsidiary creates electronic darts games,&#91;249&#93; while Sega Logistics Service distributes and repairs arcade games.&#91;231&#93;  In 2015, Sega and Japanese advertising agency Hakuhodo formed a joint venture, Stories LLC, to create entertainment for film and TV. Stories LLC has exclusive licensing rights to adapt Sega properties into film and television,&#91;255&#93;&#91;256&#93; and has partnered with producers to develop series based on properties including Shinobi, Golden Axe, Virtua Fighter, The House of the Dead, and Crazy Taxi.&#91;257&#93;
As a games publisher, Sega produces games through its research and development teams. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, maintained through Sega's Sonic Team division, is one of the best-selling franchises in the history of video games.&#91;258&#93; Sega has also acquired third-party studios that are now owned by the company, including Amplitude Studios,&#91;259&#93; Atlus,&#91;212&#93; Creative Assembly,&#91;260&#93; Hardlight,&#91;224&#93; Relic Entertainment,&#91;261&#93; Sports Interactive,&#91;262&#93; and Two Point Studios.&#91;242&#93;&#91;243&#93;
Sega's software research and development teams began with one development division operating under Sega's longtime head of R&amp;D, Hisashi Suzuki. As the market increased for home video game consoles, Sega expanded with three Consumer Development (CS) divisions. After October 1983, arcade development expanded to three teams: Sega DD No. 1, 2, and 3. Some time after the release of Power Drift, the company restructured its teams again as the Sega Amusement Machine Research and Development Teams, or AM teams. Each arcade division was segregated, and a rivalry existed between the arcade and consumer development divisions.&#91;263&#93; In what has been called "a brief moment of remarkable creativity",&#91;130&#93; in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company's top designers.&#91;2&#93;&#91;151&#93;&#91;264&#93; The studios were United Game Artists, Smilebit, Hitmaker, Sega Rosso, Sega Wow, Overworks, Amusement Vision, Sega AM2, and Sonic Team.&#91;130&#93;&#91;265&#93; Sega's design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process.&#91;266&#93; After taking over as company president in 2003, Hisao Oguchi announced his intention to consolidate Sega's studios.&#91;197&#93; Prior to the acquisition by Sammy, Sega began the process of re-integrating its subsidiaries into the main company.&#91;267&#93;
Sega still operates first-party studios as departments of its research and development division. Sonic Team exists as Sega's CS2 research and development department,&#91;268&#93; while Sega's CS3 department has developed games such as Phantasy Star Online 2,&#91;269&#93; and Sega Interactive's AM2 department has more recently worked on projects such as smartphone game Soul Reverse Zero.&#91;270&#93; Toshihiro Nagoshi, formerly the head of Amusement Vision, remains involved with research and development as Sega's chief creative officer while working on the Yakuza series.&#91;271&#93;
Sega is the world's most prolific arcade game producer, having developed more than 500 games, 70 franchises, and 20 arcade system boards since 1981. It has been recognized by Guinness World Records for this achievement.&#91;272&#93; Of Sega's arcade division, Eurogamer's Martin Robinson said, "It's boisterous, broad and with a neat sense of showmanship running through its range. On top of that, it has something that's often evaded its console-dwelling cousin: success."&#91;273&#93;
The Sega Genesis is often ranked among the best consoles in history.&#91;274&#93;&#91;275&#93;&#91;276&#93;  In 2014, USgamer's Jeremy Parish credited it for galvanizing the market by breaking Nintendo's near-monopoly, helping create modern sports game franchises, and popularizing television games in the UK.&#91;277&#93; Kalinske felt Sega had innovated by developing games for an older demographic and pioneering the "street date" concept with the simultaneous North American and European release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.&#91;278&#93; Sega of America's marketing campaign for the Genesis influenced marketing for later consoles.&#91;279&#93;
Despite its commercial failure, the Saturn is well regarded for its library,&#91;98&#93;&#91;280&#93;&#91;281&#93; though it has been criticized for a lack of high-profile franchise releases.&#91;2&#93; Edge wrote that "hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like Burning Rangers, Guardian Heroes, Dragon Force and Panzer Dragoon Saga".&#91;282&#93; Sega's management was criticized for its handling of the Saturn.&#91;2&#93;&#91;98&#93; According to Greg Sewart of 1Up.com, "the Saturn will go down in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time".&#91;280&#93;
The Dreamcast is remembered for being ahead of its time,&#91;283&#93;&#91;284&#93;&#91;285&#93; with several concepts that became standard in consoles, such as motion controls and online functionality.&#91;286&#93; Its demise has been connected with transitions in the video game industry. In 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Duncan Harris wrote that the Dreamcast's end "signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture ;... Sega's console gave hope that things were not about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games."&#91;287&#93; Parish contrasted the Dreamcast's diverse library with the "suffocating sense of conservatism" that pervaded the industry in the following decade.&#91;288&#93;
In Eurogamer, Damien McFerran wrote that Sega's decisions in the late 1990s were "a tragic spectacle of overconfidence and woefully misguided business practice".&#91;51&#93;  Travis Fahs of IGN noted that since the Sammy takeover Sega had developed fewer games and outsourced to more western studios, and that its arcade operations had been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, he wrote: "Sega was one of the most active, creative, and productive developers the industry has ever known, and nothing that can happen to their name since will change that."&#91;2&#93; In 2015, Sega president Haruki Satomi told Famitsu that, in the previous ten years, Sega had "betrayed" the trust of older fans and that he hoped to re-establish the Sega brand.&#91;289&#93; During the promotion of the Sega Genesis Mini, Sega executive manager Hiroyuki Miyazaki reflected on Sega's history, saying, "I feel like Sega has never been the champion, at the top of all the video game companies, but I feel like a lot of people love Sega because of the underdog image."&#91;290&#93; In his 2018 book The Sega Arcade Revolution, Horowitz connected Sega's decline in the arcades after 1995 with broader industry changes. He argued that its most serious problems came from the loss of its creative talent, particularly Yuji Naka and Yu Suzuki, after the Sammy takeover, but concluded that "as of this writing, Sega is in its best financial shape of the past two decades. The company has endured."&#91;291&#93;

Video game development is the process of developing a video game. The effort is undertaken by a developer, ranging from a single person to an international team dispersed across the globe. Development of traditional commercial PC and console games is normally funded by a publisher, and can take several years to reach completion. Indie games usually take less time and money and can be produced by individuals and smaller developers. The independent game industry has been on the rise, facilitated by the growth of accessible game development software such as Unity platform and Unreal Engine&#91;1&#93; and new online distribution systems such as Steam and Uplay, as well as the mobile game market for Android and iOS devices.
The first video games, developed in the 1960s, were not usually commercialised. They required mainframe computers to run and were not available to the general public. Commercial game development began in the '70s with the advent of first-generation video game consoles and early home computers like the Apple I. At that time, owing to low costs and low capabilities of computers, a lone programmer could develop a full and complete game. However, in the late '80s and '90s, ever-increasing computer processing power and heightened expectations from gamers made it difficult for a single person to produce a mainstream console or PC game. The average cost of producing a triple-A video game slowly rose, from US$1–4 ;million in 2000, to over $5 ;million in 2006, then to over $20 ;million by 2010&#91;citation needed&#93;.
Mainstream commercial PC and console games are generally developed in phases: first, in pre-production, pitches, prototypes, and game design documents are written; if the idea is approved and the developer receives funding, then full-scale development begins. The development of a complete game usually involves a team of 20–100 individuals with various responsibilities, including designers, artists, programmers, and testers.
Games are produced through the software development process.&#91;2&#93; Games are developed as a creative outlet&#91;3&#93; and to generate profit.&#91;4&#93; Development is normally funded by a publisher.&#91;5&#93; Well-made games bring profit more readily.&#91;6&#93; However, it is important to estimate a game's financial requirements,&#91;7&#93; such as development costs of individual features.&#91;8&#93; Failing to provide clear implications of game's expectations may result in exceeding allocated budget.&#91;7&#93; In fact, the majority of commercial games do not produce profit.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; Most developers cannot afford changing their development schedule mid-way, and require estimating their capabilities with available resources before production.&#91;12&#93;
The game industry requires innovations, as publishers cannot profit from constant release of repetitive sequels and imitations.&#91;13&#93;&#91;neutrality&#32;is disputed&#93; Every year new independent development companies open and some manage to develop hit titles. Similarly, many developers close down because they cannot find a publishing contract or their production is not profitable.&#91;14&#93; It is difficult to start a new company due to high initial investment required.&#91;15&#93; Nevertheless, growth of casual and mobile game market has allowed developers with smaller teams to enter the market. Once the companies become financially stable, they may expand to develop larger games.&#91;14&#93; Most developers start small and gradually expand their business.&#91;15&#93;  A developer receiving profit from a successful title may store up capital to expand and re-factor their company, as well as tolerate more failed deadlines.&#91;16&#93;
An average development budget for a multiplatform game is US$18-28M, with high-profile games often exceeding $40M.&#91;17&#93;
In the early era of home computers and video game consoles in the early 1980s, a single programmer could handle almost all the tasks of developing a game — programming, graphical design, sound effects, etc.&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; It could take as little as six weeks to develop a game.&#91;19&#93; However, the high user expectations and requirements&#91;19&#93; of modern commercial games far exceed the capabilities of a single developer and require the splitting of responsibilities.&#91;21&#93; A team of over a hundred people can be employed full-time for a single project.&#91;20&#93;
Game development, production, or design is a process that starts from an idea or concept.&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; Often the idea is based on a modification of an existing game concept.&#91;22&#93;&#91;26&#93; The game idea may fall within one or several genres.&#91;27&#93; Designers often experiment with different combinations of genres.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; A game designer generally writes an initial game proposal document, that describes the basic concept, gameplay, feature list, setting and story, target audience, requirements and schedule, and finally staff and budget estimates.&#91;29&#93; Different companies have different formal procedures and philosophies regarding game design and development.&#91;30&#93;&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; There is no standardized development method; however commonalities exist.&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93;
A game developer may range from a single individual to a large multinational company. There are both independent and publisher-owned studios.&#91;33&#93; Independent developers rely on financial support from a game publisher.&#91;34&#93; They usually have to develop a game from concept to prototype without external funding. The formal game proposal is then submitted to publishers, who may finance the game development from several months to years. The publisher would retain exclusive rights to distribute and market the game and would often own the intellectual property rights for the game franchise.&#91;33&#93; Publisher's company may also own the developer's company,&#91;33&#93;&#91;35&#93; or it may have internal development studio(s). Generally the publisher is the one who owns the game's intellectual property rights.&#91;10&#93;
All but the smallest developer companies work on several titles at once. This is necessary because of the time taken between shipping a game and receiving royalty payments, which may be between 6 and 18 months. Small companies may structure contracts, ask for advances on royalties, use shareware distribution, employ part-time workers and use other methods to meet payroll demands.&#91;36&#93;
Console manufacturers, such as Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony, have a standard set of technical requirements that a game must conform to in order to be approved. Additionally, the game concept must be approved by the manufacturer, who may refuse to approve certain titles.&#91;37&#93;
Most modern PC or console games take from three to five years to complete.&#91;citation needed&#93;, where as a mobile game can be developed in a few months.&#91;38&#93; The length of development is influenced by a number of factors, such as genre, scale, development platform and number of assets.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Some games can take much longer than the average time frame to complete. An infamous example is 3D Realms' Duke Nukem Forever, announced to be in production in April 1997 and released fourteen years later in June 2011.&#91;39&#93; Planning for Maxis' game Spore began in late 1999; the game was released nine years later in September 2008.&#91;citation needed&#93; The game Prey was briefly profiled in a 1997 issue of PC Gamer, but was not released until 2006, and only then in highly altered form. Finally, Team Fortress 2 was in development from 1998 until its 2007 release, and emerged from a convoluted development process involving "probably three or four different games", according to Gabe Newell.&#91;40&#93;
The game revenue from retails is divided among the parties along the distribution chain, such as — developer, publisher, retail, manufacturer and console royalty. Many developers fail to profit from this and go bankrupt.&#91;36&#93; Many developers seek alternative economic models through Internet marketing and distribution channels to improve returns.,&#91;41&#93; as through a mobile distribution channel the share of a developer can be up to 70% of the total revenue &#91;38&#93; and through an online distribution channel almost 100%.
The history of game making begins with the development of the first video games, although which video game is the first depends on the definition of video game. The first games created had little entertainment value, and their development focus was separate from user experience—in fact, these games required mainframe computers to play them.&#91;42&#93; OXO, written by Alexander S. Douglas in 1952, was the first computer game to use a digital display.&#91;21&#93;  In 1958, a game called Tennis for Two, which displayed its output on an oscilloscope, was made by Willy Higinbotham, a physicist working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93;  In 1961, a mainframe computer game called Spacewar! was developed by a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students led by Steve Russell.&#91;43&#93;
True commercial design and development of games began in the 1970s, when arcade video games and first-generation consoles were marketed. In 1971, Computer Space was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of 74 series TTL chips.&#91;45&#93; In 1972, the first home console system was released called Magnavox Odyssey, developed by Ralph H. Baer.&#91;46&#93; That same year, Atari released Pong, an arcade game that increased video game popularity.&#91;47&#93; The commercial success of Pong led other companies to develop Pong clones, spawning the video game industry.&#91;48&#93;
Programmers worked within the big companies to produce games for these devices. The industry did not see huge innovation in game design and a large number of consoles had very similar games.&#91;49&#93; Many of these early games were often Pong clones.&#91;50&#93; Some games were different, however, such as Gun Fight, which was significant for several reasons:&#91;51&#93; an early 1975 on-foot, multi-directional shooter,&#91;52&#93; which depicted game characters,&#91;53&#93; game violence, and human-to-human combat.&#91;54&#93; Tomohiro Nishikado's original version was based on discrete logic,&#91;55&#93; which Dave Nutting adapted using the Intel 8080, making it the first video game to use a microprocessor.&#91;56&#93; Console manufacturers soon started to produce consoles that were able to play independently developed games,&#91;57&#93; and ran on microprocessors, marking the beginning of second-generation consoles, beginning with the release of the Fairchild Channel F in 1976.
The flood of Pong clones led to the video game crash of 1977, which eventually came to an end with the mainstream success of Taito's 1978 arcade shooter game Space Invaders,&#91;50&#93; marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market.&#91;50&#93;&#91;58&#93; Its creator Nishikado not only designed and programmed the game, but also did the artwork, engineered the arcade hardware, and put together a microcomputer from scratch.&#91;59&#93; It was soon ported to the Atari 2600, becoming the first "killer app" and quadrupling the console's sales.&#91;60&#93; At the same time, home computers appeared on the market, allowing individual programmers and hobbyists to develop games. This allowed hardware manufacturer and software manufacturers to act separately. A very large number of games could be produced by an individual, as games were easy to make because graphical and memory limitation did not allow for much content. Larger companies developed, who focused selected teams to work on a title.&#91;61&#93; The developers of many early home video games, such as Zork, Baseball, Air Warrior, and Adventure, later transitioned their work as products of the early video game industry.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The industry expanded significantly at the time, with the arcade video game sector alone (representing the largest share of the gaming industry) generating higher revenues than both pop music and Hollywood films combined.&#91;63&#93; The home video game industry, however, suffered major losses following the North American video game crash of 1983.&#91;64&#93; In 1984 Jon Freeman warned in Computer Gaming World:
Chris Crawford and Don Daglow in 1987 similarly advised prospective designers to write games as a hobby first, and to not quit their existing jobs early.&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93; The home video game industry was revitalized soon after by the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System.&#91;67&#93;
Compute!'s Gazette in 1986 stated that although individuals developed most early video games, "It's impossible for one person to have the multiple talents necessary to create a good game".&#91;68&#93; By 1987 a video game required 12 months to develop and another six to plan marketing. Projects remained usually solo efforts, with single developers delivering finished games to their publishers.&#91;66&#93; With the ever-increasing processing and graphical capabilities of arcade, console and computer products, along with an increase in user expectations, game design moved beyond the scope of a single developer to produce a marketable game.&#91;69&#93; The Gazette stated, "The process of writing a game involves coming up with an original, entertaining concept, having the skill to bring it to fruition through good, efficient programming, and also being a fairly respectable artist".&#91;68&#93; This sparked the beginning of team-based development.&#91;citation needed&#93; In broad terms, during the 1980s, pre-production involved sketches and test routines of the only developer. In the 1990s, pre-production consisted mostly of game art previews. In the early 2000s, pre-production usually produced a playable demo.&#91;70&#93;
In 2000 a 12 to 36 month development project was funded by a publisher for US$1M–3M.&#91;71&#93; Additionally, $250k–1.5M were spent on marketing and sales development.&#91;72&#93; In 2001, over 3000 games were released for PC; and from about 100 games turning profit only about 50 made significant profit.&#91;71&#93; In the early 2000s it became increasingly common to use middleware game engines, such as Quake engine or Unreal engine.&#91;73&#93;
In the early 2000s, also mobile games started to gain popularity. However, mobile games distributed by mobile operators remained a marginal form of gaming until the Apple App Store was launched in 2008.&#91;38&#93;
In 2005, a mainstream console video game cost from US$3M to $6M to develop. Some games cost as much as $20M to develop.&#91;74&#93; In 2006 the profit from a console game sold at retail was divided among parties of distribution chain as follows: developer (13%), publisher (32%), retail (32%), manufacturer (5%), console royalty (18%).&#91;36&#93; In 2008 a developer would retain around 17% of retail price and around 85% if sold online.&#91;10&#93;
Since the third generation of consoles, the home video game industry has constantly increased and expanded. The industry revenue has increased at least five-fold since the 1990s. In 2007, the software portion of video game revenue was $9.5 ;billion, exceeding that of the movie industry.&#91;75&#93;
The Apple App Store, introduced in 2008, was the first mobile application store operated directly by the mobile platform holder. It significantly changed the consumer behaviour more favourable for downloading mobile content and quickly broadened the markets of mobile games.&#91;38&#93;
In 2009 games' market annual value was estimated between $7–30 ;billion, depending on which sales figures are included. This is on par with films' box office market.&#91;76&#93; A publisher would typically fund an independent developer for $500k–$5M for a development of a title.&#91;33&#93; In 2012, the total value had already reached $66.3 ;billion and by then the video game markets were no longer dominated by console games. According to Newzoo, the share of MMO's was 19.8%, PC/MAC's 9.8%, tablets' 3.2%, smartphones 10.6%, handhelds' 9.8%, consoles' only 36.7% and online casual games 10.2%. The fastest growing market segments being mobile games with an average annual rate of 19% for smartphones and 48% for tablets.&#91;77&#93;
In the past several years, many developers opened and many closed down. Each year a number of developers are acquired by larger companies or merge with existing companies. For example, in 2007 Blizzard Entertainment's parent company, Vivendi Games merged with Activision. In 2008 Electronic Arts nearly acquired Take-Two Interactive. In 2009 Midway Games was acquired by Time-Warner and Eidos Interactive merged with Square Enix.&#91;78&#93;
Development is overseen by internal and external producers.&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93; The producer working for the developer is known as the internal producer and manages the development team, schedules, reports progress, hires and assigns staff, and so on.&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93; The producer working for the publisher is known as the external producer and oversees developer progress and budget.&#91;82&#93; Producer's responsibilities include PR, contract negotiation, liaising between the staff and stakeholders, schedule and budget maintenance, quality assurance, beta test management, and localization.&#91;80&#93;&#91;83&#93; This role may also be referred to as project manager, project lead, or director.&#91;80&#93;&#91;83&#93;
A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally or have had developed by an external video game developer. As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their product's manufacturing and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising.
They usually finance the development, sometimes by paying a video game developer (the publisher calls this external development) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers called a studio. Consequently, they also typically own the IP of the game.&#91;38&#93; Large video game publishers also distribute the games they publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish.
Other functions usually performed by the publisher include deciding on and paying for any license that the game may utilize; paying for localization; layout, printing, and possibly the writing of the user manual; and the creation of graphic design elements such as the box design.
Large publishers may also attempt to boost efficiency across all internal and external development teams by providing services such as sound design and code packages for commonly needed functionality.
Because the publisher usually finances development, it usually tries to manage development risk with a staff of producers or project managers to monitor the progress of the developer, critique ongoing development, and assist as necessary. Most video games created by an external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties. These advances are paid when the developer reaches certain stages of development, called milestones.
Independent video game developers create games without a publisher and may choose to digitally distribute their games.
Developers can range in size from small groups making casual games to housing hundreds of employees and producing several large titles. &#91;15&#93; Companies divide their subtasks of game's development. Individual job titles may vary; however, roles are the same within the industry.&#91;30&#93; The development team consists of several members.&#91;21&#93; Some members of the team may handle more than one role; similarly more than one task may be handled by the same member.&#91;30&#93; Team size can vary from 20 to 100 or more members, depending on the game's scope. The most represented are artists, followed by programmers, then designers, and finally, audio specialists, with two to three producers in management. These positions are employed full-time. Other positions, such as testers, may be employed only part-time.&#91;84&#93; Salaries for these positions vary depending on both the experience and the location of the employee. An entry-level programmer can make, on average, around $70,000 annually and an experienced programmer can make, on average, around $125,000 annually.&#91;85&#93;
A development team includes these roles or disciplines:&#91;30&#93;
A game designer is a person who designs gameplay, conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game.&#91;86&#93;&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93; Development teams usually have a lead designer who coordinates the work of other designers. They are the main visionary of the game.&#91;89&#93; One of the roles of a designer is being a writer, often employed part-time to conceive game's narrative, dialogue, commentary, cutscene narrative, journals, video game packaging content, hint system, etc.&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93;&#91;92&#93; In larger projects, there are often separate designers for various parts of the game, such as, game mechanics, user interface, characters, dialogue, graphics, etc.
A game artist is a visual artist who creates video game art.&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93; The art production is usually overseen by an art director or art lead, making sure their vision is followed. The art director manages the art team, scheduling and coordinating within the development team.&#91;93&#93;
The artist's job may be 2D oriented or 3D oriented. 2D artists may produce concept art,&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93; sprites,&#91;97&#93; textures,&#91;98&#93;&#91;99&#93; environmental backdrops or terrain images,&#91;95&#93;&#91;99&#93; and user interface.&#91;97&#93; 3D artists may produce models or meshes,&#91;100&#93;&#91;101&#93; animation,&#91;100&#93; 3D environment,&#91;102&#93; and cinematics.&#91;102&#93; Artists sometimes occupy both roles.
A game programmer is a software engineer who primarily develops video games or related software (such as game development tools). The game's codebase development is handled by programmers.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93; There are usually one to several lead programmers,&#91;105&#93; who implement the game's starting codebase and overview future development and programmer allocation on individual modules.
Individual programming disciplines roles include:&#91;103&#93;
A level designer is a person who creates levels, challenges or missions for computer and/or video games using a specific set of programs.&#91;106&#93;&#91;107&#93; These programs may be commonly available commercial 3D or 2D design programs, or specially designed and tailored level editors made for a specific game.
Level designers work with both incomplete and complete versions of the game. Game programmers usually produce level editors and design tools for the designers to use. This eliminates the need for designers to access or modify game code. Level editors may involve custom high-level scripting languages for interactive environments or AIs. As opposed to the level editing tools sometimes available to the community, level designers often work with placeholders and prototypes aiming for consistency and clear layout before required artwork is completed.
Sound engineers are technical professionals responsible for sound effects and sound positioning. They sometimes oversee voice acting and other sound asset creation.&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93; Composers who create a game's musical score also comprise a game's sound team, though often this work is outsourced.
The quality assurance is carried out by game testers. A game tester analyzes video games to document software defects as part of a quality control. Testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise, and analytic competence.&#91;99&#93;&#91;110&#93;
The testers ensure that the game falls within the proposed design: it both works and is entertaining.&#91;111&#93;This involves testing of all features, compatibility, localization, etc. Although, necessary throughout the whole development process, testing is expensive and is often actively utilized only towards the completion of the project.
Game development is a software development process, as a video game is software with art, audio, and gameplay. Formal software development methods are often overlooked.&#91;2&#93; Games with poor development methodology are likely to run over budget and time estimates, as well as contain a large number of bugs. Planning is important for individual&#91;9&#93; and group projects alike.&#91;71&#93;
Overall game development is not suited for typical software life cycle methods, such as the waterfall model.&#91;112&#93;
One method employed for game development is agile development.&#91;113&#93; It is based on iterative prototyping, a subset of software prototyping.&#91;114&#93; Agile development depends on feedback and refinement of game's iterations with gradually increasing feature set.&#91;115&#93; This method is effective because most projects do not start with a clear requirement outline.&#91;113&#93; A popular method of agile software development is Scrum.&#91;116&#93;
Another successful method is Personal Software Process (PSP) requiring additional training for staff to increase awareness of project's planning.&#91;117&#93; This method is more expensive and requires commitment of team members. PSP can be extended to Team Software Process, where the whole team is self-directing.&#91;118&#93;
Game development usually involves an overlap of these methods.&#91;112&#93; For example, asset creation may be done via waterfall model, because requirements and specification are clear, &#91;119&#93; but gameplay design might be done using iterative prototyping.&#91;119&#93;
Development of a commercial game usually includes the following stages:&#91;120&#93;&#91;121&#93;
Pre-production&#91;122&#93; or design phase&#91;70&#93; is a planning phase of the project focused on idea and concept development and production of initial design documents.&#91;121&#93;&#91;123&#93;&#91;124&#93;&#91;125&#93; The goal of concept development is to produce clear and easy to understand documentation,&#91;121&#93;&#91;126&#93; which describes all the tasks, schedules and estimates for the development team.&#91;127&#93; The suite of documents produced in this phase is called production plan.&#91;128&#93; This phase is usually not funded by a publisher,&#91;121&#93; however good publishers may require developers to produce plans during pre-production.&#91;127&#93;
The concept documentation can be separated into three stages or documents—high concept, pitch and concept;&#91;120&#93;&#91;129&#93; however, there is no industry standard naming convention, for example, both Bethke (2003) and Bates (2004) refer to pitch document as "game proposal",&#91;122&#93;&#91;127&#93; yet Moore, Novak (2010) refers to concept document as "game proposal".&#91;120&#93;
The late stage of pre-production may also be referred to as proof of concept,&#91;122&#93; or technical review&#91;120&#93; when more detailed game documents are produced.
Publishers have started to expect broader game proposals even featuring playable prototypes.&#91;130&#93;
High concept is a brief description of a game.&#91;120&#93;&#91;122&#93; The high concept is the one-or two-sentence response to the question, "What is your game about?".
A pitch,&#91;120&#93;&#91;122&#93; concept document,&#91;120&#93; proposal document,&#91;127&#93; or game proposal&#91;122&#93; is a short summary document intended to present the game's selling points and detail why the game would be profitable to develop.&#91;120&#93;&#91;122&#93;
Verbal pitches may be made to management within the developer company, and then presented to publishers.&#91;131&#93; A written document may need to be shown to publishers before funding is approved.&#91;127&#93; A game proposal may undergo one to several green-light meetings with publisher executives who determine if the game is to be developed.&#91;132&#93; The presentation of the project is often given by the game designers.&#91;citation needed&#93; Demos may be created for the pitch; however may be unnecessary for established developers with good track records.&#91;citation needed&#93;
If the developer acts as its own publisher, or both companies are subsidiaries of a single company, then only the upper management needs to give approval.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Concept document,&#91;122&#93; game proposal,&#91;120&#93; or game plan&#91;133&#93; is a more detailed document than the pitch document.&#91;120&#93;&#91;122&#93;&#91;126&#93; This includes all the information produced about the game.&#91;133&#93; This includes the high concept, game's genre, gameplay description, features, setting, story, target audience, hardware platforms, estimated schedule, marketing analysis, team requirements, and risk analysis.&#91;134&#93;
Before an approved design is completed, a skeleton crew of programmers and artists usually begins work.&#91;citation needed&#93;  Programmers may develop quick-and-dirty prototypes showcasing one or more features that stakeholders would like to see incorporated in the final product.&#91;citation needed&#93;  Artists may develop concept art and asset sketches as a springboard for developing real game assets.&#91;citation needed&#93;  Producers may work part-time on the game at this point, scaling up for full-time commitment as development progresses.&#91;citation needed&#93; Game producers work during pre-production is related to planning the schedule, budget and estimating tasks with the team.&#91;citation needed&#93; The producer aims to create a solid production plan so that no delays are experienced at the start of the production.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Before a full-scale production can begin, the development team produces the first version of a game design document incorporating all or most of the material from the initial pitch.&#91;135&#93;&#91;136&#93; The design document describes the game's concept and major gameplay elements in detail. It may also include preliminary sketches of various aspects of the game. The design document is sometimes accompanied by functional prototypes of some sections of the game.&#91;citation needed&#93; The design document remains a living document throughout the development—often changed weekly or even daily.&#91;137&#93;
Compiling a list of game's needs is called "requirement capture".&#91;9&#93;
Writing prototypes of gameplay ideas and features is an important activity that allows programmers and game designers to experiment with different algorithms and usability scenarios for a game. A great deal of prototyping may take place during pre-production before the design document is complete and may, in fact, help determine what features the design specifies. Prototyping at this stage is often done manually, (paper prototyping), not digitally&#91;citation needed&#93;, as this is often easier and faster to test and make changes before wasting time and resources into what could be a canceled idea or project. Prototyping may also take place during active development to test new ideas as the game emerges.
Prototypes are often meant only to act as a proof of concept or to test ideas, by adding, modifying or removing some of the features.&#91;138&#93; Most algorithms and features debuted in a prototype may be ported to the game once they have been completed.
Often prototypes need to be developed quickly with very little time for up-front design (around 15 to 20 minutes of testing)&#91;citation needed&#93;. Therefore, usually very prolific programmers are called upon to quickly code these testbed tools. RAD tools may be used to aid in the quick development of these programs. In case the prototype is in a physical form, programmers and designers alike will make the game with paper, dice, and other easy to access tools in order to make the prototype faster.
A successful development model is iterative prototyping, where design is refined based on current progress. There are various technology available for video game development&#91;139&#93;
Production is the main stage of development, when assets and source code for the game are produced.&#91;140&#93;
Mainstream production is usually defined as the period of time when the project is fully staffed.&#91;citation needed&#93;  Programmers write new source code, artists develop game assets, such as, sprites or 3D models. Sound engineers develop sound effects and composers develop music for the game. Level designers create levels, and writers write dialogue for cutscenes and NPCs.&#91;original research?&#93;  Game designers continue to develop the game's design throughout production.
Game design is an essential and collaborative&#91;141&#93; process of designing the content and rules of a game,&#91;142&#93; requiring artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills.&#91;143&#93; Creativity and an open mind is vital for the completion of a successful video game.
During development, the game designer implements and modifies the game design to reflect the current vision of the game. Features and levels are often removed or added. The art treatment may evolve and the backstory may change. A new platform may be targeted as well as a new demographic. All these changes need to be documented and disseminated to the rest of the team. Most changes occur as updates to the design document.
The programming of the game is handled by one or more game programmers. They develop prototypes to test ideas, many of which may never make it into the final game.  The programmers incorporate new features demanded by the game design and fix any bugs introduced during the development process. Even if an off-the-shelf game engine is used, a great deal of programming is required to customize almost every game.
From a time standpoint, the game's first level takes the longest to develop.   As level designers and artists use the tools for level building, they request features and changes to the in-house tools that allow for quicker and higher quality development. Newly introduced features may cause old levels to become obsolete, so the levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed and discarded. Because of the dynamic environment of game development, the design of early levels may also change over time. It is not uncommon to spend upwards of twelve months on one level of a game developed over the course of three years. Later levels can be developed much more quickly as the feature set is more complete and the game vision is clearer and more stable.
Game audio may be separated into three categories—sound effects, music, and voice-over.&#91;144&#93;
Sound effect production is the production of sounds by either tweaking a sample to a desired effect or replicating it with real objects.&#91;144&#93; Sound effects are important and impact the game's delivery.&#91;145&#93;
Music may be synthesized or performed live.&#91;146&#93;
There are several ways in which music is presented in a game.
A game title with 20 hours of single-player gameplay may feature around 60 minutes of music.&#91;148&#93;
Voice-overs and voice acting creates character gameplay interactivity.&#91;144&#93; Voice acting adds personality to the game's characters.&#91;149&#93;
At the end&#91;original research?&#93; of the project, quality assurance plays a significant role.  Testers start work once anything is playable. This may be one level or subset of the game software that can be used to any reasonable extent. Early on, testing a game occupies a relatively small amount of time. Testers may work on several games at once. As development draws to a close, a single game usually employs many testers full-time (and often with overtime). They strive to test new features and regression test existing ones. Testing is vital for modern, complex games as single changes may lead to catastrophic consequences.
At this time features and levels are being finished at the highest rate and there is more new material to be tested than during any other time in the project. Testers need to carry out regression testing to make sure that features that have been in place for months still operate correctly.   Regression testing is one of the vital tasks required for effective software development. As new features are added, subtle changes to the codebase can produce unexpected changes in different portions of the game. This task is often overlooked, for several reasons. Sometimes, when a feature is implemented and tested, it is considered "working" for the rest of the project and little attention is given to repeated testing. Also, features that are added late in development are prioritized and existing features often receive insufficient testing time. Proper regression testing is also increasingly expensive as the number of features increases and is often not scheduled correctly.
Despite the dangers of overlooking regression testing, some game developers and publishers fail to test the full feature suite of the game and ship a game with bugs. This can result in customers dissatisfaction and failure to meet sales goals. When this does happen, most developers and publishers quickly release patches that fix the bugs and make the game fully playable again.
Commercial game development projects may be required to meet milestones set by publisher. Milestones mark major events during game development and are used to track game's progress.&#91;150&#93; Such milestones may be, for example, first playable,&#91;151&#93;&#91;152&#93; alpha,&#91;153&#93;&#91;154&#93; or beta&#91;154&#93;  game versions. Project milestones depend on the developer schedules.&#91;150&#93;
Milestones are usually based on multiple short descriptions for functionality; examples may be "Player roaming around in game environment" or "Physics working, collisions, vehicle" etc. (numerous descriptions are possible).  These milestones are usually how the developer gets paid; sometimes as "an advance against royalty". These milestones are listed, anywhere from three to twenty depending on developer and publisher.  The milestone list is usually a collaborative agreement between the publisher and developer.  The developer usually advocates for making the milestone descriptions as simple as possible; depending on the specific publisher - the milestone agreements may get very detailed for a specific game.  When working with a good publisher, the "spirit of the law" is usually adhered to regarding milestone completion... in other words if the milestone is 90% complete the milestone is usually paid with the understanding that it will be 100% complete by the next due milestone.  It is a collaborative agreement between publisher and developer, and usually (but not always) the developer is constrained by heavy monthly development expenses that need to be met.  Also, sometimes milestones are "swapped", the developer or publisher may mutually agree to amend the agreement and rearrange milestone goals depending on changing requirements and development resources available.  Milestone agreements are usually included as part of the legal development contracts.  After each "milestone" there is usually a payment arrangement.  Some very established developers may simply have a milestone agreement based on the amount of time the game is in development (monthly / quarterly) and not specific game functionality - this is not as common as detailed functionality "milestone lists".
There is no industry standard for defining milestones, and such vary depending on publisher, year, or project.&#91;155&#93; Some common milestones for two-year development cycle are as follows:&#91;150&#93;
The first playable is the game version containing representative gameplay and assets,&#91;150&#93; this is the first version with functional major gameplay elements.&#91;151&#93; It is often based on the prototype created in pre-production.&#91;152&#93; Alpha and first playable are sometimes used to refer to a single milestone, however large projects require first playable before feature complete alpha.&#91;151&#93; First playable occurs 12 to 18 months before code release.  It is sometimes referred to as the "Pre-Alpha" stage.&#91;154&#93;
Alpha is the stage when key gameplay functionality is implemented, and assets are partially finished.&#91;154&#93; A game in alpha is feature complete, that is, game is playable and contains all the major features.&#91;155&#93; These features may be further revised based on testing and feedback.&#91;154&#93; Additional small, new features may be added, similarly planned, but unimplemented features may be dropped.&#91;155&#93; Programmers focus mainly on finishing the codebase, rather than implementing additions.&#91;153&#93;  Alpha occurs eight to ten months before code release,&#91;154&#93; but this can vary significantly based on the scope of content and assets any given game has.
Code freeze is the stage when new code is no longer added to the game and only bugs are being corrected. Code freeze occurs three to four months before code release.&#91;154&#93;
Beta is feature and asset complete version of the game, when only bugs are being fixed.&#91;153&#93;&#91;154&#93; This version contains no bugs that prevent the game from being shippable.&#91;153&#93; No changes are made to the game features, assets, or code. Beta occurs two to three months before code release.&#91;154&#93;
Code release is the stage when many bugs are fixed and game is ready to be shipped or submitted for console manufacturer review. This version is tested against QA test plan. First code release candidate is usually ready three to four weeks before code release.&#91;154&#93;
Gold master is the final game's build that is used as a master for production of the game.&#91;156&#93;
In most AAA game development, games are announced a year or more and given a planned release date or approximate window so that they can promote and market the game, establish orders with retailers, and entice consumers to pre-order the game. Delaying the release of a video game can have negative financial impact for publishers and developers, and extensive delays may lead to project cancellation and employee layoffs.&#91;157&#93; To assure a game makes a set release date, publishers and developers may require their employees to work overtime to complete the game, which is considered common in the industry.&#91;158&#93; This overtime is often referred to it as "crunch time" or "crunch mode".&#91;159&#93; In 2004 and afterwards, the culture of crunch time in the industry came under scrutiny, leading to many publishers and developers to reduce the expectation on developers for overtime work and better schedule management, though crunch time still can occur.&#91;160&#93;
After the game goes gold and ships, some developers will give team members comp time (perhaps up to a week or two) to compensate for the overtime put in to complete the game, though this compensation is not standard.
Once a game ships, the maintenance phase for the video game begins.&#91;161&#93;
Games developed for video game consoles have had almost no maintenance period in the past. The shipped game would forever house as many bugs and features as when released. This was common for consoles since all consoles had identical or nearly identical hardware; making incompatibility, the cause of many bugs, a non-issue. In this case, maintenance would only occur in the case of a port, sequel, or enhanced remake that reuses a large portion of the engine and assets.
In recent times popularity of online console games has grown, and online capable video game consoles and online services such as Xbox Live for the Xbox have developed. Developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches. These changes would not have been possible in the past without the widespread availability of the Internet.
PC development is different. Game developers try to account for majority of configurations and hardware. However, the number of possible configurations of hardware and software inevitably leads to discovery of game-breaking circumstances that the programmers and testers didn't account for.
Programmers wait for a period to get as many bug reports as possible. Once the developer thinks they've obtained enough feedback, the programmers start working on a patch. The patch may take weeks or months to develop, but it's intended to fix most accounted bugs and problems with the game that were overlooked past code release, or in rare cases, fix unintended problems caused by previous patches. Occasionally a patch may include extra features or content or may even alter gameplay.
In the case of a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), such as a MMORPG or MMORTS, the shipment of the game is the starting phase of maintenance.&#91;161&#93; Such online games are in continuous maintenance as the gameworld is continuously changed and iterated and new features are added. The maintenance staff for a popular MMOG can number in the dozens, sometimes including members of the original programming team.
Several development disciplines, such as audio, dialogue, or motion capture, occur for relatively short periods of time. Efficient employment of these roles requires either large development house with multiple simultaneous title production or outsourcing from third-party vendors.&#91;162&#93; Employing personnel for these tasks full-time is expensive,&#91;163&#93; so a majority of developers outsource a portion of the work. Outsourcing plans are conceived during the pre-production stage; where the time and finances required for outsourced work are estimated.&#91;164&#93;
The game production has similar distribution methods to those of music and film industries.&#91;33&#93;
The publisher's marketing team targets the game for a specific market and then advertises it.&#91;172&#93; The team advises the developer on target demographics and market trends,&#91;172&#93; as well as suggests specific features.&#91;173&#93; The game is then advertised and the game's high concept is incorporated into the promotional material, ranging from magazine ads to TV spots.&#91;172&#93; Communication between developer and marketing is important.&#91;173&#93;
The length and purpose of a game demo depends on the purpose of the demo and target audience. A game's demo may range between a few seconds (such as clips or screenshots) to hours of gameplay. The demo is usually intended for journalists, buyers, trade shows, general public, or internal employees (who, for example, may need to familiarize with the game to promote it). Demos are produced with public relations, marketing and sales in mind, maximizing the presentation effectiveness.&#91;174&#93;
As a game nears completion, the publisher will want to showcase a demo of the title at trade shows. Many games have a "Trade Show demo" scheduled.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The major annual trade shows are, for example, Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) or Penny Arcade Expo (PAX).&#91;175&#93; E3 is the largest show in North America.&#91;176&#93; E3 is hosted primarily for marketing and business deals. New games and platforms are announced at E3 and it received broad press coverage.&#91;76&#93;&#91;177&#93; Thousands of products are on display and press demonstration schedules are kept.&#91;177&#93; In recent years E3 has become a more closed-door event and many advertisers have withdrawn, reducing E3's budget.&#91;76&#93; PAX, created by authors of Penny Arcade blog and web-comic, is a mature and playful event with a player-centred philosophy.&#91;33&#93;
A game created in one language may also be published in other countries which speak a different language. For that region, the developers may want to translate the game to make it more accessible. For example, some games created for PlayStation Vita were initially published in Japanese language, like Soul Sacrifice. Non-native speakers of the game's original language may have to wait for the translation of the game to their language. But most modern big-budget games take localization into account during the development process and the games are released in several different languages simultaneously.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Localization is the process of translating the language assets in a game into other languages.&#91;178&#93; By localizing games, they increase their level of accessibility where games could help to expend the international markets effectively. Game localization is generally known as language translations yet a "full localization" of a game is a complex project. Different levels of translation range from: zero translation being that there is no translation to the product and all things are sent raw, basic translation where only a few text and subtitles are translated or even added, and a full translation where new voice overs and game material changes are added.
There are various essential elements on localizing a game including translating the language of the game to adjusting in-game assets for different cultures to reach more potential consumers in other geographies (or globalization for short). Translation seems to fall into the scope of localization, which itself constitutes a substantially broader endeavor.&#91;179&#93; These include the different levels of translation to the globalization of the game itself. However, certain developers seem to be divided on whether globalization falls under localization or not.
Moreover, in order to fit into the local markets, game production companies often change or redesign the graphic designs or the packaging of the game for marketing purposes. For example, the popular game Assassin's Creed has two different packaging designs for the Japanese and US market.&#91;180&#93; By localizing the graphics and packaging designs, companies might arouse better connections and attention from the consumers from various regions.
Independent games or indie games&#91;181&#93; are produced by individuals and small teams with no large-scale developer or publisher affiliations.&#91;181&#93;&#91;182&#93;&#91;183&#93; Indie developers generally rely on Internet distribution schemes. Many hobbyist indie developers create mods of existing games. Indie developers are credited for creative game ideas (for example, Darwinia, Weird Worlds, World of Goo). Current economic viability of indie development is questionable, however in recent years internet delivery platforms, such as, Xbox Live Arcade and Steam have improved indie game success.&#91;181&#93; In fact, some indie games have become very successful, such as Braid,&#91;184&#93; World of Goo,&#91;185&#93; and Minecraft.&#91;186&#93; In recent years many communities have emerged in support of indie games such as the popular indie game marketplace Itch.io, indie game YouTube channels and a large indie community on Steam (service). It is common for indie game developers to release games for free and generate revenue through other means such as microtransactions (in-game transactions), in-game advertisements and crowd-funding services like Patreon and Kickstarter.
The video game industry (formally referred to as interactive entertainment) is the economic sector involved with the development, marketing and sale of video games. The industry sports several unique approaches.

Game development culture always has been and continues to be very casual by normal business standards. Many game developers are strongly individualistic and usually tolerant of divergent personalities. Despite the casual culture, game development is taken seriously by its practitioners, who may take offense if it is suggested that they don't have "a real job."&#91;citation needed&#93;
In the United States, in the early history of video game development, the prominent locale for game development was the corridor from San Francisco to Silicon Valley in California.&#91;187&#93; Most new developers in the US open near such "hot beds".&#91;14&#93;
At present, many large publishers still operate there, such as: Activision Blizzard, Capcom Entertainment, Disney Interactive, Eidos Interactive, Electronic Arts, Foundation 9, LucasArts Entertainment, Namco Bandai Games, Sega of America, Sony Computer Entertainment America, THQ. However, due to the nature of game development, many publishers are present in other regions, such as Big Fish Games (Washington), GarageGames (Oregon), Majesco Entertainment (New Jersey), Microsoft Corporation (Washington), Nintendo of America (Washington), Take-Two Interactive (New York), SouthPeak Games (Virginia).&#91;188&#93;
Many universities and design schools are offering classes specifically focused on game development.&#91;13&#93; Some have built strategic alliances with major game development companies.&#91;189&#93;&#91;190&#93; These alliances ensure that students have access to the latest technologies and are provided the opportunity to find jobs within the gaming industry once qualified.&#91;citation needed&#93; Many innovative ideas are presented at conferences, such as Independent Games Festival (IGF) or Game Developers Conference (GDC).
Indie game development may motivate students who produce a game for their final projects or thesis and may open their own game company.&#91;181&#93;
Universities offer Computer Science degrees which give you a strong basis of knowledge if you wish to become a programmer &#91;191&#93;
Video game industry employment is fairly volatile, similar to other artistic industries including television, music, etc. Scores of game development studios crop up, work on one game, and then quickly go under.&#91;192&#93; This may be one reason why game developers tend to congregate geographically; if their current studio goes under, developers can flock to an adjacent one or start another from the ground up.
In an industry where only the top 20% of products make a profit,&#91;193&#93; it's easy to understand this fluctuation. Numerous games may start development and are cancelled, or perhaps even completed but never published. Experienced game developers may work for years and yet never ship a title: such is the nature of the business. This volatility is likely inherent to the artistic nature of games.

Shinagawa (品川区, Shinagawa-ku) is a special ward in Tokyo, Japan. The ward refers to itself as Shinagawa City in English. The ward is home to ten embassies.
As of 1 ;April ;2016&#91;update&#93;, the ward has an estimated population of 380,293, and a population density of 16,510 persons per km². The total area is 22.84 ;km².&#91;1&#93;
Shinagawa is also commonly used to refer to the business district around Shinagawa Station, which is not part of the Shinagawa ward. This Shinagawa is in Takanawa and Konan neighborhoods of Minato, directly north of Kita-Shinagawa.
Shinagawa includes natural uplands and lowlands, as well as reclaimed land. The uplands are the eastern end of the Musashino Terrace. They include Shiba-Shirokanedai north of the Meguro River, Megurodai between the Meguro and Tachiai Rivers, and Ebaradai south of the Tachiai River.
The ward lies on Tokyo Bay. Its neighbors on land are all special wards of Tokyo: Kōtō to the east, Minato to the north, Meguro to the west, and Ōta to the south.
The ward of Shinagawa consists of five areas, each consisting of multiple districts and neighborhoods:
&#32;
&#32;
Most of Tokyo east of the Imperial Palace is reclaimed land. A large portion of reclamation happened during the Edo period. Following the Meiji Restoration and the Abolition of the han system, Shinagawa prefecture was instituted in 1869. The prefectural administration was planned to be set up in present-day Shinagawa in the Ebara District. In 1871, Shinagawa prefecture was integrated into Tokyo Prefecture.
The ward was founded on March 15, 1947, through the administrative amalgamation of the former Ebara Ward with the former Shinagawa Ward. Both Ebara Ward and Shinagawa Ward had been created in 1932, with the outward expansion of the municipal boundaries of the Tokyo City following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.
In the Edo period, Shinagawa-juku was the first shukuba (post town) in the "53 Stations of the Tōkaidō" a traveler would reach after setting out from Nihonbashi on the Tōkaidō highway from Edo to Kyoto. The post-town function is retained today with several large hotels near the train station offering 6,000 hotel rooms, the largest concentration in the city. The Tokugawa shogunate maintained the Suzugamori execution grounds in Shinagawa.
The Tōkaidō Shinkansen high-speed rail line began serving Shinagawa Station in 2003.
Shinagawa is run by a city assembly of 40 elected members. The mayor as of 2007 is Takeshi Hamano, an independent. Liberal Democratic Party together with New Komeito currently forms government.

Many companies are headquartered in Shinagawa. Isuzu, an auto manufacturer;&#91;11&#93; JTB Corporation, a major travel agency;&#91;12&#93; Nippon Light Metal, an aluminum and chemical products company;&#91;13&#93; MOS Burger (in the ThinkPark Tower, Ōsaki);&#91;14&#93; Lawson (East Tower of Gate City Ohsaki in Ōsaki),&#91;15&#93; Namco Bandai Holdings;&#91;16&#93; Namco Bandai Games;&#91;17&#93; Banpresto;&#91;18&#93; Rakuten,&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; Honda brand Acura;&#91;citation needed&#93; Toyo Seikan, a packaging manufacturer;&#91;21&#93; NSK Ltd., a bearing maker;&#91;22&#93; Fuji Electric, an electrical equipment manufacturer;&#91;23&#93;  Imagica, a media post-production company;&#91;24&#93;  Nippon Chemi-Con, an electronic components manufacturer;&#91;25&#93;  Topy Industries, a machinery and automotive components company;&#91;26&#93; Gakken, a publishing and educational serevices company;&#91;27&#93; Comsys, a telecommunications construction and engineering company;&#91;28&#93; and Pola Cosmetics&#91;29&#93; all have their headquarters within Shinagawa Ward. Marza Animation Planet also has its headquarters in Shinagawa on the 18th floor of the NYK Tennoz Building near Tennōzu Isle Station.&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; And recently, since January 2018, Sega, best known for its Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, also has its headquarters in Shinagawa at the Sumitomo Fudosan Osaki Garden Tower near Ōsaki Station.
Japan Airlines (JAL), the head office of its subsidiary JAL Hotels, and registered offices of JAL Express and JALways are located in the Tennōzu Isle area.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93;&#91;33&#93;&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; In addition, Jalux, a subsidiary, has its head office in the I·S Building.&#91;37&#93; One group of employees moved into the building on July 26, 2010, and one on August 2, 2010.&#91;38&#93;
Public elementary and junior high schools are operated by the Shinagawa Ward Board of Education. Public high schools are operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education.
Shinagawa Station is in fact located in neighboring Minato but also serves the northern part of Shinagawa, and is a stop on the high-speed Tōkaidō Shinkansen line.
Shinagawa is also home to the main motor vehicle registration facility for central Tokyo (located east of Samezu Station). As a result, many license plates in Tokyo are labeled with the name "Shinagawa."
Shinagawa has sister-city relationships with Auckland in New Zealand, Geneva in Switzerland, and Portland, Maine in the United States.&#91;70&#93;
Shinagawa has exchange city relationships with Harbin in People's Republic of China&#91;72&#93; and concludes "Hometown exchange agreement"(ふるさと交流協定) with Hayakawa and Yamakita towns.&#91;73&#93;

Periscope&#91;a&#93; is an electromechanical shooting gallery arcade game.  Two different companies independently developed and released the game:  Nakamura Manufacturing Co. (initially as Torpedo Launcher) and Sega Enterprises, Ltd.  Masaya Nakamura claims it to be the first arcade game he built, with his company claiming a release in Japan as early as 1965.  Sega's version of Periscope is the company's first produced arcade game, released in Japan in 1966.
Periscope popularized the US$0.25 cost per play of arcade games in the United States. Its success surprised Sega, leading to Sega's further manufacture of eight to ten new arcade games a year for the next few years. Periscope performed well in locations that would not have normally hosted coin-operated machines at the time, such as malls and department stores. The game's success has been referred to as a "turning point" in the industry.
Periscope is a shooting gallery game, simulating a submarine attacking warships.&#91;1&#93; It is designed with a backdrop representing the ocean, upon which cardboard cutouts of ships hanging from chains are moved horizontally.&#91;2&#93; Players look through a periscope to direct and fire torpedoes,&#91;2&#93; which are represented by lines of colored lights and by electronic sound effects.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;  Each play has five torpedoes that can be launched. One cabinet model supports up to three players and one supports one player.&#91;5&#93;
In a 1977 interview, Masaya Nakamura of Nakamura Manufacturing Co., later known as Namco, claimed that Periscope is the first amusement device that he built.&#91;6&#93;  Namco states that its Japanese release of the game was in 1965.&#91;7&#93;  Initially known as Torpedo Launcher,&#91;5&#93; the game is featured as Periscope in the April 1967 issue of Cashbox, with Nakamura offering direct import assistance to distributors.&#91;8&#93;  It has been speculated that the original version built by Namco may have been a custom model for department store rooftops, a year prior to the mass-produced model.  It has also been speculated that Namco may have licensed the game to Sega;&#91;5&#93; Nakamura stated that he did sell some of his games to competitors.&#91;6&#93;
According to former Sega CEO David Rosen, poor conditions in the US coin-op manufacturing market prompted the company's development of electromechanical games.  His company, Rosen Enterprises, had just merged with Nihon Goraku Bussan to form Sega Enterprises, Ltd. the previous year, and both companies had engineers on staff.&#91;2&#93; Rosen sketched out the design of Periscope personally.&#91;9&#93;  Released in 1966, Sega's original release of the game is a three-player cabinet.&#91;5&#93; Its original price per play of ¥30 is twice the price of earlier games.&#91;1&#93;  As the latest in the well-received genre of torpedo shooter games, Sega demonstrated it alongside such competition as slot machines, slot racing games, and pinball games at the 23rd London Amusement Trades Exhibition (A.T.E.) show in December&#91;10&#93; and at the Hotel Equipment Exhibition in Paris in October 1967.  The popular three-player cabinet drew in Fr500 (approximately US$100 then and equivalent to $811&#32;in 2019) per day at the Paris show, which was sparsely attended.&#91;11&#93;
At the time, Periscope&#39;s large cabinet was cost-prohibitive for international export, but its popularity among distributors flying in to see the game prompted Sega to develop a smaller model for the worldwide market.&#91;5&#93;
Prototype location testing of a new, smaller single-player version of Periscope occurred in Asia and Europe, and distributors were still enthusiastic about its performance, according to Rosen.&#91;12&#93;  In full production by March 1968 and distributed internationally,&#91;5&#93;&#91;12&#93; the smaller single-player cabinet measures 6 feet (1.8 ;m) deep and more than 4 feet (1.2 ;m) wide, which is still larger and heavier than most games of the time.  Furthermore, Japan's high export tax made it more expensive than most coin-op games at the time, costing distributors US$1,295 (equivalent to $10,506&#32;in 2019) per single-player cabinet while the average game cost $695-795.&#91;2&#93;&#91;5&#93;  Enthusiastic distributors complained of the expensive but popular machine's overall low profit, so Sega suggested charging a premium price of 25 cents per play (equivalent to $2&#32;in 2019).&#91;2&#93;&#91;5&#93;
Periscope became a surprise success for Sega.  It performed well in larger locations such as malls and department stores, which normally did not host coin-operated arcade games, but became a preferred location due to the machine's size and impracticality at a streetside location.&#91;5&#93;  As a result of Periscope&#39;s success, Sega created between eight and ten games a year for the next two years, and exported all of them.&#91;2&#93;&#91;5&#93;
The game was successful in Japan, and then in the US and Europe.&#91;3&#93;&#91;13&#93;  The game's success helped to set the trend of a  quarter dollar coin per play for premium games,&#91;5&#93; which became the US market standard for all arcade games since then.&#91;14&#93;  According to Rosen, "If you talk to the old timers in the industry, they will tell you that The Periscope was a turning point in the industry."&#91;2&#93;  He said Periscope showed Sega it "could design acceptable games" and prompted the company's business of designing and exporting original games,&#91;2&#93; including to the United States.&#91;15&#93;  Sega upgraded its subsequent game development to utilize the latest technology, with Rosen mentioning, "We were doing lots of things that hadn't been done before, like adding sound and special effects."&#91;4&#93; Periscope also sparked competition from traditional Chicago arcade manufacturers. The success of Periscope led to American distributors turning to Japan for new arcade games, which in turn encouraged competition from Chicago manufacturers.&#91;2&#93;  The game's periscope viewer cabinet design was later adopted by several arcade video games, including Midway's Sea Wolf (1976) and Atari's Battlezone (1980).&#91;16&#93;
Retrospectively, Ken Horowitz praised Periscope&#39;s impressive features for its time and points out its importance in Sega's history.  According to Horowitz, "Large, bulky, and loud, it was an amazing sight to behold for the first time.  Periscope attracted a great deal of attention from customers, but it also made waves with distributors, and it was incredibly successful for Sega.  It may not be widely discussed today, but most Sega fans are aware of Periscope and the role it played in Sega's history."&#91;5&#93;  Luke Plunkett of Kotaku stated that Periscope "set Sega on a path of electronic arcade gaming it's still on to this day".&#91;17&#93;  According to Eddie Adlum, publisher of RePlay, "People came into these arcades just to play that game.  I would say that in my time, Periscope is one of the great successful novelty machines."&#91;1&#93;

The SG-1000&#91;a&#93; is a home video game console manufactured by Sega and released in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions. It was Sega's first entry into the home video game hardware business. Introduced in 1983, the SG-1000 was released on the same day that Nintendo released the Family Computer in Japan. The SG-1000 was released in several forms, including the SC-3000 computer and the redesigned SG-1000 II&#91;b&#93; released in 1984. A third iteration of the console, the Sega Mark III, was released in 1985. It provided a custom video display processor over previous iterations and served as the basis for the Master System in 1986, Sega's first internationally released console.
Developed in response to a downturn in arcades in 1982, the SG-1000 was created on the advice of Hayao Nakayama, president of Sega Enterprises, Ltd. Shortly after the release, Sega Enterprises was sold to CSK Corporation, which was followed by the release of the SG-1000 II. The SC-3000 and the SG-1000 line both support a library of 76 ROM cartridge games and 29 Sega My Card games, all of which are fully compatible with the Mark III and the Japanese version of the Master System.
In the early 1980s, Sega Enterprises, Inc., then a subsidiary of Gulf and Western, was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues rose to $214 ;million.&#91;1&#93;  A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company, leading Gulf and Western to sell its North American arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;  The company retained Sega's North American R&amp;D operation, as well as its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd.  With its arcade business in decline, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. president Hayao Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise to move into the home console market in Japan, which was in its infancy at the time.&#91;4&#93;  Nakayama received permission to proceed.&#91;5&#93; The first model to be developed was the SC-3000, a computer with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.&#91;6&#93;  To keep costs down while ensuring sufficient longevity, Sega opted to create the platform from popular off-the-shelf components.&#91;6&#93;
The SG-1000 was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983, at JP¥15,000.&#91;7&#93; It was released on the same day as Nintendo launched the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan.&#91;5&#93;&#91;8&#93; It was released simultaneously with the SC-3000,&#91;5&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;9&#93; also known as the Sega Personal Computer SC-3000,&#91;10&#93; as well as the upgraded SC-3000H.&#91;11&#93; Though Sega themselves only released the SG-1000 in Japan, rebranded versions were released in several other markets worldwide.  Released at nearly the same time as the Japanese version, the SG-1000 was released in Australia through John Sands Electronics&#91;5&#93; and in New Zealand by Grandstand Leisure.&#91;6&#93;  The console also saw a release in Italy and Spain,&#91;12&#93; but was not released in the larger video game markets of the United States, United Kingdom, or Germany.&#91;8&#93; Despite this, an unauthorized clone system known as the Telegames Personal Arcade was produced and made available in the United States and Taiwan, and is able to play SG-1000 and ColecoVision games.&#91;5&#93;  An additional release of the SG-1000 in Taiwan was done by Aaronix.&#91;6&#93; The console enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Taiwan before the market was taken over by cheaper Famicom clones.&#91;13&#93;
Due in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.&#91;6&#93; Former Sega consumer hardware development head Hideki Sato stated that because Sega had not predicted the SG-1000 would sell so well, the company became more enamored with developing video game consoles.&#91;14&#93;  Despite this, the three launch games, all of which were ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name recognition of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye.&#91;6&#93;
Shortly after launch, Gulf and Western began to divest itself of its non-core businesses after the death of company founder Charles Bluhdorn,&#91;15&#93; so Nakayama and former Sega CEO David Rosen arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation, a prominent Japanese software company. Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises, Ltd.&#91;16&#93; Following the buyout, Sega released another console, the SG-1000 II, on July 31, 1984&#91;9&#93;&#91;12&#93; at JP¥15,000.&#91;17&#93; The SG-1000 II replaced the hardwired joystick with two detachable joypads.&#91;5&#93;  Sato disliked the original cartridges, saying they looked like "small black tombstones" when inserted in the console, and later remarked that his proudest achievement of the SG-1000 era was replacing them with the "cheerier", pocket-sized Sega My Cards.&#91;6&#93; Sega also employed popular owarai comedy duo Tunnels to provide celebrity endorsement for the console.&#91;6&#93;
By 1984, the Famicom's success began to outpace the SG-1000. The Famicom had more advanced hardware, allowing it to perform smoother scrolling and more colorful sprites, and Nintendo boosted its games library by courting third-party developers, whereas Sega was less than eager to collaborate with the same companies they were competing with in arcades.&#91;6&#93; The SG-1000 was also coming up against game consoles from companies including Tomy and Bandai.&#91;5&#93; This would result in the release of the Sega Mark III in Japan in 1985, which later became the Master System worldwide.&#91;12&#93; The last cartridge released was Portrait of Loretta on February 18, 1987.&#91;18&#93;  In 2006, the GameTap subscription gaming service added an emulator of the SG-1000, and several playable titles.&#91;19&#93;
The SG-1000 is powered by an 8-bit Zilog Z80 central processing unit running at 3.58 ;MHz for the SG-1000 and SG-1000 II,&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93; and at 4 ;MHz for the SC-3000.&#91;22&#93;  Its video processor is a Texas Instruments TMS9928A, capable of displaying up to 16 colors, and its sound processor is a Texas Instruments SN76489.  All three chips were also used in the ColecoVision.&#91;5&#93;  The system includes 8 ;kbit (1 ;KB) of random access memory (RAM)&#91;20&#93;  The controller is hardwired to the system in the original model, and detachable in the SG-1000 II.  Video and audio output are supplied through an RF switch.&#91;5&#93;  Power is supplied through a 9 ;V DC connector connected to an AC adapter.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;
Several peripherals exist for the SG-1000 series.  Available at ¥13,800 at its time of release, the SK-1100 keyboard connects through the expansion slot and is compatible with all models.&#91;23&#93;  Multiple controllers were created, including the SJ-200 joystick attached to the SG-1000, and the SJ-150 joypad, made for use with the SG-1000 II.  A racing wheel known as the SH-400 was made for use with games such as Monaco GP.&#91;24&#93;  The C-1000 Card Catcher, sold at ¥1,000, allowing players to play Sega My Card titles.&#91;25&#93;  Additional accessories existed solely for use with the SC-3000, including the SR-1000 cassette deck,&#91;26&#93; the SP-400 4-color plotter printer,&#91;27&#93; and the SF-7000 expansion device which adds a floppy disk drive and additional memory.&#91;28&#93;
Sega's software library for the SG-1000 and SC-3000 comprises 42 game cartridges and 29 Sega My Card releases that required the Card Catcher add-on. There were also 26 educational and programming cartridges for the SC-3000 that could only be played on the SG-1000 with the SK-1100 keyboard peripheral.&#91;18&#93; Titles for the system include Flicky, Congo Bongo, Sega-Galaga, and Girl's Garden, the first video game programmed by Sonic the Hedgehog developer Yuji Naka.  The library included licensed titles, such as Golgo 13.  Packaging and game manuals came with both Japanese and English text until 1984, when manuals were switched to Japanese only and the size of the cartridge box was reduced.&#91;5&#93;  Hideki Sato stated that Sega lacked adequate staff to develop games for the console at the time.&#91;14&#93; SC-3000/SG-1000 games were continued to be produced after the launch of the Mark III in 1985. The last two SC-3000/SG-1000 cartridge games were The Castle in 1986 and Portrait of Loretta in 1987. The final Sega My Card game for the SC-3000/SG-1000 was The Black Onyx, also in 1987.&#91;29&#93;
The SG-1000 made little impact on the video game industry, but has been recognized for being Sega's first video game console. Retro Gamer writer Damien McFerran said it was an "abject failure", but called it and the SG-1000 II "the Japanese forefathers of the Master System".&#91;12&#93;  Writing for Wired, Chris Kohler criticized the poor response of the controller's joystick and the lack of an RCA output. He said the release timing hurt its success; "[al]though its graphics were of better quality than most consoles on the market, it had the bad luck to be released in the same month as Nintendo's world-changing Famicom, which had killer apps like Donkey Kong and could run circles around Sega's hardware."&#91;5&#93;  Of its legacy, Kohler said, "Few have heard of it, even fewer have played it, and the games weren't that great anyway."&#91;5&#93; By contrast, Luke Plunkett of Kotaku recognized that "while all this makes it sound like the SG-1000 was a bit of a misfire, it was still important in the development of Sega's home console business."&#91;8&#93;
Hideki Sato reflected positively on the innovations in the development of the SG-1000, but admitted that the console had limitations because of how new the market was and that Sega was inexperienced in developing for a video game console at the time.  According to Sato, "The problem was, while we knew how to make arcade games, we didn’t really know anything about console development. In fact, the very idea of a “consumer” market for video games was unheard of then: back then it was just a 'new business' idea."&#91;14&#93;

The Sega Master System (SMS)&#91;c&#93; is a third-generation 8-bit home video game console manufactured by Sega. It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III, the third iteration of the SG-1000 series of consoles, which was released in Japan in 1985 and featured enhanced graphical capabilities over its predecessors. The Master System launched in North America in 1986, followed by Europe in 1987, and Brazil in 1989. A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987, which features a few enhancements over the export models (and by proxy the original Mark III): a built-in FM audio chip, a rapid-fire switch, and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses. A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe.
The original Master System models use both cartridges and a credit card-sized format known as Sega Cards. Accessories for the consoles include a light gun and 3D glasses that work with a range of specially designed games. The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot, turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and is incompatible with the 3D glasses.
The Master System was released in competition with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Its library is smaller and with fewer well-reviewed games than the NES, due in part to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity. Though the Master System had newer, improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil.
Master System sales estimates are between 10 and 13 ;million units. Retrospective criticism has recognized its role in the development of the Sega Genesis, and a number of well received games, particularly in PAL (including PAL-M) regions, but is critical of its limited library in the NTSC regions, which were dominated by the Nintendo Entertainment System.
In the early 1980s, Sega Enterprises, Inc., then a subsidiary of the American conglomerate Gulf and Western, was one of the largest arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, with company revenues of $214 ;million by mid-1982.&#91;10&#93; A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 negatively impacted the company, leading Gulf and Western to sell the North American manufacturing and licensing of its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing.&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93; The company retained its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd., as well as Sega's North American research and development division. With its arcade business in decline, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. president Hayao Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise to move into the home console market in Japan, which was in its infancy at the time.&#91;13&#93; Nakayama received permission to proceed.&#91;14&#93; The first model to be developed was the SC-3000, a computer with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.&#91;15&#93;
The SG-1000 was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983, at a price of JP¥15,000.&#91;16&#93; It was launched on the same day that Nintendo released the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan.&#91;17&#93; Shortly after the launch of the SG-1000, Gulf and Western began to divest itself of its non-core businesses after the death of company founder, Charles Bluhdorn,&#91;18&#93; so Nakayama and former Sega CEO David Rosen arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation, a prominent Japanese software company. Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises, Ltd.&#91;19&#93; Following the buyout, Sega released another console, the SG-1000 II,&#91;20&#93; for ¥15,000.&#91;21&#93; It features a few hardware tweaks from the original model, including detachable controllers.&#91;17&#93; The SG-1000 II did not sell well, however, leading to Sega's decision to continue work on the video game hardware used for the system. This resulted in the release of the Sega Mark III in Japan in 1985.&#91;20&#93;
Engineered by the same internal Sega team that had created the SG-1000,&#91;22&#93; the Mark III is a redesigned iteration of the previous console.&#91;23&#93; The CPUs in the SG-1000 and SG-1000 II are Zilog Z80As running at 3.58 MHz,&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; while the Mark III, SC-3000—a computer version of the SG-1000—and Master System feature a Z80A running at 4 ;MHz.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; The Mark III and Master System also have a slot for Sega Card software without any need for the Card Catcher add-on that the SC-3000 and previous SG-1000 consoles required.
For the console's North America release, Sega restyled and rebranded the Mark III under the name "Master System", similar to Nintendo's own reworking of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System. The "Master System" name is one of several proposals Sega's American employees considered, and was ultimately chosen by throwing darts against a whiteboard, although plans to release a cheaper console similarly referred to as the "Base System" also influenced the decision. Sega Enterprises Chairman Isao Okawa endorsed the name after being told it was a reference to the competitive nature of both the video game industry and martial arts, in which only one competitor can be the "Master".&#91;29&#93; The futuristic final design for the Master System was intended to appeal to Western tastes.&#91;22&#93;  As part of the marketing for the release in North America, Sega of America head Bruce Lowry stated that the console's packaging was made white only because Nintendo's NES was packaged in black, and the grid design was inspired by its use in Apple Computer products.&#91;30&#93;
The Sega Mark III was released in Japan in October 1985 at a price of ¥15,000.&#91;2&#93; Though featuring technically more powerful hardware than its chief competition, the Famicom, the Mark III did not prove to be successful at its launch. Difficulties arose from Nintendo's licensing practices with third-party developers at the time, whereby Nintendo required that games for the Famicom not be published on other consoles. To overcome this, Sega developed its own games and obtained the rights to port games from other developers, but they did not sell well. NEC later used the same strategy on some of Sega's games when developing games for the TurboGrafx-16.&#91;20&#93; In preparation for the launch, Mark Cerny has stated that "pressure was very, very high", with a typical game being allotted only three months of development time.&#91;31&#93;
After being restyled the "Master System", the console was released in North America in 1986 at a price of $200 (equivalent to $466&#32;in 2019), including a multicart of the games Hang-On and Safari Hunt.&#91;32&#93; Sega and Nintendo, which was similarly exporting the Famicom to the US as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), planned to spend $15 ;million in the fall and winter of 1986 to market their consoles; Sega hoped to sell 400,000 to 750,000 consoles in 1986.&#91;33&#93; By the end of 1986, 125,000 Master System consoles had been sold, more than the Atari 7800's 100,000 but less than Nintendo's 1.1 ;million.&#91;1&#93; As in Japan, the Master System in North America had a limited game library that was not as well received as the NES. Against Nintendo's licensing practices, Sega only had two third-party American publishers, Activision and Parker Brothers.&#91;20&#93; By 1988, Nintendo commanded 83 percent of the North American video game market share.&#91;34&#93; Sega claimed that "our system is the first one where the graphics on the box are actually matched by the graphics of the game",&#91;33&#93; and marketing for the Master System was targeted at bringing home the arcade experience, but its marketing department was run by only two men, giving Sega a disadvantage in advertising.&#91;22&#93; At this time, Sega sold the distribution rights for the Master System in the United States to Tonka, which did not have any previous experience with electronic entertainment systems. Some of Tonka's decisions with the Master System included blocking localization of several popular video games.&#91;20&#93; Though the distributor of the console had changed, the Master System continued to perform poorly in the market.&#91;20&#93; The console was re-released as the Master System in Japan in October 1987 for ¥16,800,&#91;4&#93; but still sold poorly as did the Mark III.&#91;20&#93; Neither model posed a serious challenge to Nintendo in Japan.&#91;7&#93;
The European launch of the Master System occurred in 1987. It was distributed by Mastertronic in the United Kingdom, Master Games in France, and Ariolasoft in Germany.&#91;35&#93;  Mastertronic advertised the Master System as "an arcade in the home" and launched the system at £99 (equivalent to £281&#32;in 2019). Advance orders from retailers were high, but Sega proved unable to deliver inventory until Boxing Day on December 26, causing many retailers to cancel their orders. As a result, Master Games and Mastertronic both entered financial crises and Ariolasoft vowed never to work with Sega again. Mastertronic had already sold a minority interest to Richard Branson and the Virgin group to enter the console business and now sold the remainder of the company to avoid bankruptcy. The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic then took over all European distribution in 1988.&#91;35&#93; Virgin Mastertronic consequently focused marketing the Master System on ports of Sega's arcade games and positioning it as a superior video game alternative to the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum home computers. As a result of this marketing and of Nintendo's less effective approaches in Europe, the Master System began to attract European-based developers.&#91;36&#93; The Master System held a significant part of the video game console market in Europe through the release of Sega's succeeding console, the Mega Drive.&#91;20&#93;&#91;36&#93;
Brazil was also a successful market for the Master System, where the console was distributed by Tectoy.&#91;20&#93;&#91;36&#93; Launched officially in Brazil in September 1989, the Master System achieved success in the region.&#91;37&#93; By the end of 1990, the Master System installed base in Brazil was about 280,000 units.&#91;38&#93; The company also introduced a telephone service with tips for games, created a Master System club, and presented the program Master Tips during commercial breaks of the television show Sessão Aventura of Rede Globo.&#91;37&#93;  Sega's primary competition, Nintendo, did not officially arrive in Brazil until 1993,&#91;39&#93; and were unable to compete.&#91;40&#93; Tectoy claimed 80% of the Brazilian video game market.&#91;41&#93;
Sega released the Mega Drive, a 16-bit video game console, in Japan on October 29, 1988.&#91;42&#93; The final licensed release for the Mark III/Master System in Japan was Bomber Raid in 1989.&#91;20&#93; During the same year, Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive, relabeled "Genesis", in North America. Displeased with Tonka's handling of the Master System, Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System for the United States. In 1990, Sega released the remodeled Master System II, designed to be a lower-cost version of the console without the Sega Card slot.&#91;20&#93;&#91;32&#93; Sega promoted the new model itself, but the console still sold poorly in the region though Tonka was no longer involved with the Master System's marketing.&#91;20&#93; By early 1992, Master System production ceased in North America. By the time of its discontinuation, between 1.5 ;million and 2 ;million units had been sold in the United States,&#91;8&#93;&#91;43&#93; finishing behind both Nintendo and Atari, which controlled 80 percent and 12 percent of the market, respectively.&#91;44&#93; The last licensed release in North America was Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991.&#91;20&#93;
Contrary to its performance in Japan and North America, the Master System was eventually a success in Europe, where it outsold the NES by a considerable margin.&#91;9&#93;&#91;45&#93; As late as 1993, the Master System's active installed user base in Europe was 6.25 ;million units, larger than that of the Mega Drive's 5.73 ;million base that year.&#91;9&#93; Combined with the Mega Drive, Sega represented the majority of the console user base in Europe that year.&#91;45&#93; The Master System's largest markets in the region were France and the United Kingdom, which had active user bases of 1.6 ;million and 1.35 ;million, respectively, in 1993.&#91;9&#93; The remodeled Master System II also proved to be successful and helped Sega to sustain the Master System's significant market share in Europe. More new releases would continue into the 1990s in Europe, including Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Streets of Rage 2, and Mercs.&#91;20&#93;
The Master System brand has had continued success in Brazil, where dedicated "plug and play" consoles emulating the original hardware continue to be sold by Tectoy. These systems include the Master System Compact&#91;20&#93; and the Master System 3,&#91;46&#93; though Tectoy has also received requests to remake the original Master System.&#91;41&#93; In 2015, it was reported that Master System plug and play systems sell around 150,000 units per year in Brazil, a level that holds its own against modern systems such as the PlayStation 4.&#91;47&#93; By 2016, Tectoy had sold 8 ;million units of Master System branded systems in Brazil.&#91;48&#93;
Developed under the name "Project Mercury"&#91;49&#93; and designed based on the Master System's hardware,&#91;50&#93; the Game Gear is a handheld game console. It was first released in Japan on October 6, 1990,&#91;5&#93; in North America and Europe in 1991, and in Australia and New Zealand in 1992.&#91;49&#93; Originally retailing at JP¥19,800 in Japan,&#91;5&#93; US$149.99 in North America, and GB£99.99 in Europe,&#91;49&#93; the Game Gear was designed to compete with the Game Boy, which Nintendo had released in 1989.&#91;51&#93; There are similarities between the Game Gear and the Master System hardware, but the games are not directly compatible; Master System games are only playable on Game Gear using the Master System Converter accessory.&#91;51&#93; A large part of the Game Gear's game library consists of Master System ports. Because of hardware similarities including the landscape screen orientation, Master System games are easily portable to the handheld.&#91;49&#93; In particular, many Master System ports of Game Gear games were done by Tectoy for the Brazilian market, as the Master System was more popular than the Game Gear in the region.&#91;41&#93;
The main CPU of the Master System is a Zilog Z80A, an 8-bit processor running at 4 ;MHz. It has 8 kB of ROM, 8 kB of RAM and 16 kB of video RAM. Video is provided through an RF switch and displays at a resolution of 256 × 192 pixels and up to 32 colors at one time from a total palette of 64 colors. Physically, the Master System measures 365 by 170 by 70 millimetres (14.4 ;in × ;6.7 ;in × ;2.8 ;in),&#91;28&#93; while the Mark III measures 318 by 145 by 52 millimetres (12.5 ;in × ;5.7 ;in × ;2.0 ;in).&#91;27&#93; Both the Mark III and the Master System possess two slots for game input: one for Mega Cartridges and one for Sega Cards, along with an expansion slot and 2 controller ports.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; Sound is provided by the SN76489 PSG chip, which is capable of producing three square wave channels and one noise channel. The Japanese version also integrates the YM2413 FM chip,&#91;28&#93; which had been an optional feature on the Mark III. With few exceptions, Master System hardware is identical to the hardware in the Mark III. Games for the console are playable on the Sega Genesis using the Power Base Converter accessory,&#91;20&#93; as well as on the Game Gear using the Master System Converter.&#91;49&#93; Compared to the base NES, the Master System has twice as much memory and higher CPU clock rate.&#91;22&#93;
A number of accessories were created for the Mark III and Master System, which are cross-compatible with one another. The controller for each console consists of a rectangular shape with a control pad and two buttons. Sega also introduced additional controllers, such as a bike handle controller and paddle controller, for the Mark III and a special sports controller for the Master System. A pair of 3D glasses known as SegaScope 3-D were also created for games such as Space Harrier 3D,&#91;32&#93; although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them. The Mark III has an optional RF transmitter accessory, allowing wireless play that broadcast the game being played on a UHF television signal.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93; A light gun peripheral known as the Light Phaser&#91;32&#93; was based on the weapon of the same name from the Japanese anime Zillion.&#91;46&#93;
The Master System was produced in several variations. Released in 1990, the Master System II removed a number of components in order to reduce the cost of the console, including the Sega Card slot, reset button, power light, expansion port, and activation music and logo upon turning on the system.&#91;32&#93; Several licensed variations of the console also exist in Brazil, created by Tectoy. A variation known as the Master System Super Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter, while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl, which was molded in bright pink plastic. A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games.&#91;46&#93; Another Master System, built as a handheld game console, was released under several brands including Coleco in 2006.&#91;54&#93;
Games for the Master System are in two formats: ROM cartridges are capable of holding up to 4 Mbit of game code, while Sega Cards (My Cards in Japan) can hold up to 256 kbit. Cards were cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges and include Spy vs. Spy and Super Tennis,&#91;20&#93;&#91;32&#93; but Sega Cards were eventually dropped due to small memory size. Master System cartridges were initially branded Mega Cartridges to emphasize their large ROM size compared with cards, but this label fell into disuse after Sega ceased production of new card software.
Games manufactured for the system include Psycho Fox, Golvellius, and Phantasy Star, which became a successful franchise for Sega and is considered one of the benchmark role-playing games.&#91;55&#93; Sega's flagship character at the time, Alex Kidd, stars in games including Alex Kidd in Miracle World. Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap has garnered recognition as "a genuine milestone in video game design" due to its innovative blend of platforming gameplay with RPG elements.&#91;56&#93; Built-in games are common in Master System hardware, including Snail Maze and Hang-On, as well as Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Sonic the Hedgehog. Additional games were released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of Street Fighter II and Dynamite Headdy after the Master System was discontinued elsewhere.&#91;20&#93;
Due in part to Nintendo's licensing practices, few third-party developers contributed games for the Master System. According to Damien McFerran, "Nintendo requested that developers keep their games 'NES exclusive', and given the unassailable position the console enjoyed, few had the will to defy this request."&#91;20&#93; In addition, according to game designer Mark Cerny, most of Sega's early Master System games were developed within a strict three-month deadline, which negatively impacted game quality.&#91;31&#93;&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93; Computer Gaming World compared new Sega games to "drops of water in the desert".&#91;59&#93; Games for the Master System, however, do take advantage of the advanced hardware of the console in comparison to the NES; Alex Kidd in Miracle World, for example, showcases "blistering colors and more detailed sprites" than competing NES games.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93; In addition, the Master System version of R-Type has garnered retrospective praise for its quality, with its visuals considered comparable to those found in the TurboGrafx-16 port of the same game.&#91;62&#93;
Retro Gamer praised the system's PAL library, referring to it as a "superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives" which offered significantly greater depth than what was available in North America and provided a "drip-feed of quality titles" that continued to be released in Europe up until the mid-1990s.&#91;20&#93;&#91;63&#93; Such games ranged from 8-bit entries of Sega Genesis/Mega Drive franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Streets of Rage to dozens of exclusive PAL releases such as Lucky Dime Caper, Asterix, Ninja Gaiden, Master of Darkness and Power Strike II.&#91;63&#93;
The Sega Mark III, as well as the Japanese model of the Master System, both have full backward compatibility with SC-3000/SG-1000 game cartridges (Sega's previous family of 8-bit platforms) and both can also play Sega My Card games without the need of the Card Catcher add-on.&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93; However, educational and programming cartridges for the SC-3000 require the SK-1100 keyboard peripheral, which is compatible with the Mark III, but not with the Japanese Master System. Mark III-specific games were initially available in My Card format (labelled My Card Mark III to distinguish themselves from standard My Card games designed for the SC-3000/SG-1000), starting with Teddy Boy Blues and Hang-On, both released on October 20, 1985.&#91;66&#93; Mark III-specific cartridges were eventually made starting with Fantasy Zone, released on June 15, 1986. Every Mark III/Master System cartridge in Japan (along with the SC-3000/SG-1000-compatible game Portrait of Loretta) were released under the Gold Cartridge branding, with the exception of Argus no Jūjiken (a rebranded port of Rygar) and Solomon's Key. These two exceptions were published under a "Silver Cartridge" branding, as they were released by Salio, a short-lived subsidiary of Tecmo that was also the only third party company to ever publish Mark III/Master System games in Japan.&#91;67&#93; The Gold and Silver branding actually refer to the color of the packaging, and not the actual cartridges themselves, which were initially produced in white casing just like the Mark III console itself, but switched to black casing by the end of 1987 in order to match the Master System redesign (with the packaging and labeling of these later cartridges mentioning compatibility with both versions of the console).&#91;68&#93; The final Mark III/Master System game published by Sega in Japan is Bomber Raid, released on February 4, 1989, just a few months after the launch of the Mega Drive.
Sales of the Master System have been estimated between 10 ;million and 13 ;million units, not including recent Brazil sales.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;  The console saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America.&#91;20&#93; In 1989, the Sega Master System was listed in the top 20 products of NPD Group's Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service.&#91;69&#93; However, the Electronic Gaming Monthly 1992 Buyer's Guide indicated a souring interest in the console. Four reviewers scored the console 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality games for the Master System.&#91;70&#93; In 1993, reviewers scored the console 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases.&#91;71&#93; By contrast, 62 ;million NES units were sold, outselling the Master System several times over.&#91;6&#93; According to Bill Pearse of Playthings, the NES gained an advantage over the Master System through the use of better software and stronger character identification.&#91;72&#93; Sega would close the market share gap between itself and Nintendo in the next generation with the release of the Genesis, which sold 30.75 ;million consoles compared with the 49 ;million Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles sold by Nintendo.&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93;
Retrospective feedback of the console praises its support toward development of the Sega Genesis, but is generally critical of its small game library. Writing for AllGame, Dave Beuscher notes that "it was doomed by the lack of third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992."&#91;32&#93; On the other hand, Retro Gamer praised the system's PAL library as a "superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives", noting that it was significantly larger than its North American library.&#91;63&#93; Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer recognizes its value to the future success of the Genesis, stating, "Without this criminally undervalued machine, Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive. The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions, original IP and even create a mascot in the form of the lovable monkey-boy Alex Kidd."&#91;20&#93; In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time by the video gaming website IGN, behind both of its main competitors, the Atari 7800 (ranked 17th best) and the Nintendo Entertainment System (1st). IGN cited the Master System's small games library in the NTSC regions, coupled with the highly uneven quality of the few games that were released, as the console's major issues, stating, "Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System feel even more painful."&#91;75&#93;
The Master System and its software still retains some popularity. According to IGN, "Despite its narrow mass audience, the Master System had—and still has—a very loyal fan base."&#91;75&#93; In 2005, Sega reached a deal with Chinese company AtGames to release Master System software in the form of emulation products in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.&#91;76&#93; A number of Master System games were released for download on Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console in North America, PAL territories and Japan. The first game released for this service was Fist of the North Star, on February 26, 2008. Fantasy Zone followed on March 11. Both were released in Japan. In North America, Wonder Boy was the first Master System game released for the service on March 31, 2008.&#91;77&#93; Master System games have also been released via the GameTap online service.&#91;78&#93; In 2019, the Sega Master System: A Visual Compendium was published by Bitmap Books,&#91;79&#93; an officially licensed book looking at the history of the console and its games.&#91;80&#93;

The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced, released, and marketed by Nintendo. It is a remodelled export version of the company's Family Computer&#91;a&#93; (FC) platform in Japan, commonly known as the Famicom,&#91;b&#93; which was launched on July 15, 1983. The NES was launched in a test market of New York City on October 18, 1985, followed by Los Angeles as a second test market in February 1986, followed by Chicago and San Francisco, then other top 12 American markets, followed by a full launch across North America and some countries in Europe in September 1986, followed by Australia and other countries in Europe in 1987. Brazil saw only unlicensed clones until the official local release in 1993. The console's South Korean release was packaged as the Hyundai Comboy&#91;c&#93; and distributed by Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix).
As one of the best-selling gaming consoles of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983.&#91;11&#93; With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute games for Nintendo's platform.&#91;12&#93; It had been preceded by Nintendo's first home video game console, the Color TV-Game, and was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).
Following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the Famicom, which is short for Family Computer. Masayuki Uemura designed the system.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead decided to go for a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he believed that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.&#91;15&#93;
The code name for the project was "GameCom", but Masayuki Uemura's wife proposed the name "Famicom", arguing that "In Japan, 'pasokon' is used to mean a personal computer, but it is neither a home or personal computer. Perhaps we could say it is a family computer." Meanwhile, Hiroshi Yamauchi decided that the console should use a red and white theme after seeing a billboard for DX Antenna (a Japanese antenna manufacturer) which used those colors.&#91;15&#93;
The creation of the Famicom was hugely influenced by the ColecoVision, Coleco's competition against the Atari 2600 in the United States. Takao Sawano, chief manager of the project, brought a ColecoVision home to his family, who were impressed by the system's capability to produce smooth graphics at the time,&#91;16&#93; which contrasts with the flicker and slowdown commonly seen on Atari 2600 games. Uemura, head of Famicom development, stated that the ColecoVision set the bar for the Famicom.&#91;17&#93;
Original plans called for the Famicom's cartridges to be the size of a cassette tape, but ultimately they ended up being twice as big. Careful design attention was paid to the cartridge connectors because loose and faulty connections often plagued arcade machines. As it necessitated 60 connection lines for the memory and expansion, Nintendo decided to produce its own connectors.&#91;15&#93;
The controllers are hard-wired to the console with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied directly from the Game &amp; Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even dismantling some from American game consoles to see how they worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game &amp; Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin expansion port on the front of the console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.&#91;15&#93;
Gunpei Yokoi suggested an eject lever to the cartridge slot which is not really necessary, but he believed that children could be entertained by pressing it. Uemura adopted his idea. Uemura added a microphone to the second controller with the idea that it could be used to make players' voices sound through the TV speaker.&#91;18&#93;&#91;15&#93;
The console was released on July 15, 1983 as the Family Computer (or Famicom) for ¥14,800 (equivalent to ¥18,400&#32;in 2019) alongside three ports of Nintendo's successful arcade games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye. The Famicom was slow to gather momentum; a bad chip set caused the initial release of the system to crash. Following a product recall and a reissue with a new motherboard, the Famicom's popularity soared, becoming the best-selling game console in Japan by the end of 1984.&#91;19&#93;:279, 285
Nintendo also had its sights set on the North American market, entering into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari's name as the Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System. The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1983. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo's Donkey Kong game. This violation of Atari's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari. Atari's CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month, so the deal went nowhere, and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.&#91;19&#93;:283–285&#91;g&#93;
Subsequent plans for the Nintendo Advanced Video System likewise never materialized: a North American repackaged Famicom console featuring a keyboard, cassette data recorder, wireless joystick controller, and a special BASIC cartridge.&#91;19&#93;:287 By the beginning of 1985, more than 2.5 ;million Famicom units had been sold in Japan, and Nintendo soon announced plans to release it in North America as the Advanced Video Entertainment System (AVS) that same year. The American video game press was skeptical that the console could have any success in the region, as the industry was still recovering from the video game crash of 1983. The March 1985 issue of Electronic Games magazine stated that "the videogame market in America has virtually disappeared" and that "this could be a miscalculation on Nintendo's part".&#91;20&#93;
At June 1985's Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nintendo unveiled the American version of its Famicom, with a new case redesigned by Lance Barr and featuring a "zero insertion force" cartridge slot.&#91;21&#93; The change from a top-loader in the Famicom to a front-loader was to make the new console more like a video cassette recorder, which had grown in popularity by 1985, and differentiate the unit from past video game consoles.&#91;22&#93; Additionally Nintendo developers feared that static charges might potentially cause some electric hazards in the driest American states such as Arizona and Texas, and a front-loading design would be safer for children who handled carelessly the console, as explained by Uemura himself.&#91;23&#93;
The system's launch represented not only a new product, but also a reframing of the severely damaged home video game market. The 1983 video game crash had occurred in large part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had been partially due to confusion and misrepresentation in video game marketing. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions. In stark contrast, Nintendo's marketing strategy aimed to regain consumer and retailer confidence by delivering a singular platform whose technology was not in need of exaggeration and whose qualities were clearly defined.
To differentiate Nintendo's new home platform from the perception of a troubled and shallow video game market still reeling from the 1983 crash, the company freshened its product nomenclature and established a strict product approval and licensing policy. The overall platform is referred to as "Entertainment System" instead of a "video game system", is centered upon a machine called a "Control Deck" instead of a "console", and features software cartridges called "Game Paks" instead of "video games". This allowed Nintendo to gain more traction in selling the system in toy stores.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; To deter production of games which had not been licensed by Nintendo, and to prevent copying, the 10NES lockout chip system act as a lock-and-key coupling of each Game Pak and Control Deck. The packaging of the launch lineup of NES games bear pictures of close representations of actual onscreen graphics. To reduce consumer confusion, symbols on the games' packaging clearly indicate the genre of the game. A seal of quality is on all licensed game and accessory packaging. The initial seal states, "This seal is your assurance that Nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product". This text was later changed to "Official Nintendo Seal of Quality".&#91;29&#93;
Unlike with the Famicom, Nintendo of America marketed the console primarily to children, instituting a strict policy of censoring profanity, sexual, religious, or political content. The most famous example is Lucasfilm's attempts to port the comedy-horror game Maniac Mansion to the NES, which Nintendo insisted be considerably watered down. Nintendo of America continued its censorship policy until 1994 with the advent of the Entertainment Software Rating Board system, coinciding with criticism stemming from the cuts made to the Super NES port of Mortal Kombat compared to the Sega Genesis'.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The optional Robotic Operating Buddy, or R.O.B., was part of a marketing plan to portray the NES's technology as being novel and sophisticated when compared to previous game consoles, and to portray its position as being within reach of the better established toy market. Though at first, the American public exhibited limited excitement for the console itself, peripherals such as the light gun and R.O.B. attracted extensive attention.&#91;30&#93;
In Europe, Oceania, and Canada, the system was released in two separate marketing regions. The first consisted of mainland Europe (excluding Italy) where distribution was handled by a number of different companies, with Nintendo responsible for most cartridge releases. Most of this region saw a 1986 release. The release in the Netherlands was in Q4 1987, where it was distributed by Bandai BV.&#91;31&#93; In 1987 Mattel handled distribution for the second region, consisting of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Italy, Australia and New Zealand. Not until the 1990s did Nintendo's newly created European branch direct distribution throughout Europe.&#91;32&#93;:413–414&#91;e&#93;
In Brazil, the console was released late in 1993 by Playtronic, even after the SNES. But the Brazilian market had been dominated by unlicensed NES clones — both locally made, and smuggled from China and Taiwan.&#91;33&#93; One of the most successful local clones is the Phantom System, manufactured by Gradiente, which would end up licensing Nintendo products in the country for the following decade.&#91;34&#93; The sales of officially licensed products were low, due to the cloning, the quite late official launch, and the high prices of Nintendo's licensed products.&#91;35&#93;
For its complete North American release, the Nintendo Entertainment System was progressively released over the ensuing years in several different bundles, beginning with the Deluxe Set, the Basic Set, the Action Set and the Power Set. The Deluxe Set, retailing at US$179.99 (equivalent to $462&#32;in 2019),&#91;3&#93; included R.O.B., a light gun called the NES Zapper, two controllers, and two Game Paks: Gyromite, and Duck Hunt. The Basic Set, first released in 1987, retailed at US$89.99 with no game, and US$99.99 bundled with the Super Mario Bros. cartridge. The Action Set, retailing in November 1988 for US$149.99, came with the Control Deck, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak containing both Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt.&#91;5&#93;&#91;19&#93;:305 In 1989, the Power Set included the console, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak containing Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. In 1990, a Sports Set bundle was released, including the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four game controllers, and a dual Game Pak containing Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup.&#91;36&#93; Two more bundle packages were later released using the original model NES console. The Challenge Set of 1992 included the console, two controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak for a retail price of US$89.99. The Basic Set was repackaged for a retail US$89.99. It included only the console and two controllers, and no longer was bundled with a cartridge.&#91;36&#93; Instead, it contained a book called the Official Nintendo Player's Guide, which contained detailed information for every NES game made up to that point.
Finally, the console was redesigned for both the North American and Japanese markets as part of the final Nintendo-released bundle package. The package included the new style NES-101 console, and one redesigned "dogbone" game controller. Released in October 1993 in North America, this final bundle retailed for US$49.99 and remained in production until the discontinuation of the NES in 1995.&#91;5&#93;
On August 14, 1995, Nintendo discontinued the Nintendo Entertainment System in both North America and Europe.&#91;37&#93; In North America, replacements for the original front-loading NES were available for $25 in exchange for a broken system until at least December 1996, under Nintendo's Power Swap program. The Game Boy and Super Nintendo were also covered in this program, for $25 and $35 respectively.&#91;38&#93;
The Famicom was officially discontinued in September 2003. Nintendo offered repair service for the Famicom in Japan until 2007, when it was discontinued due to a shortage of available parts.&#91;37&#93;
Although the Japanese Famicom, North American and European NES versions included essentially the same hardware, there were certain key differences among the systems.
The original Japanese Famicom was predominantly white plastic, with dark red trim. It featured a top-loading cartridge slot, grooves on both sides of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed when not in use, and a 15-pin expansion port located on the unit's front panel for accessories.&#91;39&#93;
The original NES, meanwhile, featured a front-loading cartridge covered by a small, hinged door that can be opened to insert or remove a cartridge and closed at other times. It features a more subdued gray, black, and red color scheme. An expansion port was found on the bottom of the unit and the cartridge connector pinout was changed.
In the UK, Italy and Australia which share the PAL-A region, two versions of the NES were released; the "Mattel Version" and "NES Version".&#91;40&#93; When the NES was first released in those countries, it was distributed by Mattel and Nintendo decided to use a lockout chip specific to those countries, different from the chip used in other European countries. When Nintendo took over European distribution in 1990, it produced consoles that were then labelled "NES Version"; therefore, the only differences between the two are the text on the front flap and texture on the top/bottom of the casing.
In October 1993, Nintendo redesigned the NES to follow many of the same design cues as the newly introduced Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Japanese Super Famicom. Like the SNES, the NES-101 model loads cartridges through a covered slot on top of the unit replacing the complicated mechanism of the earlier design.
In December 1993, the Famicom received a similar redesign. It also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers. Because HVC-101 uses composite video output instead of being RF only like the HVC-001, Nintendo marketed the newer model as the AV Famicom.&#91;d&#93; Since the new controllers don't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console, certain games such as the Disk System version of The Legend of Zelda and Raid on Bungeling Bay have certain tricks that cannot be replicated when played on an HVC-101 Famicom without a modified controller. In October 1987, Nintendo released a 3D stereoscopic headset called the Famicom 3D System (HVC-031) in Japan only.
Nintendo's design styling for US release was made deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the North American video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy is to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector works quite well when both the connector and the cartridges are clean and the pins on the connector are new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector is not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserts the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bends the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge's ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges cause the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years&#91;dubious&#32; &#8211; discuss&#93; and the ZIF design prove more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector.&#91;41&#93; These design issues are exacerbated by Nintendo's choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs wear due to design and the game cartridge's brass plated nickel connectors are also prone to tarnishing and oxidation. Nintendo sought to fix these issues by redesigning the next generation Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) as a top loader similar to the Famicom to ensure better results reading the game cartridges.&#91;42&#93; Many players try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually speeds up the tarnishing due to moisture. One way to slow down the tarnishing process and extend the life of the cartridges is to use isopropyl alcohol and swabs, as well as non-conductive metal polish such as Brasso or Sheila Shine.&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93;
The Famicom contains no lockout hardware and, as a result, unlicensed cartridges (both legitimate and bootleg) were extremely common throughout Japan and the Far East.&#91;45&#93; The original NES (but not the top-loading NES-101) contain the 10NES lockout chip, which significantly increased the challenges faced by unlicensed developers. Hobbyists in later years discovered that disassembling the NES and cutting the fourth pin of the lockout chip would change the chip's mode of operation from "lock" to "key", removing all effects and greatly improving the console's ability to play legal games, as well as bootlegs and converted imports. NES consoles sold in different regions have different lockout chips, so games marketed in one region do not work on consoles from another region. Known regions are these: USA/Canada (3193 lockout chip); most of Europe (3195); Asia (3196); and UK, Italy, and Australia (3197). Because two types of lockout chip were released in Europe, European NES game boxes often have an "A" or "B" letter on the front, indicating whether the game is compatible with UK/Italian/Australian consoles (A), or the rest of Europe (B). Games in the rest of Europe typically have text on the box stating "This game is not compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System". Similarly, UK/Italy/Australia games state "This game is only compatible with the Mattel or NES versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System".
Problems with the 10NES lockout chip frequently result in the console's most infamous problem: the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. The lockout chip required constant communication with the chip in the game to work.&#91;32&#93;:247 Dirty, aging, and bent connectors often disrupt the communication, resulting in the blink effect.&#91;41&#93; Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen. Users may attempt to solve this problem by blowing air onto the cartridge connectors, inserting the cartridge just far enough to get the ZIF to lower, licking the edge connector, slapping the side of the system after inserting a cartridge, shifting the cartridge from side to side after insertion, pushing the ZIF up and down repeatedly, holding the ZIF down lower than it should have been, and cleaning the connectors with alcohol. Many of the most frequent attempts to fix this problem instead risk damaging the cartridge or system.&#91;46&#93; In 1989, Nintendo released an official NES Cleaning Kit to help users clean malfunctioning cartridges and consoles.
With the release of the top-loading NES-101 (NES 2) toward the end of the NES's lifespan, Nintendo resolved the problems by switching to a standard card edge connector and eliminating the lockout chip. All of the Famicom systems use standard card edge connectors, as do Nintendo's two subsequent game consoles, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo 64.
In response to these hardware flaws, "Nintendo Authorized Repair Centers" sprang up across the U.S. According to Nintendo, the authorization program was designed to ensure that the machines were properly repaired. Nintendo would ship the necessary replacement parts only to shops that had enrolled in the authorization program. In practice, the authorization process consisted of nothing more than paying a fee to Nintendo for the privilege.
Nintendo released a stereoscopic headset peripheral called Famicom 3D System. This was never released outside Japan, since it was a commercial failure, making some gamers experience headaches and nausea.&#91;47&#93;
Nintendo released a modem peripheral called Famicom Modem. This was not intended for traditional games but for gambling on real horse races, stock trading, and banking.
For its CPU, the NES uses the Ricoh 2A03, an 8-bit microprocessor containing a second source MOS Technology 6502 core, running at 1.79 ;MHz for the NTSC NES and 1.66 ;MHz for the PAL version.
The NES contains 2 ;kB of onboard work RAM.&#91;48&#93; A game cartridge may contain expanded RAM to increase this amount. The sizes of NES games vary from 8 kB (Galaxian) to 1 MB (Metal Slader Glory), but 128 to 384 ;kB is the most common.
The NES&#91;49&#93; uses a custom-made Picture Processing Unit (PPU) developed by Ricoh. All variations of the PPU feature 2 ;kB of video RAM, 256 ;bytes of on-die "object attribute memory" (OAM) to store the positions, colors, and tile indices of up to 64 sprites on the screen, and 28 ;bytes of on-die palette RAM to allow selection of background and sprite colors. The console's 2 ;kB of onboard RAM may be used for tile maps and attributes on the NES board and 8 ;kB of tile pattern ROM or RAM may be included on a cartridge. The system has an available color palette of 48 colors and 6 grays. Up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame: a background color, four sets of three tile colors, and four sets of three sprite colors. The NES palette is based on NTSC rather than RGB values. A total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen. The standard display resolution of the NES is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels.
Video output connections vary between console models. The original HVC-001 model of the Family Computer features only radio frequency (RF) modulator output. The North American and European consoles have support for composite video through RCA connectors in addition to the RF modulator. The HVC-101 model of the Famicom omits the RF modulator entirely and has composite video output via a proprietary 12-pin "multi-out" connector first introduced on the Super Famicom and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Conversely, the North American re-released NES-101 model most closely resembles the original HVC-001 model Famicom, in that it features RF modulator output only.&#91;50&#93; Finally, the PlayChoice-10 utilizes an inverted RGB video output.
The stock NES supports a total of five sound channels, two of which are pulse channels with 4 pulse width settings, one is a triangle wave generator, another is a noise generator (often used for percussion), and the fifth one plays low-quality digital samples.
The NES supports expansion chips contained in certain cartridges to add sound channels and help with data processing. Developers can add these chips to their games, such as the Konami VRC6, Konami VRC7, Sunsoft 5B, Namco 163, and two more by Nintendo itself: the Nintendo FDS wave generator (a modified Ricoh RP2C33 chip  with single-cycle wave table-lookup sound support), and the Nintendo Memory Management Controller 5 (MMC5).&#91;51&#93; Due to wiring differences between the Famicom and NES, a stock NES console is incapable of passing through audio generated by expansion chips utilizing additional sound channels, but can be modified to regain this capability.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;
The game controller used for both the NES and the Famicom features an oblong brick-like design with a simple four button layout: two round buttons labeled "A" and "B", a "START" button, and a "SELECT" button.&#91;54&#93; Additionally, the controllers utilize the cross-shaped joypad, designed by Nintendo employee Gunpei Yokoi for Nintendo Game &amp; Watch systems, to replace the bulkier joysticks on earlier gaming consoles' controllers.&#91;19&#93;:279
The original model Famicom features two game controllers, both of which are hardwired to the back of the console. The second controller lacks the START and SELECT buttons, but features a small microphone. Relatively few games use this feature. The earliest produced Famicom units have square A and B buttons.&#91;50&#93; This was changed to the circular designs because of the square buttons being caught in the controller casing when pressed down and glitches within the hardware causing the system to freeze occasionally while playing a game.
Instead of the Famicom's hardwired controllers, the NES features two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console to support swappable and potentially third-party controllers. The controllers bundled with the NES are identical and include the START and SELECT buttons, allowing some NES versions of games, such as The Legend of Zelda, to use the START button on the second controller to save the game at any time. The NES controllers lack the microphone, which is used on the Famicom version of Zelda to kill certain enemies, or for singing with karaoke games.&#91;39&#93;
A number of special controllers are for use with specific games, though are not very popular. Such devices include the Zapper light gun, the R.O.B.,&#91;19&#93;:297 and the Power Pad.&#91;32&#93;:226&#91;55&#93; The original Famicom features a deepened DA-15 expansion port on the front of the unit, which is used to connect most auxiliary devices.&#91;39&#93; On the NES, these special controllers are generally connected to one of the two control ports on the front of the console.
Nintendo made two advanced controllers for the NES called NES Advantage and the NES Max. Both controllers have a Turbo feature, where one press of the button represents multiple automatic rapid presses. This feature allows players to shoot much faster in shooter games. The NES Advantage has two knobs that adjust the firing rate of the turbo button from quick to Turbo, as well as a "Slow" button that slows down compatible games by rapidly pausing the game. The NES Max has a non-adjustable Turbo feature and no "Slow" feature, and has a wing-like handheld shape and a sleek directional pad. Turbo functionality exists on the NES Satellite, the NES Four Score, and the U-Force. Other accessories include the Power Pad and the Power Glove, which is featured in the movie The Wizard.
Near the end of the NES's lifespan, upon the release of the AV Famicom and the top-loading NES 2, the design of the game controllers was modified slightly. Though the original button layout was retained, the controller's shape resembles that of the SNES's controller. In addition, the AV Famicom dropped the hardwired controllers in favor of detachable controller ports. The controllers included with the Famicom AV have 90 ;cm (3 feet) long cables, compared to the 180 ;cm (6 feet) of NES controllers.&#91;56&#93;
The original NES controller has become one of the most recognizable symbols of the console. Nintendo has mimicked the look of the controller in several other products, from promotional merchandise to limited edition versions of the Game Boy Advance.&#91;57&#93;
Few of the numerous peripheral devices and software packages for the Famicom were released outside Japan.
Family BASIC is an implementation of BASIC for the Famicom, packaged with a keyboard. Similar in concept to the Atari 2600 BASIC cartridge, it allows the user to write programs, especially games, which can be saved on an included cassette recorder.&#91;58&#93; Nintendo of America rejected releasing Famicom BASIC in the US because it did not think it fit their primary marketing demographic of children.&#91;32&#93;:162
The Famicom Modem connected a Famicom to a now defunct proprietary network in Japan which provided content such as financial services.&#91;59&#93; A dialup modem was never released for NES.
In 1986, Nintendo released the Famicom Disk System (FDS) in Japan, a type of floppy drive that uses a single-sided, proprietary 5 ;cm (2") disk and plugs into the cartridge port. It contains RAM for the game to load into and an extra single-cycle wave table-lookup sound chip. The disks are used both for storing the game and saving progress, with a total capacity of 128k (64k per side). The disks were originally obtained from kiosks in malls and other public places where buyers could select a game and have it written to the disk. This process cost less than cartridges and users could take the disk back to a vending booth and have it rewritten with a new game, or the high score faxed to Nintendo for national leaderboard contests.
A variety of games for the FDS were released by Nintendo (including some which had already been released on cartridge, such as Super Mario Bros.), and third party companies such as Konami, Taito, or unlicensed publishers. Its limitations became quickly apparent as larger ROM chips were introduced, allowing cartridges with greater than 128k of space. More advanced memory management chips (MMC) soon appeared and the FDS quickly became obsolete. Nintendo also charged developers high prices to produce FDS games, and many refused to develop for it, instead continuing to make cartridge games.&#91;citation needed&#93; After only two years, the FDS was discontinued, although vending booths remained in place until 1993 and Nintendo continued to service drives, and to rewrite and offer replacement disks until 2003. Approximately four million drives were sold.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Nintendo did not release the Disk System outside Japan due to numerous problems encountered with the medium in Japan, and due to the increasing data storage capacity and reducing cost of the highly reliable cartridge medium.&#91;60&#93; As a result, many Disk System games such as Castlevania, The Legend of Zelda, and Bubble Bobble were converted to cartridge format for their export releases, resulting in simplified sound and the disk save function replaced by either password or battery save systems.
A thriving market of unlicensed NES hardware clones emerged during the climax of the console's popularity. Initially, such clones were popular in markets where Nintendo issued a legitimate version of the console long time after unlicensed hardware. In particular, the Dendy (Russian: Де́нди), an unlicensed hardware clone produced in Taiwan and sold in the former Soviet Union, emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the NES/Famicom in North America and Japan. A range of Famicom clones was marketed in Argentina during the late 1980s and early 1990s under the name of "Family Game", resembling the original hardware design. The Micro Genius (Simplified Chinese: 小天才) was marketed in Southeast Asia as an alternative to the Famicom; Samurai was the popular PAL alternative to the NES; and in Central Europe, especially Poland, the Pegasus was available.&#91;61&#93; Since 1989, there were many Brazilian clones of NES,&#91;35&#93; and the very popular Phantom System (with hardware superior to the original console) caught the attention of Nintendo itself.&#91;34&#93;
The unlicensed clone market has flourished following Nintendo's discontinuation of the NES. Some of the more exotic of these resulting systems surpass the functionality of the original hardware, such as a portable system with a color LCD (PocketFami). Others have been produced for certain specialized markets, such as a rather primitive personal computer with a keyboard and basic word processing software.&#91;62&#93; These unauthorized clones have been helped by the invention of the so-called NES-on-a-chip.&#91;63&#93;
As was the case with unlicensed games, Nintendo has typically gone to the courts to prohibit the manufacture and sale of unlicensed cloned hardware. Many of the clone vendors have included built-in copies of licensed Nintendo software, which constitutes copyright infringement in most countries.
Although most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, certain companies were granted licenses to produce NES-compatible devices. The Sharp Corporation produced at least two such clones: the Twin Famicom and the SHARP 19SC111 television. The Twin Famicom is compatible with both Famicom cartridges and Famicom Disk System disks.&#91;64&#93;:29 Like the Famicom, it is red and black and has hardwired controllers, but has a different case design. The SHARP 19SC111 television includes a built-in Famicom.&#91;65&#93; A similar licensing deal was reached with Hyundai Electronics, who licensed the system under the name Comboy in the South Korean market. This deal with Hyundai was made necessary because of the South Korean government's wide ban on all Japanese "cultural products", which remained in effect until 1998 and ensured that the only way Japanese products could legally enter the South Korean market was through licensing to a third-party (non-Japanese) distributor (see also Japan–Korea disputes).&#91;66&#93; In India, the system was sold under the name Samurai and assembled locally under license from kits due to policies that banned imports of electronics.&#91;67&#93;
The NES Test Station diagnostics machine was introduced in 1988. It is a NES-based unit designed for testing NES hardware, components, and games. It was only provided for use in World of Nintendo boutiques as part of the Nintendo World Class Service program. Visitors were to bring items to test with the station, and could be assisted by a store technician or employee.
The NES Test Station's front features a Game Pak slot and connectors for testing various components (AC adapter, RF switch, Audio/Video cable, NES Control Deck, accessories and games), with a centrally-located selector knob to choose which component to test. The unit itself weighs approximately 11.7 pounds without a TV. It connects to a television via a combined A/V and RF Switch cable. By actuating the green button, a user can toggle between an A/V Cable or RF Switch connection. The television it is connected to (typically 11" to 14") is meant to be placed atop it.&#91;68&#93;
In 1991, Nintendo provided an add-on called the "Super NES Counter Tester" that tests Super Nintendo components and games. The SNES Counter Tester is a standard SNES on a metal fixture with the connection from the back of the SNES re-routed to the front of the unit. These connections may be made directly to the test station or to the TV, depending on what is to be tested.
The Nintendo Entertainment System has a number of groundbreaking games. Super Mario Bros. pioneered side-scrollers whilst The Legend of Zelda established the genre of action adventure games, and helped popularize battery-backed save functionality.  A third influential game is Metroid, a game that established the Metroidvania genre.
The NES uses a 72-pin design, as compared with 60 pins on the Famicom. To reduce costs and inventory, some early games released in North America are simply Famicom cartridges attached to an adapter to fit inside the NES hardware.&#91;26&#93; Early NES cartridges are held together with five small slotted screws. Games released after 1987 were redesigned slightly to incorporate two plastic clips molded into the plastic itself, removing the need for the top two screws.&#91;69&#93;
The back of the cartridge bears a label with handling instructions. Production and software revision codes were imprinted as stamps on the back label to correspond with the software version and producer. All licensed NTSC and PAL cartridges are a standard shade of gray plastic, with the exception of The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, which were manufactured in gold-plastic carts. Unlicensed carts were produced in black, robin egg blue, and gold, and are all slightly different shapes than standard NES cartridges. Nintendo also produced yellow-plastic carts for internal use at Nintendo Service Centers, although these "test carts" were never made available for purchase. All licensed US cartridges were made by Nintendo, Konami, and Acclaim. For promotion of DuckTales: Remastered, Capcom sent 150 limited-edition gold NES cartridges with the original game, featuring the Remastered art as the sticker, to different gaming news agencies. The instruction label on the back includes the opening lyric from the show's theme song, "Life is like a hurricane".&#91;70&#93;
Famicom cartridges are shaped slightly differently. Unlike NES games, official Famicom cartridges were produced in many colors of plastic. Adapters, similar in design to the popular accessory Game Genie, are available that allow Famicom games to be played on an NES. In Japan, several companies manufactured the cartridges for the Famicom.&#91;32&#93;:61 This allowed these companies to develop their own customized chips designed for specific purposes, such as superior sound and graphics.
Nintendo's near monopoly on the home video game market left it with a dominant influence over the industry. Unlike Atari, which never actively pursued third-party developers (and even went to court in an attempt to force Activision to cease production of Atari 2600 games), Nintendo had anticipated and encouraged the involvement of third-party software developers, though strictly on Nintendo's terms.&#91;71&#93; Some of the Nintendo platform-control measures were adopted in a less stringent way by later console manufacturers such as Sega, Sony, and Microsoft.
To this end, a 10NES authentication chip is in every console and in every officially licensed cartridge. If the console's chip can not detect a counterpart chip inside the cartridge, the game does not load.&#91;32&#93;:247 Nintendo portrayed these measures as intended to protect the public against poor-quality games,&#91;72&#93; and placed a golden seal of approval on all licensed games released for the system.
Nintendo found success with Japanese arcade manufacturers such as Konami, Capcom, Taito and Namco, which signed on as third-party developers. However, they found resistance with US game developers including Atari, Activision, Electronic Arts and Epyx refusing Nintendo's one-sided terms. Acclaim Entertainment, a fledgling game publisher founded by former Activision employees, would be the first major third-party licensee based out of the United States to sign on with Nintendo in late 1987. Atari (through Tengen) and Activision would sign on soon after.
Nintendo was not as restrictive as Sega, which did not permit third-party publishing until Mediagenic in late summer 1988.&#91;73&#93; Nintendo's intention was to reserve a large part of NES game revenue for itself. Nintendo required that it be the sole manufacturer of all cartridges, and that the publisher had to pay in full before the cartridges for that game be produced. Cartridges could not be returned to Nintendo, so publishers assumed all the risk. As a result, some publishers lost more money due to distress sales of remaining inventory at the end of the NES era than they ever earned in profits from sales of the games. Because Nintendo controlled the production of all cartridges, it was able to enforce strict rules on its third-party developers, which were required to sign a contract by Nintendo that would obligate these parties to develop exclusively for the system, order at least 10,000 cartridges, and only make five games per year.&#91;32&#93;:214–215 The global 1988 shortage of DRAM and ROM chips reportedly caused Nintendo to only permit an average of 25% of publishers' requests for cartridges, with some receiving much higher amounts and others almost none.&#91;72&#93; GameSpy noted that Nintendo's "iron-clad terms" made the company many enemies during the 1980s. Some developers tried to circumvent the five game limit by creating additional company brands like Konami's Ultra Games label and others tried circumventing the 10NES chip.&#91;71&#93;
Nintendo was accused of antitrust behavior because of the strict licensing requirements.&#91;74&#93; The United States Department of Justice and several states began probing Nintendo's business practices, leading to the involvement of Congress and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC conducted an extensive investigation which included interviewing hundreds of retailers. During the FTC probe, Nintendo changed the terms of its publisher licensing agreements to eliminate the two-year rule and other restrictive terms. Nintendo and the FTC settled the case in April 1991, with Nintendo required to send vouchers giving a $5 discount off to a new game, to every person that had purchased a NES game between June 1988 and December 1990. GameSpy remarked that Nintendo's punishment was particularly weak giving the case's findings, although it has been speculated that the FTC did not want to damage the video game industry in the United States.&#91;71&#93;
With the NES near its end of its life many third-party publishers such as Electronic Arts supported upstart competing consoles with less strict licensing terms such as the Sega Genesis and then the PlayStation, which eroded and then took over Nintendo's dominance in the home console market, respectively. Consoles from Nintendo's rivals in the post-SNES era had always enjoyed much stronger third-party support than Nintendo, which relied more heavily on first-party games.
Companies that refused to pay the licensing fee or were rejected by Nintendo found ways to circumvent the console's authentication system. Most of these companies created circuits that use a voltage spike to temporarily disable the 10NES chip.&#91;32&#93;:286 A few unlicensed games released in Europe and Australia are in the form of a dongle to connect to a licensed game, in order to use the licensed game's 10NES chip for authentication. To combat unlicensed games, Nintendo of America threatened retailers who sold them with losing their supply of licensed games, and multiple revisions were made to the NES PCBs to prevent unlicensed games from working.
Atari Games took a different approach with its line of NES products, Tengen. The company attempted to reverse engineer the lockout chip to develop its own "Rabbit" chip. Tengen also obtained a description of the lockout chip from the United States Patent and Trademark Office by falsely claiming that it was required to defend against present infringement claims. Nintendo successfully sued Tengen for copyright infringement. Tengen's antitrust claims against Nintendo were never decided.&#91;74&#93;
Color Dreams made Christian video games under the subsidiary name Wisdom Tree. Historian Steven Kent wrote, "Wisdom Tree presented Nintendo with a prickly situation. The general public did not seem to pay close attention to the court battle with Atari Games, and industry analysts were impressed with Nintendo's legal acumen; but going after a tiny company that published innocuous religious games was another story."&#91;19&#93;:400
As the Nintendo Entertainment System grew in popularity and entered millions of American homes, some small video rental shops began buying their own copies of NES games, and renting them out to customers for around the same price as a video cassette rental for a few days. Nintendo received no profit from the practice beyond the initial cost of their game, and unlike movie rentals, a newly released game could hit store shelves and be available for rent on the same day. Nintendo took steps to stop game rentals, but didn't take any formal legal action until Blockbuster Video began to make game rentals a large-scale service. Nintendo claimed that allowing customers to rent games would significantly hurt sales and drive up the cost of games.&#91;75&#93; Nintendo lost the lawsuit,&#91;76&#93; but did win on a claim of copyright infringement.&#91;77&#93; Blockbuster was banned from including original, copyrighted instruction booklets with its rented games. In compliance with the ruling, Blockbuster produced original short instructions—usually in the form of a small booklet, card, or label stuck on the back of the rental box—that explained the game's basic premise and controls. Video rental shops continued the practice of renting video games.
By 1988, industry observers stated that the NES's popularity had grown so quickly that the market for Nintendo cartridges was larger than that for all home computer software.&#91;78&#93;&#91;19&#93;:347 Compute! reported in 1989 that Nintendo had sold seven million NES systems in 1988 alone, almost as many as the number of Commodore 64s sold in its first five years.&#91;79&#93; "Computer game makers [are] scared stiff", the magazine said, stating that Nintendo's popularity caused most competitors to have poor sales during the previous Christmas and resulted in serious financial problems for some.&#91;80&#93;
In June 1989, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing Peter Main, said that the Famicom was present in 37% of Japan's households.&#91;81&#93; By 1990, 30% of American households owned the NES, compared to 23% for all personal computers.&#91;82&#93; By 1990, the NES had outsold all previously released consoles worldwide.&#91;83&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93; The slogan for this brand was "It can't be beaten".&#91;32&#93;:345 The Nintendo Entertainment System was not available in the Soviet Union.
In the early 1990s, gamers predicted that competition from technologically superior systems such as the 16-bit Sega Genesis would mean the immediate end of the NES's dominance. Instead, during the first year of Nintendo's successor console the Super Famicom (named Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan), the Famicom remained the second highest-selling video game console in Japan, outselling the newer and more powerful NEC PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by a wide margin.&#91;84&#93; The launch of the Genesis was overshadowed by the launch of Super Mario Bros. 3 for NES.&#91;citation needed&#93; The console remained popular in Japan and North America until late 1993, when the demand for new NES software abruptly plummeted.&#91;84&#93; The final licensed Famicom game released in Japan is Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima IV (Adventure Island IV), in North America is Wario's Woods, and in Europe is The Lion King in 1995.&#91;85&#93; In the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new games, Nintendo of America officially discontinued the NES by 1995.&#91;5&#93;&#91;86&#93; Nintendo produced new Famicom units in Japan until September 25, 2003,&#91;87&#93; and continued to repair Famicom consoles until October 31, 2007, attributing the discontinuation of support to insufficient supplies of parts.&#91;88&#93;&#91;89&#93;
The NES was released two years after the North American video game crash of 1983, when many retailers and adult consumers regarded electronic games as a passing fad,&#91;19&#93;:280 so many believed at first that the NES would soon fade.&#91;80&#93; Before the NES and Famicom, Nintendo was known as a moderately successful Japanese toy and playing card manufacturer, but the consoles' popularity helped the company grow into an internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games as Atari had been,&#91;90&#93; and set the stage for Japanese dominance of the video game industry.&#91;91&#93; With the NES, Nintendo also changed the relationship between console manufacturers and third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval. This led to higher-quality  games, which helped change the attitude of a public that had grown weary from poorly produced games for earlier systems.&#91;19&#93;:306–307
The NES hardware design is also very influential. Nintendo chose the name "Nintendo Entertainment System" for the US market and redesigned the system so it would not give the appearance of a child's toy. The front-loading cartridge input allow it to be used more easily in a TV stand with other entertainment devices, such as a videocassette recorder.&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93;
The system's hardware limitations led to design principles that still influence the development of modern video games. Many prominent game franchises originated on the NES, including Nintendo's own Super Mario Bros.,&#91;64&#93;|:57 The Legend of Zelda&#91;19&#93;:353 and Metroid,&#91;19&#93;:357 Capcom's Mega Man&#91;95&#93; franchise, Konami's Castlevania&#91;19&#93;:358 franchise, Square's Final Fantasy,&#91;64&#93;|:95 and Enix's Dragon Quest&#91;64&#93;|:222 franchises.
NES imagery, especially its controller, has become a popular motif for a variety of products,&#91;96&#93;&#91;97&#93;&#91;98&#93;&#91;99&#93; including Nintendo's own Game Boy Advance.&#91;57&#93; Clothing, accessories, and food items adorned with NES-themed imagery are still produced and sold in stores.
The NES can be emulated on many other systems. The first emulator was the Japanese-only Pasofami. It was soon followed by iNES, which is available in English and is cross-platform, in 1996. It was described as being the first NES emulation software that could be used by a non-expert.&#91;100&#93; NESticle, a popular MS-DOS-based emulator, was released on April 3, 1997. Nintendo offers officially licensed emulation of many specific NES games via its own Virtual Console for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U, and the Nintendo Switch Online service.
On July 14, 2016, Nintendo announced the November 2016 launch of a miniature replica of the NES, named the Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition in the United States and Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe and Australia.&#91;101&#93; The emulation-based console includes 30 permanently inbuilt games from the vintage NES library, including the Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda series. The system features HDMI display output and a new replica controller, which can also connect to the Wii Remote for use with Virtual Console games.&#91;102&#93;&#91;103&#93; It was discontinued in North America on April 13, 2017, and worldwide on April 15, 2017. However, Nintendo announced in September 2017 that the NES Classic Mini would return to production on June 29, 2018, only to be discontinued again permanently by December of that year.&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93;

The Sega Genesis, known as the Mega Drive&#91;b&#93; outside North America, is a 16-bit fourth generation home video game console developed and sold by Sega. The Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. Sega released it as the Mega Drive in Japan in 1988, and later as the Genesis in North America in 1989. In 1990, it was distributed as the Mega Drive by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe, Ozisoft in Australasia, and Tec Toy in Brazil. In South Korea, it was distributed by Samsung as the Super Gam*Boy and later the Super Aladdin Boy.&#91;c&#93;
Designed by an R&amp;D team supervised by Hideki Sato and Masami Ishikawa, the Genesis was adapted from Sega's System 16 arcade board, centered on a Motorola 68000 processor as the CPU, a Zilog Z80 as a sound controller, and a video system supporting hardware sprites, tiles, and scrolling. It plays a library of more than 900 games created by Sega and a wide array of third-party publishers delivered on ROM-based cartridges. Several add-ons were released, including a Power Base Converter to play Master System games. It was released in several different versions, some created by third parties. Sega created two network services to support the Genesis: Sega Meganet and Sega Channel.
In Japan, the Mega Drive fared poorly against its two main competitors, Nintendo's Super Famicom and NEC's PC Engine (aka TurboGrafx-⁠16), but it achieved considerable success in North America, Brazil, and Europe. Contributing to its success were its library of arcade game ports, the popularity of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, several popular sports franchises, and aggressive youth marketing that positioned the system as the cool console for adolescents. The North American release in 1991 of the Super Famicom, rebranded as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, resulted in a fierce battle for market share in the United States and Europe that has often been termed as a "console war" by journalists and historians.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; As this contest drew increasing attention to the video game industry among the general public, the Genesis and several of its highest-profile games attracted significant legal scrutiny on matters involving reverse engineering and video game violence. Controversy surrounding violent games such as Night Trap and Mortal Kombat led Sega to create the Videogame Rating Council, a predecessor to the Entertainment Software Rating Board.
30.75 ;million first-party Genesis units were sold worldwide. In addition, Tec Toy sold an estimated three million licensed variants in Brazil, Majesco projected it would sell 1.5 ;million licensed variants of the system in the United States, and much smaller numbers were sold by Samsung in South Korea. By the mid-2010s, licensed third-party Genesis rereleases were still being sold by AtGames in North America and Europe. Many games have been re-released in compilations or on online services such as the Nintendo Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam. The Genesis was succeeded in 1994 by the Sega Saturn.
In the early 1980s, Sega Enterprises, Inc. &#8211; then a subsidiary of Gulf+Western &#8211; was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues surpassed $200 ;million between July 1981 and June 1982.&#91;5&#93; A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company, leading Gulf+Western to sell its North American arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93; The company retained Sega's North American R&amp;D operation, as well as its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. With its arcade business in decline, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. president Hayao Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise to move into the home console market in Japan, which was in its infancy at the time.&#91;8&#93;
Nakayama received permission to proceed with this project, leading to the release of Sega's first home video game system, the SG-1000, in July 1983.&#91;9&#93; While it had sold 160,000 units in Japan, far exceeding Sega's expectations,&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; sales at stores were dominated by Nintendo's Famicom which had been released the same day. Sega estimated that the Famicom outsold the SG-1000 by a 10-to-1 margin.&#91;9&#93; The SG-1000 was replaced by the Sega Mark III within two years.&#91;12&#93; In the meantime, Gulf+Western began to divest itself of its non-core businesses after the death of company founder Charles Bluhdorn,&#91;13&#93; so Nakayama and former Sega CEO David Rosen arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation, a prominent Japanese software company. Nakayama was then installed as CEO of Sega Enterprises, Ltd.&#91;14&#93;
In 1986, Sega redesigned the Mark III for release in North America as the Master System. This was followed by a European release the next year. Although the Master System was a success in Europe, and later in Brazil, it failed to ignite significant interest in the Japanese or North American markets, which, by the mid-to-late 1980s, were both dominated by Nintendo.&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93; With Sega continuing to have difficulty penetrating the home market, Sega's console R&amp;D team, led by Masami Ishikawa and supervised by Hideki Sato,&#91;18&#93; began work on a successor to the Master System almost immediately after that console launched.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93;
In 1987, Sega faced another threat to its console business when Japanese computer giant NEC released the PC Engine amid great publicity.&#91;21&#93; To remain competitive against the two more established consumer electronics companies, Ishikawa and his team decided they needed to incorporate a 16-bit microprocessor into their new system to make an impact in the marketplace and once again turned to Sega's strengths in the arcade industry to adapt the successful Sega System 16 arcade board into architecture for a home console.&#91;20&#93;&#91;22&#93; The decision to use a Motorola 68000 as the system's main CPU was made late in development, while a Zilog Z80 was used as a secondary CPU to handle the sound due to fears that the load to the main CPU would be too great if it handled both the visuals and the audio.&#91;20&#93; The 68000 chip was expensive and would have driven the retail price of the console up greatly, but Sega was able to negotiate with a distributor for a tenth of its price on an up-front volume order with the promise of more orders pending the console's future success.&#91;9&#93;
The appearance of the Mega Drive was designed by a team led by Mitsushige Shiraiwa that drew inspiration from audiophile equipment and automobiles. Shiraiwa said this more mature look helped to target the Mega Drive to all ages, unlike the Famicom, which was aimed primarily at children.&#91;23&#93; According to Sato, the Japanese design for the Mega Drive was based on the appearance of an audio player, and presents the text "16-bit" embossed in a golden metallic veneer to give the impression of power.&#91;11&#93;
First announced in the June 1988 issue of Japanese gaming magazine Beep!, the developing console was initially called the "Mark V", but Sega management wanted a stronger name. After reviewing more than 300 proposals, the company settled on "Mega Drive". In North America, the name of the console was changed to "Genesis". The reason for this change is not known, but it may have been due to a trademark dispute.&#91;22&#93; Sato stated that some design aesthetics had to change, such as the gold-colored "16-bit" wording, because it was believed that the color would be mistaken for yellow. He believes that the changes in design are representative of the differences in values between Japanese and American culture.&#91;11&#93;
Sega released the Mega Drive in Japan on October 29, 1988, though the launch was overshadowed by Nintendo's release of Super Mario Bros. 3 a week earlier. Positive coverage from magazines Famitsu and Beep! helped to establish a following, but Sega only managed to ship 400,000 units in the first year. In order to increase sales, Sega released various peripherals and games, including an online banking system and answering machine called the Sega Mega Anser.&#91;22&#93; Nevertheless, the Mega Drive was unable to overtake the venerable Famicom&#91;24&#93; and remained a distant third in Japan behind Nintendo's Super Famicom and NEC's PC Engine throughout the 16-bit era.&#91;25&#93;
Sega announced a North American release date for the system on January 9, 1989.&#91;26&#93; At the time, Sega did not possess a North American sales and marketing organization and was distributing its Master System through Tonka. Dissatisfied with Tonka's performance, Sega looked for a new partner to market the Genesis in North America and offered the rights to Atari Corporation, which did not yet have a 16-bit system. David Rosen made the proposal to Atari CEO Jack Tramiel and the president of Atari's Entertainment Electronics Division, Michael Katz. Tramiel declined to acquire the new console, deeming it too expensive, and instead opted to focus on the Atari ST. Sega decided to launch the console through its own Sega of America subsidiary, which executed a limited launch on August 14, 1989, in New York City and Los Angeles. The Genesis was released in the rest of North America later that year.&#91;27&#93;
The European version was released in September 1990,&#91;28&#93; at a price of GB£189.99.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93; The release was handled by Virgin Mastertronic, which was later purchased by Sega in 1991 and became Sega of Europe.&#91;31&#93; Games like Space Harrier II, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Golden Axe,&#91;30&#93; Super Thunder Blade, and The Revenge of Shinobi were available in stores at launch. The console was also bundled with Altered Beast.&#91;29&#93; The Mega Drive and its first batch of games were shown at the 1990 European Computer Entertainment Show (ECES) in Earl's Court.&#91;32&#93; Between July and August 1990, Virgin initially placed their order for 20,000 Mega Drive units. However, the company increased the order by 10,000 units when advanced orders had exceeded expectations, and another 10,000 units was later added following the console's success at the ECES event. The projected number of units to be sold between September and December 1990 had eventually increased to 40,000 units in the United Kingdom alone.&#91;33&#93;
Other companies assisted in distributing the console to various countries worldwide. Ozisoft handled the Mega Drive's launch and marketing in Australia, as it had done before with the Master System.&#91;34&#93; In Brazil, the Mega Drive was released by Tectoy in 1990,&#91;35&#93; only a year after the Brazilian release of the Master System. Tectoy produced games exclusively for the Brazilian market, and brought the Sega Meganet online service there in 1995.&#91;36&#93; In India, Sega entered a distribution deal with Shaw Wallace in the spring of 1995 in order to circumvent an 80% import tariff, with each unit selling for INR₹18,000.&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93; Samsung handled sales and distribution in Korea, where it was named Super Gam*Boy and retained the Mega Drive logo alongside the Samsung name.&#91;39&#93; It was later renamed Super Aladdin Boy.&#91;40&#93;
For the North American market, former Atari Corporation Entertainment Electronics Division president and new Sega of America CEO Michael Katz instituted a two-part approach to build sales in the region. The first part involved a marketing campaign to challenge Nintendo head-on and emphasize the more arcade-like experience available on the Genesis,&#91;41&#93; summarized by slogans including "Genesis does what Nintendon't".&#91;22&#93; Since Nintendo owned the console rights to most arcade games of the time, the second part involved creating a library of instantly recognizable games which used the names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes such as Pat Riley Basketball, Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf, James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, Joe Montana Football, Tommy Lasorda Baseball, Mario Lemieux Hockey, and Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.&#91;21&#93;&#91;42&#93; Nonetheless, it had a hard time overcoming Nintendo's ubiquitous presence in consumers' homes.&#91;43&#93; Tasked by Nakayama to sell one million units within the first year, Katz and Sega of America managed to sell only 500,000 units.&#91;22&#93;
In mid-1990, Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske to replace Katz as CEO of Sega of America. Although Kalinske initially knew little about the video game market, he surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the razor and blades business model, he developed a four-point plan: cut the price of the console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with a new game, Sonic the Hedgehog.&#91;43&#93; The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan,&#91;44&#93; but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it."&#91;22&#93; Magazines praised Sonic as one of the greatest games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the release of the international version of Nintendo's Super Famicom, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), decided to purchase a Genesis instead.&#91;43&#93; Nintendo's console debuted against an established competitor, while NEC's TurboGrafx-16 failed to gain traction, and NEC soon pulled out of the market.&#91;45&#93; In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog, the Genesis outsold the SNES in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. This success led to Sega having control of 65% of the 16-bit console market in January 1992, making it the first time Nintendo was not the console leader since December 1985.&#91;46&#93;
To compete with Nintendo, Sega was more open to new types of games than its rival, but still tightly controlled the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing.&#91;47&#93; Technicians from American third-party video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989,&#91;48&#93; following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system.&#91;49&#93; The clean room reverse engineering was led by Steve Hayes and Jim Nitchals, lasting several months before EA secretly began game development.&#91;49&#93; EA founder Trip Hawkins confronted Nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), noting that EA had the ability to run its own licensing program if Sega refused to meet its demands. Sega relented, and the next day EA's upcoming Genesis games were showcased at CES.&#91;49&#93; EA signed what Hawkins described as "a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement" with Sega in June 1990: "Among other things, we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted. We could approve our own titles ;... the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable. We also had more direct control over manufacturing."&#91;48&#93; After the deal was in place, EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon learned that "we hadn't figured out all the workarounds" and "Sega still had the ability to lock us out," noting "It just would have been a public relations fiasco."&#91;49&#93; EA released its first two Genesis games, Populous and Budokan: The Martial Spirit, within the month.&#91;48&#93; The first Genesis version of EA's John Madden Football arrived before the end of 1990,&#91;48&#93; and became what Gordon called a "killer app" for the system.&#91;49&#93; Taking advantage of the licensing agreement, Gordon and EA's vice president of marketing services Nancy Fong created a visual identifier for EA's Genesis cartridges: A yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing.&#91;49&#93;
Sega was able to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row&#91;50&#93; due to the Genesis having a two-year lead, a lower price point, and a larger game library compared to the SNES at its release.&#91;51&#93; Sega had ten games for every game on SNES, and while the SNES had an exclusive version of Final Fight, one of Sega's internal development teams created Streets of Rage, which had bigger levels, tougher enemies, and a well-regarded soundtrack.&#91;51&#93; ASCII Entertainment reported in early 1993 that Genesis had 250 games versus 75 for the SNES, but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 SNES games. The NES was still the leader, with 300 games and 100 on shelves.&#91;52&#93;
Sega's advertising positioned the Genesis as the cooler console,&#91;51&#93; and as its advertising evolved, the company coined the term blast processing (an obscure and unutilized programming trick on the graphics hardware) to suggest that its processing capabilities were far greater than those of the SNES.&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93; A Sony focus group found that teenage boys would not admit to owning an SNES rather than a Genesis.&#91;55&#93; With the Genesis often outselling the SNES at a ratio of 2:1,&#91;56&#93; Nintendo and Sega both focused heavily on impression management of the market, even going to the point of deception, with Nintendo claiming it had sold more consoles in 1991 than it actually had, and forecasting it would sell 6 ;million consoles by the end of 1992, while its actual U.S. install base at the end of 1992 was only just more than 4 ;million units.&#91;57&#93; Due to these tactics, it was difficult to ascertain a clear leader in market share for several years at a time, with Nintendo's dollar share of the U.S. 16-bit market dipping down from 60% at the end of 1992 to 37% at the end of 1993,&#91;58&#93; Sega claiming 55% of all 16-bit hardware sales during 1994,&#91;59&#93; and Donkey Kong Country helping the SNES to outsell the Genesis from 1995 through 1997.&#91;50&#93;&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93; According to a 2004 study of NPD sales data, the Genesis was able to maintain its lead over the Super NES in the American 16-bit console market.&#91;64&#93; However, according to a 2014 Wedbush Securities report based on revised NPD sales data, the SNES outsold the Genesis in the U.S. market.&#91;65&#93;
Sega held a company-wide contest to create a mascot character to compete with Nintendo's Mario series. The winning submission was a blue hedgehog with red shoes, Sonic, created by Naoto Ohshima,&#91;66&#93; spawning one of the best-selling video game franchises in history.&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93; The gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog originated with a tech demo created by Yuji Naka, who had developed a prototype platform game that involved a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube. This concept was developed with Ohshima's character design and levels conceived by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara.&#91;69&#93;
Although Katz and Sega of America's marketing experts disliked Sonic, certain that it would not catch on with most American kids,&#91;21&#93;&#91;70&#93; Kalinske's strategy to place Sonic the Hedgehog as the pack-in game paid off.&#91;3&#93;&#91;71&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog greatly increased the popularity of the Genesis in North America,&#91;54&#93; and the bundle is credited with helping Sega gain 65% of the market share against Nintendo.&#91;1&#93;
After the release of the Genesis in 1989, video game publisher Accolade began exploring options to release some of their PC games on the console. At the time, Sega had a licensing deal in place for third-party developers that increased the costs to the developer. According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, "One pays them between $10 and $15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs, so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher."&#91;72&#93; To get around licensing, Accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the Genesis. It did so by purchasing one in order to decompile the executable code of three Genesis games. Such information was used to program their new Genesis cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts on the Genesis that prevented unlicensed games from being played.&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93; This strategy was used successfully to bring Ishido: The Way of Stones to the Genesis in 1990.&#91;75&#93; To do so, Accolade had copied Sega's copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of Sega's licensed Genesis games.&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93;
As a result of piracy in some countries and unlicensed development issues, Sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the Genesis released in 1990, referred to as the Genesis III. This new variation of the Genesis included a code known as the Trademark Security System (TMSS), which, when a game cartridge was inserted, would check for the presence of the string "SEGA" at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge. If the string was present, the console would run the game, and would briefly display the message: ".mw-parser-output span.smallcaps{font-variant:small-caps}.mw-parser-output span.smallcaps-smaller{font-size:85%}Produced by or under license from Sega Enterprises, Ltd."&#91;73&#93; This system had a twofold effect: it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy, and forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up, making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed.&#91;74&#93;&#91;77&#93; Accolade learned of this development at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1991, where Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an Ishido game cartridge.&#91;74&#93; With more games planned for the following year, Accolade successfully identified the TMSS file. It later added this file to the games HardBall!, Star Control, Mike Ditka Power Football, and Turrican.&#91;74&#93;
In response to the creation of these unlicensed games, Sega filed suit against Accolade in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and copyright infringement. In response, Accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the Sega trademark when the game was powered up.&#91;76&#93;&#91;78&#93; Although the district court initially ruled for Sega and issued an injunction preventing Accolade from continuing to reverse engineer the Genesis, Accolade appealed the verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.&#91;79&#93;
As a result of the appeal, the Ninth Circuit overturned the district court's verdict and ruled that Accolade's decompilation of the Sega software constituted fair use.&#91;80&#93; The court's written opinion followed on October 20, 1992, and noted that the use of the software was non-exploitative, although commercial.&#91;73&#93;&#91;81&#93; Further, the court found that the trademark infringement, being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system, had been inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and was the fault of Sega for having caused false labeling.&#91;73&#93; Ultimately, Sega and Accolade settled the case on April 30, 1993. As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released Barkley Shut Up and Jam! while under license.&#91;82&#93; The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public.&#91;83&#93; The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs.&#91;84&#93;
In 1993, the American media began to focus on the mature content of certain video games. Games such as Night Trap for the Sega CD, an add-on, received unprecedented scrutiny. Issues about Night Trap were brought up in the United Kingdom, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that "Night Trap got Sega an awful lot of publicity ;... it was also cited in UK Parliament for being classified as '15' due to its use of real actors."&#91;85&#93; This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only reinforced that image.&#91;24&#93; By far the year's most controversial game was Midway's Mortal Kombat, ported to the Genesis and SNES by Acclaim Entertainment. In response to public outcry over the game's graphic violence, Nintendo decided to replace the blood in the game with "sweat" and the arcade's gruesome "fatalities" with less violent finishing moves.&#91;86&#93; Sega took a different approach, instituting America's first video game ratings system, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC), for all its current systems. Ratings ranged from the family-friendly GA rating to the more mature rating of MA-13, and the adults-only rating of MA-17.&#91;86&#93; With the rating system in place, Sega released its version of Mortal Kombat, appearing to have removed all the blood and sweat effects and toning down the finishing moves even more than in the SNES version. However, all the arcade's blood and uncensored finishing moves could be enabled by entering a "Blood Code". This technicality allowed Sega to release the game with a relatively low MA-13 rating.&#91;87&#93; Meanwhile, the tamer SNES version shipped without a rating.&#91;87&#93;
The Genesis version of Mortal Kombat was well-received by gaming press, as well as fans, outselling the SNES version three- or four-to-one,&#91;86&#93;&#91;88&#93;&#91;89&#93; while Nintendo was criticized for censoring the SNES version of the game.&#91;87&#93; Executive vice president of Nintendo of America Howard Lincoln was quick to point out at the hearings that Night Trap had no such rating, saying to Senator Joe Lieberman:
In response, Sega of America vice president Bill White showed a videotape of violent video games on the SNES and stressed the importance of rating video games. At the end of the hearing, Lieberman called for another hearing in February 1994 to check on progress toward a rating system for video game violence.&#91;86&#93;
As a result of the congressional hearings, Night Trap started to generate more sales and released ports to the PC, Sega 32X, and 3DO. According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, "You know, I sold 50,000 units of Night Trap a week after those hearings."&#91;86&#93; Although experiencing increased sales, Sega decided to recall Night Trap and re-release it with revisions in 1994 due to the congressional hearings.&#91;90&#93; After the close of these hearings, video game manufacturers came together to establish the rating system that Lieberman had called for. Initially, Sega proposed the universal adoption of its system, but after objections by Nintendo and others, Sega took a role in forming a new one. This became the Entertainment Software Rating Board, an independent organization that received praise from Lieberman.&#91;86&#93; With this new rating system in place for the 1994 holiday season, Nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed, and the SNES port of Mortal Kombat II was released uncensored.&#91;87&#93;
In order to extend the life of the Genesis, Sega released two add-ons to increase its capabilities: a CD-based peripheral known as the Sega CD (Mega-CD outside North America), and a 32-bit peripheral known as the Sega 32X.&#91;71&#93; Worldwide 2.24 ;million Sega CD units were sold,&#91;91&#93; and 800,000 32X units.&#91;92&#93;
Following the launch of the next-generation 32-bit Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, sales of 16-bit hardware and software continued to account for 64% of the video game market in 1995.&#91;93&#93; Sega underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis and did not have the inventory to meet the demand for the product.&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93; Sega was able to capture 43% of the dollar share of the U.S. video game market and claimed to have sold more than two million Genesis units in 1995, while Genesis software such as Vectorman remained highly successful, but Kalinske estimated that "we could have sold another 300,000 Genesis systems in the November/December timeframe."&#91;94&#93; Nakayama's decision to focus on the Saturn over the Genesis, based on the systems' relative performance in Japan, has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation.&#91;93&#93; By contrast, Nintendo concentrated on the 16-bit home console market, as well as its successful handheld, the Game Boy. As a result, Nintendo took in 42% of the video game market dollar share, without launching a 32-bit console to compete directly with the PlayStation or the Saturn.&#91;93&#93; Following tensions with Sega Enterprises, Ltd. over its focus on the Saturn, Kalinske, who oversaw the rise of the Genesis in 1991, grew uninterested in the business and resigned in mid-1996.&#91;95&#93;
Sega sold 30.75 ;million Genesis units worldwide.&#91;96&#93; Of these, 3.58 ;million were sold in Japan,&#91;91&#93; and sales in Europe and the U.S. are roughly estimated at 8 ;million&#91;97&#93; and 18–18.5 ;million as of June 1997 (at which time Sega was no longer manufacturing the system) respectively.&#91;63&#93;&#91;65&#93;&#91;98&#93; In 1998, Sega licensed the Genesis to Majesco Entertainment in North America so it could re-release the console. Majesco began reselling millions of formerly unsold cartridges at a budget price, together with 150,000 units of the second model of the Genesis.&#91;63&#93; It released the Genesis 3,&#91;99&#93; projecting to sell 1.5 ;million units of the console by the end of 1998.&#91;63&#93; Tectoy continues to sell emulated variants of the original hardware and has sold an estimated 3 ;million Genesis units, including variants, in Brazil.&#91;100&#93;&#91;101&#93;
The main microprocessor is a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 7.6 MHz.&#91;102&#93; An 8-bit Zilog Z80 processor controls the sound hardware and provides backward compatibility with the Master System. The system has 72 kB of RAM, 64 kB of video RAM, and can display up to 61 colors&#91;103&#93; at once from a palette of 512. The games are in ROM cartridge format and inserted in the top.&#91;104&#93;
The system produces sound using a Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG, integrated with the Video Display Processor (VDP), and a Yamaha YM2612 FM synthesizer chip. The Z80 processor is primarily used to control both sound chips to produce stereo music and sound effects. Most revisions of the original system contain a discrete YM2612 and a separate YM7101 VDP; the functionality of these chips was integrated into a single custom ASIC (FC1004) for the model 2 and later revisions.&#91;104&#93;
The back of the model 1 console provides a radio frequency output port (designed for use with antenna and cable systems) and a specialized 8-pin DIN port, which both provide video and audio output. Both outputs produce monophonic sound; a headphone jack on the front of the console produces stereo sound.&#91;105&#93; On the model 2, the DIN port, radio frequency output port, and headphone jack are replaced by a 9-pin mini-DIN port on the back for composite video, RGB and stereo sound, and the standard RF switch.&#91;106&#93; Earlier model 1 consoles have a 9-pin extension port, although this was removed in later production runs. An edge connector on the bottom right of the console can be connected to a peripheral.&#91;107&#93;
The standard  controller features a rounded shape, a directional pad, three main buttons, and a "start" button. In 1993, Sega released a slightly smaller pad with three additional face buttons, similar to the design of buttons on some popular arcade fighting games such as Street Fighter II. Sega also released a wireless revision of the six-button controller, the Remote Arcade Pad.&#91;108&#93;
The  system is backward compatible with the Master System. The first peripheral released, the Power Base Converter (Master System Converter in Europe), allows Master System games to be played.&#91;109&#93; A second model, the Master System Converter 2, was released only in Europe for use with the Mega Drive II.&#91;108&#93;
Other peripherals were released to add functionality. The Menacer is a wireless, infrared light gun peripheral used with compatible games.&#91;109&#93; Other third parties created light gun peripherals for the Genesis, such as the American Laser Games Pistol and the Konami Justifier. Released for art creation software, the Sega Mega Mouse features three buttons and is only compatible with a few games, such as Eye of the Beholder. A foam-covered bat called the BatterUP and the TeeVGolf golf club were released for both the  Genesis and SNES.&#91;108&#93;
In November 1993, Sega released the Sega Activator, an octagonal device that lies flat on the floor and was designed to translate the player's physical movements into game inputs.&#91;108&#93;&#91;110&#93; Several high-profile games, including Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition, were adapted to support the peripheral. The device was a commercial failure, due mainly to its inaccuracy and its high price point.&#91;108&#93;&#91;111&#93; IGN editor Craig Harris ranked the Sega Activator the third worst video game controller ever made.&#91;112&#93;
Both EA and Sega released multitaps to allow more than the standard two players to play at once. Initially, EA's version, the 4 Way Play, and Sega's adapter, the Team Player, only supported each publisher's games. In response to complaints about this, Sega publicly stated, "We have been working hard to resolve this problem since we learned of it", and that a new Team Player which would work with all multitap games for the console would be released shortly.&#91;113&#93; Later games were created to work on both the 4 Way Play and Team Player.&#91;108&#93; Codemasters also developed the J-Cart system, providing two extra ports on the cartridge itself, although the technology came late in the console's life and is only featured on a few games.&#91;114&#93; Sega planned to release a steering wheel peripheral in 1994, and the Genesis version of Virtua Racing was advertised as being "steering wheel compatible," but the peripheral was cancelled.&#91;115&#93;
In its first foray into online gaming, Sega created Sega Meganet, which debuted in Japan on November 3, 1990. Operating through a cartridge and a peripheral called the "Mega Modem," this allowed Mega Drive players to play a total of seventeen games online. A North American version, dubbed "Tele-Genesis," was announced but never released,&#91;116&#93; though a version was operated in Brazil starting in 1995.&#91;36&#93; Another phone-based system, the Mega Anser, turned the Japanese Mega Drive into an online banking terminal.&#91;22&#93;
In 1994, Sega started the Sega Channel, a game distribution system using cable television services Time Warner Cable and TCI. Using a special peripheral, Genesis players could download a game from a library of fifty each month and demos for upcoming releases. Games were downloaded to internal memory and deleted when the console was powered off. The Sega Channel reached 250,000 subscribers at its peak and ran until July 31, 1998, well past the release of the Sega Saturn.&#91;116&#93;
In an effort to compete with Sega, third-party developer Catapult Entertainment created the XBAND, a peripheral which allowed Genesis players to engage in online competitive gaming. Using telephone services to share data, XBAND was initially offered in five U.S. cities in November 1994. The following year, the service was extended to the SNES, and Catapult teamed up with Blockbuster Video to market the service, but as interest in the service waned, it was discontinued in April 1997.&#91;117&#93;
The Genesis library was initially modest, but eventually grew to contain games to appeal to all types of players. The initial pack-in game was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991.&#91;22&#93; Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog, its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Disney's Aladdin.&#91;2&#93; During development for the console, Sega Enterprises focused on developing action games, while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A large part of the appeal of the Genesis library during the console's lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, as well as more difficult entries such as Ecco the Dolphin, and sports games such as Joe Montana Football.&#91;22&#93; Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat.&#91;22&#93;
Notably, the arcade hit Street Fighter II by Capcom initially skipped the Genesis, instead only being released on the SNES. However, as the Genesis continued to grow in popularity, Capcom eventually ported a version of Street Fighter II to the system known as Street Fighter II: Champion Edition,&#91;118&#93; that would go on to sell over a million copies.&#91;119&#93; One of the biggest third-party companies to support the Genesis early on was Electronic Arts. Trip Hawkins, founder and then president of EA, believed the faster drawing speed of the Genesis made it more suitable for sport games than the SNES, and credits EA's success on the Genesis for helping catapult the EA Sports brand.&#91;120&#93; Another third-party blockbuster for the system was the port of the original Mortal Kombat. Although the arcade game was released on the SNES and Genesis simultaneously, the two ports were not identical. The SNES version looked closer to the arcade game, but the Genesis version allowed players to bypass censorship, helping make it more popular.&#91;121&#93; In 1997, Sega of America claimed the Genesis had a software attach rate of 16 games sold per console, double that of the SNES.&#91;122&#93;
On the Super NES, companies could add enhancement chips to cartridges to increase the console's capabilities and produce more advanced graphics; for example, the launch game Pilotwings contained a digital signal processor. Later, the Super FX chip was designed to offload complex rendering tasks from the main CPU. It was first used in Star Fox, which renders 3D polygons in real-time, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island demonstrates rotation, scaling, and stretching of individual sprites and manipulates large areas of the screen.&#91;123&#93;
Sega began work on an enhancement chip to compete with the Super FX, resulting in the Sega Virtua Processor. This chip enables the Genesis to render polygons in real time and provides an "Axis Transformation" unit that handles scaling and rotation. Virtua Racing, the only game released with this chip, runs at a significantly higher and more stable frame rate than similar games on the SNES.&#91;123&#93; The chip was expensive to produce, and increased the cost of the games that used it. At US$100, Virtua Racing was the most expensive Genesis cartridge ever produced. Two other games, Virtua Fighter and Daytona USA, were planned for the SVP chip, but were instead moved into the Saturn's launch line-up.&#91;123&#93; There were plans to sell the SVP chip as a separate upgrade module for the Genesis,&#91;124&#93;&#91;125&#93; but this module was never released.&#91;123&#93;
In addition to accessories such as the Power Base Converter, the Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format.&#91;126&#93; The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges and serves as a pass-through for Genesis games.&#91;127&#93; Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters.&#91;128&#93; Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.&#91;61&#93;&#91;126&#93;&#91;127&#93;
By 1991, compact discs had gained in popularity as a data storage device for music and software. PCs and video game companies had started to make use of this technology. NEC had been the first to include CD technology in a game console with the release of the TurboGrafx-CD add-on, and Nintendo was making plans to develop its own CD peripheral as well. Seeing the opportunity to gain an advantage over its rivals, Sega partnered with JVC to develop a CD-ROM add-on for the Genesis.&#91;4&#93;&#91;129&#93;&#91;130&#93; Sega launched the Mega-CD in Japan&#91;4&#93; on December 1, 1991, initially retailing at JP¥49,800.&#91;131&#93; The CD add-on was launched in North America on October 15, 1992, as the Sega CD, with a retail price of US$299;&#91;4&#93; it was released in Europe as the Mega-CD in 1993.&#91;131&#93; In addition to greatly expanding the potential size of its games, this add-on unit upgraded the graphics and sound capabilities by adding a second, more powerful processor, more system memory, and hardware-based scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games.&#91;4&#93;&#91;132&#93; It provided battery-backed storage RAM to allow games to save high scores, configuration data, and game progress.&#91;129&#93;
Shortly after its launch in North America, Sega began shipping the Sega CD with the pack-in game Sewer Shark, a full motion video (FMV) game developed by Digital Pictures, a company that became an important partner for Sega.&#91;4&#93; Touting the benefits of the CD's comparatively vast storage space, Sega and its third-party developers produced a number of games for the add-on that include digital video in their gameplay or as bonus content, as well as re-releasing several cartridge-based games with high-fidelity audio tracks.&#91;126&#93;&#91;129&#93; In 1993, Sega released the Sega CD 2, a smaller and lighter version of the add-on designed for the Genesis II, at a reduced price compared to the original.&#91;126&#93; A limited number of games were later developed that use both the Sega CD and the Sega 32X add-ons.&#91;133&#93;
The Mega-CD sold only 100,000 units during its first year in Japan, falling well below expectations. Although many consumers blamed its high launch price, it also suffered from a tiny software library; only two games were available at launch. This was due in part to the long delay before Sega made its software development kit available to third-party developers.&#91;131&#93; Sales were higher in North America and Europe, although the novelty of FMV and CD-enhanced games quickly wore off, as many later games were met with lukewarm or negative reviews. In 1995, Sega announced a shift in focus to its new console, the Saturn, and discontinued advertising for Genesis hardware. The Sega CD sold 2.24 ;million units worldwide.&#91;91&#93;
With the release of the Saturn scheduled for 1995, Sega began developing a stopgap to bridge the gap between the Genesis and Saturn and serve as a less expensive entry into the 32-bit era.&#91;134&#93; At the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994, Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller took a phone call from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of a quick response to the Atari Jaguar. One idea came from a concept from Sega Enterprises, "Project Jupiter," a new standalone console.&#91;135&#93; Project Jupiter was initially planned as  a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the Saturn, and limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip. Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.&#91;136&#93; At the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit SuperH-2 processors.&#91;137&#93; The SH-2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company Hitachi.&#91;138&#93; At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega Enterprises invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.&#91;136&#93;
Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games.&#91;137&#93; Before the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America. Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously. Their answer was to call the 32X a "transitional device" between the Genesis and the Saturn.&#91;135&#93; This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.&#91;127&#93;
The 32X was released in November 1994, in time for the holiday season. Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up orders for the system.&#91;137&#93; More than 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995.&#91;127&#93; Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch.&#91;134&#93; Though positioning the console as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. After an early run on the peripheral, news soon spread to the public of the upcoming release of the Sega Saturn, which would not support the 32X's games. The Saturn was released on May 11, 1995,&#91;139&#93; four months earlier than its originally intended release date of September 2, 1995.&#91;140&#93; The Saturn, in turn, caused developers to further shy away from the console and created doubt about the library for the 32X, even with Sega's assurances that there would be a large number of games developed for the system. In early 1996, Sega conceded that it had promised too much out of the 32X and decided to stop producing the system in order to focus on the Saturn.&#91;127&#93; Prices for the 32X dropped to $99 and cleared out of stores at $19.95.&#91;137&#93;
More than a dozen licensed variations of the Genesis/Mega Drive have been released.&#91;141&#93; In addition to models made by Sega, alternate models were made by other companies, such as Majesco Entertainment, AtGames, JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Amstrad, and Aiwa. A number of bootleg clones were created during its lifespan.&#91;22&#93;
In 1993, Sega introduced a smaller, lighter version of the console,&#91;104&#93; known as the Mega Drive 2 in Japan, Europe, and Australia&#91;d&#93; and simply sold as Genesis (without the Sega prefix) in North America. This version omits the headphone jack in the front, replaces the A/V-Out connector with a smaller version that supports stereo sound, and provides a simpler, less expensive mainboard that requires less power.&#91;107&#93;
Sega released a combined, semi-portable Genesis/Sega CD unit called the Genesis CDX (marketed as the Multi-Mega in Europe). This unit retailed at $399.95 in the U.S.&#91;142&#93; (roughly $100 more than the individual Genesis and Sega CD units put together, since the Sega CD dropped its price to $229 half a year before&#91;143&#93;), and was bundled with Sonic CD, Sega Classics Arcade Collection, and the Sega CD version of Ecco the Dolphin.&#91;144&#93; The CDX features a small LCD screen that, when the unit is used to play audio CDs, displays the current track being played.&#91;145&#93; With this feature and the system's lightweight build (weighing two pounds), Sega marketed it in part as a portable CD player.&#91;142&#93;
Late in the 16-bit era, Sega released a handheld version of the Genesis called the Genesis Nomad. Its design was based on the Mega Jet, a Mega Drive portable unit featured on airplane flights in Japan. As the only successor to the Game Gear, the Nomad operates on 6 AA batteries, displaying its graphics on a 3.25-inch (8.25-mm) LCD screen. The Nomad supports the entire Genesis library, but cannot be used with the Sega 32X, the Sega CD, or the Power Base Converter.&#91;146&#93;
Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high quality audio, the Wondermega's high price ($500 at launch&#91;147&#93;) kept it out of the hands of average consumers.&#91;148&#93; The same was true of the Pioneer LaserActive, which requires an add-on known as the Mega-LD pack, developed by Sega, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Although the LaserActive was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the combined price of the system and the Mega-LD pack made it a prohibitively expensive option for Sega players.&#91;149&#93; Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox. Several companies added the Mega Drive to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the MSX models AX-330 and AX-990, distributed in Kuwait and Yemen, and the Amstrad Mega PC, distributed in Europe and Australia.&#91;22&#93;
After the Genesis was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released the Genesis 3 as a budget version in 1998.&#91;150&#93; A similar thing happened in Portugal, where Ecofilmes, Sega's distributor in the country, obtained a license to sell the Mega Game II. This version was more akin to the second first-party model, being noteworthy the inclusion of six-button controllers and a switch to alternate between different game regions, enabling this version to play all games without the need for any device or modification to bypass region locking.&#91;151&#93; In 2009, AtGames began producing two new variations: the Firecore, which can play original Genesis cartridges as well as preloaded games, and a handheld console preloaded with 20 Genesis games.&#91;152&#93; Companies such as Radica Games have released various compilations of Genesis and Mega Drive games in "plug-and-play" packages resembling the system's controller.&#91;153&#93;
A number of Genesis and Mega Drive emulators have been produced, including GenEM, KGen, Genecyst, VGen, St0rm,&#91;154&#93; and Gens.&#91;155&#93; The GameTap subscription gaming service included a Genesis emulator and had several dozen licensed Genesis games in its catalog.&#91;156&#93; The Console Classix subscription gaming service includes an emulator and has several hundred Genesis games in its catalog.&#91;157&#93;
Compilations of Genesis games have been released for other consoles. These include Sonic Mega Collection and Sonic Gems Collection for PS2, Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube; Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP; and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (known as the Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection in PAL territories) for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&#91;158&#93;&#91;159&#93;
During his keynote speech at the 2006 Game Developers Conference, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata announced that Sega would make a number of Genesis/Mega Drive games available to download on the Wii's Virtual Console.&#91;160&#93; There are select Genesis games available on the Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade, such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic 2,&#91;161&#93; as well as games available via the PlayStation Network&#91;162&#93; and Steam.&#91;163&#93;
On May 22, 2006, North American company Super Fighter Team released Beggar Prince, a game translated from a 1996 Chinese original.&#91;164&#93; It was released worldwide and was the first commercial Genesis game release in North America since 1998.&#91;165&#93; Super Fighter Team would later go on to release two more games for the system, Legend of Wukong and Star Odyssey.&#91;165&#93; In December 2010, WaterMelon, an American company, released Pier Solar and the Great Architects, the first commercial role-playing video game specifically developed for the console since 1996,&#91;166&#93; and the biggest 16-bit game ever produced at 64 Mb.&#91;167&#93; Pier Solar is the only cartridge-based game which can optionally use the Sega CD to play an enhanced soundtrack and sound effects disc.&#91;168&#93; In 2013, independent programmer Future Driver, inspired by the Disney film Wreck-It Ralph, developed Fix-It Felix Jr. for the Genesis.&#91;169&#93; In 2017, American company Mega Cat Games released Coffee Crisis, a Beat 'em up, for the Sega Genesis.&#91;170&#93;
On December 5, 2007, Tectoy released a portable version of the Genesis/Mega Drive with twenty built-in games.&#91;171&#93; Another version called "Mega Drive Guitar Idol" comes with two six-button joypads and a guitar controller with five fret buttons. The Guitar Idol game contains a mix of Brazilian and international songs. The console has 87 built-in games, including some from Electronic Arts based on the mobile phone versions.&#91;172&#93; It was announced that Tectoy has developed a new Genesis console that not only looks almost identical to the original model of the Genesis, but also has a traditional cartridge slot and SD card reader, due for release in June 2017.&#91;173&#93;
In 2009, Chinese company AtGames produced a Genesis/Mega Drive-compatible console, the Firecore.&#91;152&#93; It features a top-loading cartridge slot and includes two controllers similar to the six-button controller for the original Genesis. The console has 15 games built-in and is region-free, allowing cartridge games to run regardless of their region.&#91;174&#93; AtGames produced a handheld version of the console.&#91;175&#93; Both machines have been released in Europe by distributing company Blaze Europe.&#91;174&#93;
In 2018, Sega announced a microconsole, the Genesis/Mega Drive Mini.&#91;176&#93; It will include 40 games, including Gunstar Heroes and Castlevania: Bloodlines, with different games for different regions and a save-anywhere function. Streets of Rage composer Yuzo Koshiro will provide the menu music. The console is planned for release on September 19, 2019.&#91;177&#93;
Reviewing the Genesis in 1995, Game Players noted that its rivalry with the Super NES was skewed by genre, with the Genesis having superior sports games and the Super NES superior RPGs. Commenting that the Genesis hardware was aging and the new software drying up, they recommended consumers buy a next generation system or a Genesis Nomad instead, but also advised those who already owned a Genesis to not sell it.&#91;178&#93; In a 1997 year-end review, a team of five Electronic Gaming Monthly editors gave the Genesis scores of 4.5, 5.0, 4.0, 4.5, and 7.5 - for all five editors, the lowest score they gave to any of the five consoles reviewed in the issue. While their chief criticisms were the lack of upcoming game releases and dated hardware, they also concurred that the Genesis was clearly inferior to the Super NES in terms of graphics capabilities, sound chip, and games library. John Ricciardi in particular considered the Genesis overrated, saying he had consistently found more enjoyment in both the Super NES and TurboGrafx-16, while Dan Hsu and Crispin Boyer recommended it based on its selection of classic titles and the high value-for-money of the six pack-in games Sega was offering at the time.&#91;179&#93;
The Genesis has often ranked among the best video game consoles. In 2009, IGN named it the fifth best video game console, citing its edge in sports games and better home version of Mortal Kombat, and lauding "what some consider to be the greatest controller ever created: the six button".&#91;180&#93; In 2007, GameTrailers named the Genesis as the sixth best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that "left their mark on the history of gaming", noting its great games and solid controller, and writing of the "glory days" of Sonic the Hedgehog.&#91;181&#93; In January 2008, technology columnist Don Reisinger proclaimed that the Genesis "created the industry's best console war to date", citing Sonic the Hedgehog, superior sports games, and backward compatibility with the Sega Master System.&#91;182&#93; In 2008, GamingExcellence ranked it sixth of the 10 best consoles, declaring, "one can truly see the Genesis for the gaming milestone it was."&#91;183&#93; At the same time, GameDaily rated it ninth of ten for its memorable games.&#91;184&#93;
In 2014, USgamer's Jeremy Parish wrote, "If the Atari generation introduced video games as a short-lived '70s fad ;... and the NES generation established it into an enduring obsession for the young, Sega's Genesis began pushing the medium toward something resembling its contemporary form", expounding that the system served as "the key incubator for modern sports franchises", made "consoles truly international" by providing Western third-parties previously put at a disadvantage by Nintendo's restrictive licensing policies with a more profitable alternative, created "an online subscription service" that foreshadowed "PlayStation Plus more than 15 years early" with the Sega Channel, and "played a key role in ensuring the vitality and future of the games industry by breaking Nintendo's near-monopolistic hold on the U.S. and awakening the U.K. to the merits of television gaming".&#91;185&#93;
For his part, Kalinske highlighted Sega's role in developing games for an older demographic and pioneering "the concept of the 'street date'" with the simultaneous North American and European release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.&#91;186&#93;&#91;187&#93; John Sczepaniak of Retro Gamer noted, "It was a system where the allure was born not only of the hardware and games, but the magazines, playground arguments, climate, and politics of the time."&#91;22&#93; Sega of America's marketing campaign for the Genesis was widely emulated, influencing marketing in the subsequent generation of consoles.&#91;188&#93;

Sonic the Hedgehog&#91;a&#93; is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis home video game console. It was released in North America in June 1991 and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. The game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the powerful Chaos Emeralds. The gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health, and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.
Development began in 1990 when Sega ordered its developers to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves "Sonic Team" to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by Super Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by programmer Yuji Naka.
Sonic the Hedgehog was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16-bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. The game has been ported a number of times, and inspired several clones, a successful franchise, and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.
Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling–platform video game. The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops.&#91;2&#93; The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals.  Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game.&#91;3&#93; The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents.&#91;4&#93; Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground.&#91;5&#93;
At the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Signposts act as checkpoints to allow Sonic to return to the most recently activated post when he loses a life.&#91;6&#93; The time resets when he returns to the checkpoint.&#91;7&#93; The game ends when the player runs out of lives,&#91;8&#93; although the player may return to the beginning of the act with three lives if the player has any continues.&#91;7&#93;
Scattered around each level are gold rings.&#91;5&#93; Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life.&#91;5&#93; Rings act as a layer of protection against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, all his rings will scatter.&#91;3&#93; He can recollect some of them again before they disappear. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life.&#91;5&#93; Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, bottomless pits, or running out of time, kill Sonic regardless of rings or other protection.&#91;2&#93;
The game is split into six principal zones, followed by a short 'Final Zone'.  Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles.&#91;9&#93; Each main zone is split into three acts,&#91;2&#93;&#91;4&#93; all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a boss fight.  For most of the fights, Robotnik's vehicle is fitted with different weapons.&#91;10&#93; After completing the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the single-level "Final Zone" for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment.&#91;7&#93;  Destroying Robotnik's machine ends the game.  A brief animation shows Sonic's return to the first zone, with animals liberated from Dr. Robotnik.
Optionally, if Sonic reaches the end of any zone's Act 1 or Act 2 while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a "special stage". In the Special Stages, Sonic is continually curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze. In these levels, the player earns a number of continues for each multiple of 50 rings collected, but the main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald hidden within the maze.  Colliding with any of the blocks marked "GOAL" ends the level.&#91;4&#93;&#91;11&#93;
In an attempt to steal the six Chaos Emeralds and harness their power, the evil Dr. Ivo Robotnik&#91;b&#93; has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself.&#91;2&#93; If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. If all the emeralds are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the Chaos Emeralds not collected by the player.&#91;7&#93;
In 1990, Sega ordered its in-house development studio to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company.&#91;2&#93;&#91;12&#93; Sega president Hayao Nakayama wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse. Sega had competition with Nintendo, who was dominant at the time (particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3),&#91;13&#93; and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry.&#91;2&#93; Although the company had some limited success with Genesis ports of its arcade games, it knew this would not be enough.&#91;13&#93;
The team developed ideas for characters, an engine, and gameplay mechanics. Development emphasized speed, so Sega eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals, as well as fast creatures like kangaroos and squirrels.&#91;2&#93; One idea, a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware. The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball, their idea for an attacking move. Designers then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough, so they focused on two animals with spikes: armadillos and hedgehogs.&#91;13&#93; The hedgehog character, first proposed by Naoto Ohshima,&#91;12&#93; prevailed, although the armadillo would later become the basis for Mighty the Armadillo, who later appeared in 1993's SegaSonic the Hedgehog.&#91;2&#93; Ohshima has since admitted that he created Sonic's basic design by combining Felix the Cat's head with Mickey Mouse's body.&#91;14&#93; Ohshima explained that his inspiration for creating Sonic was Sega wanting a game that would be successful in the United States and a new mascot concurrently. He was working with Naka with a prototype game, and Ohshima was thinking of design ideas with the toy and stationery department. Before Sonic was chosen, other characters, including a rabbit and a bearded man who would ultimately become Dr. Robotnik, were created. One summer, Ohshima went on vacation to New York, taking sketches with him. He went to Central Park and asked locals for their opinions on them, and Sonic was the favorite. Ohshima explained that this was because he wanted support for his ideas.
Sonic was originally teal-colored,&#91;12&#93; then a light shade of blue, but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds&#91;15&#93; and to match the Sega logo. His shoes had buckles through the inspiration of Michael Jackson's boots on the album cover for Bad and the red and white color scheme of Santa Claus, whom Ohshima saw as the most "famous character in the world".&#91;12&#93; Sonic's spikes were emphasized to make him look sleeker, and he was given the ability to spin while jumping (so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button).&#91;16&#93; The new character was originally named "Mr. Needlemouse", but the eight-member team&#91;17&#93; changed his name to "Sonic" and took the name Sonic Team.&#91;13&#93;&#91;c&#93; Ohshima stated that "Sonic" was chosen because it represented speed.&#91;19&#93; Ideas proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna,&#91;20&#93; but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple. Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a hedgehog is and initially proposed a full-scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes.&#91;12&#93; The antagonist ended up being named "Dr. Eggman" in Japan and "Dr. Robotnik" in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega's American and Japanese divisions.&#91;14&#93;
With a satisfying protagonist completed, Sega turned to programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them through his work on Phantasy Star and the Genesis port of Ghouls 'n Ghosts.&#91;12&#93; Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but desired something faster, so the game was made to play quickly,&#91;21&#93; which was where he focused most of his effort.&#91;22&#93; Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game is because he ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow.&#91;23&#93;
Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by a team of seven: two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers,&#91;23&#93; although it began with just Naka and Ohshima.&#91;19&#93; People came onto the team as the need for content increased.&#91;19&#93; After being assigned a project with the code name "Defeat Mario", Naka and Ohshima began work, but encountered problems: Ohshima's Rabbit proved hard to program. Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. Hirokazu Yasuhara came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up.&#91;24&#93;
Due to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down.&#91;24&#93;
The gameplay originated with a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. Naka's prototype was a platform game with a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima's character designs and levels by Yasuhara.&#91;25&#93; Yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design.&#91;12&#93; The color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California.&#91;12&#93;
In designing the gameplay, Naka was inspired by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series;&#91;27&#93; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.&#91;12&#93;
Naka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months.&#91;25&#93; Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis' technological prowess, the game underwent extensive testing and redesign, which took over six months. According to Naka, the game had the fastest-ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that had been considered impossible on the console.&#91;27&#93;
The team intended to add a two-player mode displayed via split-screen, but Naka's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement it. A two-player mode appeared in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992), whereby the second player controls Sonic's sidekick Miles "Tails" Prower.&#91;12&#93; Sonic Team also intended to include a sound test with animations of Sonic breakdancing to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as Vector the Crocodile in Knuckles' Chaotix in 1995.&#91;28&#93; The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the "Se-ga!" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound.&#91;28&#93;
Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code.&#91;14&#93; Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch.&#91;22&#93;&#91;24&#93; He stated that he found the process "very interesting".&#91;22&#93; Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards.&#91;23&#93; The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty.&#91;29&#93;
Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes.&#91;24&#93;
Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Yūzō Kayama write the Sonic score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True.&#91;12&#93;&#91;30&#93; Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. Nakamura said the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it "impossible". He wrote the soundtrack concurrently with the Dreams Come True album Million Kisses.&#91;24&#93;
On October 19, 2011, over 20 years after the release, a three-disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan. The first disc features original tracks from both games, the second contains Nakamura's demo recordings before they were programmed into the Genesis, and the third has songs by Dreams Come True and their associated Akon remixes.&#91;31&#93;
Game-package illustrator Akira Watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters "colorful", using clear lines and gradation to "finish them neatly".&#91;32&#93; According to Watanabe, the developers asked him to create a package design "similar to pop art ;... without being particular to conventional packages" – something "original" and "stylish".&#91;32&#93; The game was not revealed until the January 1991 International Consumer Electronics Show because Sega wanted to wait until the right time and because they saw an opportunity to "steal the show". At the show, Sonic the Hedgehog was believed to be the most impressive game shown, and won the CES award for innovation.&#91;33&#93;
Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted reassurance that the character would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show.&#91;34&#93; It was released in North America on June 23, 1991,&#91;27&#93; and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles,&#91;37&#93; replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units.&#91;33&#93; Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail.&#91;27&#93; Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign, promoting Sonic as its mascot.&#91;12&#93;
A version of Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Ancient and released in late 1991 for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear. Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the 16-bit version, though some level themes and digital assets are different and Chaos Emeralds are scattered throughout levels rather than special stages.&#91;38&#93; Gameplay as a whole is simplified; the level design is flatter and has a larger focus on exploration, with no vertical loops, and Sonic cannot re-collect his rings after being hit.&#91;39&#93; The game has a different soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro, which includes adaptations of music from the original version.&#91;40&#93; It was the final game released for the Master System in North America.&#91;41&#93; The Master System version was re-released for Wii's Virtual Console service in North America and Europe in August 2008.&#91;39&#93;&#91;42&#93; The Game Gear version was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on June 13, 2013,&#91;43&#93; and included as an unlockable game in Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut for GameCube and Windows&#91;44&#93; and Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows.&#91;45&#93;
To mark the game's fifteenth anniversary, a port for the Game Boy Advance, Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was released on November 14, 2006. While the port is mostly identical to the original, it includes several new features not seen in the original Genesis release, such as the ability to save game progress and the inclusion of the Spin Dash move.&#91;46&#93; This version, unlike others, received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of 33/100.&#91;47&#93; The chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance, resulting in a bad performance and poor implementation of the original music and gameplay.&#91;48&#93;
As a response to the poor reception and claims that the system could not handle the original game, Simon “Stealth” Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system. The unofficial version contains a complete Green Hill Zone and two special stages, as well as Tails and Knuckles as playable characters.&#91;49&#93;
A remastered mobile port was released on iOS on May 15, 2013, with an Android version following the next day. This version was developed by Christian "Taxman" Whitehead and Simon Thomley of Headcannon from scratch using the Retro Engine, previously used in the 2011 remaster of Sonic CD. This port features several enhancements, such as widescreen graphics, the optional ability to Spin Dash, an additional special stage, a time attack mode, and the unlockable option to play as Tails or Knuckles; it additionally features a heavily expanded debug mode which allows for use of unused elements and elements from more recent games (such as the characters' super forms).&#91;50&#93;&#91;51&#93; The iOS version was updated in 2016, adding compatibility with Apple TV.&#91;52&#93;
A Nintendo 3DS version, 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was released as part of the 3D Classics line in 2013.&#91;53&#93; This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the code was restructured to take advantage of the 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start from any level.&#91;54&#93;
With its sequels for the Genesis, Sonic the Hedgehog has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers through compilations.&#91;55&#93; The first collection it appeared in was Sonic Compilation (1995) for the Genesis.&#91;56&#93; It has since appeared in Sonic Jam (1997) for the Sega Saturn,&#91;57&#93; Sonic Mega Collection (2002) for the Nintendo GameCube,&#91;58&#93; Sonic Mega Collection Plus (2004) for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox,&#91;45&#93; Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PSP, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (2009) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,&#91;59&#93; Sonic Classic Collection (2010) for the Nintendo DS,&#91;55&#93; Oculus Arcade for the Oculus Rift,&#91;60&#93; and Sega Genesis Classics (2018) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.
Sonic the Hedgehog has been available for all three major seventh-generation video game consoles. It was part of the Wii Virtual Console at the service's 2006 introduction,&#91;2&#93; and was released for the Xbox Live Arcade&#91;61&#93; and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards.&#91;62&#93; The game was released for the iPod Classic, iPod video, and video-capable iPod Nano models in 2007&#91;63&#93; and for Apple's iOS in April 2009.&#91;64&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog became available on GameTap in September 2009.&#91;65&#93; In October 2010, it was released on Windows via Steam.&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93; The game was ported to Android and released in December 2012.&#91;68&#93;&#91;69&#93; Additionally, it is an unlockable reward in the console versions of Sonic Generations.&#91;70&#93; It was also made available on the Sega Forever service on iOS and Android in June 2017.&#91;71&#93; A port for Nintendo Switch was released on September 20, 2018&#91;72&#93; as part of the Sega Ages line of rereleases.&#91;73&#93; It adds features including the ability to use moves from Sonic 2 and Sonic Mania, a challenge mode, a time attack for the first stage, and features from the 3DS rereleases of the game and its sequel.&#91;74&#93;
U.S. Gold acquired the rights to make a version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST personal computers, but these went unreleased.&#91;75&#93; Several screenshots exist, some of which resemble the 8-bit version.&#91;76&#93; An enhanced port for the Sega CD was also planned, but was scrapped in favor of Sonic CD.&#91;77&#93;
Sonic the Hedgehog was praised by critics, with an 86% rating at the review aggregator GameRankings.&#91;78&#93; It was considered Sega's answer to Nintendo's widely popular Mario series, as it was a platformer featuring the company's mascot.&#91;4&#93;&#91;82&#93; Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster, with brighter colors, and Super Mario World as having more "depth of play".&#91;4&#93; Frank Ladoire of Génération 4 believed Sonic the Hedgehog was part of a new generation of games that demonstrate that the Genesis is capable of "beautiful things" in the technical department.&#91;90&#93;
Reviewers praised the colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme "lively, but never garish", praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis.&#91;4&#93; Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds "eye-popping" and "gorgeous",&#91;85&#93; which was echoed by Mean Machines.&#91;35&#93; The Lessers (Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk) of Dragon claimed the graphics made Sonic a possible contender for the best game of 1991&#91;82&#93; and GameZone called the animation "some of the smoothest and fastest ;... ever seen".&#91;95&#93; Julian Boardman of Raze praised the "colourful and highly detailed" backdrops and "fabulous" sprites.&#91;91&#93; The music and sound effects were also well received; Dragon called them "great",&#91;82&#93; and GameZone "amazing".&#91;95&#93; Rand praised the "catchy" soundtrack, calling some of the sound effects "absolutely brilliant".&#91;4&#93; Although Mean Machines called the songs "vaguely appealing", the sound effects were better appreciated.&#91;35&#93; However, Boardman of Raze considered the music "a little boring".&#91;91&#93;
Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers.&#91;83&#93;&#91;85&#93; The difficulty was disputed, described as "impossible" by Rand&#91;4&#93; and "average" by EGM.&#91;83&#93; Rand said about the gameplay in general that it "plays like a dream";&#91;4&#93; according to GameZone it would enchant players for hours,&#91;95&#93; and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping.&#91;85&#93; Although EGM, Dragon, Paul of Mean Machines and Boardman of Raze praised the level design (especially the hidden rooms),&#91;35&#93;&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93;&#91;91&#93; Paul found losing all of one's rings frustrating.&#91;35&#93;
Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity, and has since been considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Frank Provo of GameSpot described the game as "one of the best platformers of all time", finding that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port "after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up".&#91;48&#93; Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time.&#91;87&#93; Writing in The Guardian, Keith Stuart observed that Sonic the Hedgehog&#39;s emphasis on speed and pinball mechanics dramatically departs from generally accepted precepts of game design, requiring that players "learn through repetition rather than observation" as "the levels aren't designed to be seen or even understood in one playthrough." However, Stuart concluded that "sometimes in Sonic, when you get better, or through sheer luck, things take off, every jump is right, every loop-the-loop is perfect, and you're in the flow, sailing above the game's strange structure ;... Sonic is incorrect game design and yet ;... it's a masterpiece."&#91;96&#93; Mega ranked Sonic as its third-favorite Genesis game,&#91;97&#93; and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th-greatest game of all time.&#91;98&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success; the original Genesis version bundled with the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive hardware had sold over 15 ;million copies by February 2009,&#91;99&#93;&#91;100&#93; and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008.&#91;101&#93; Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A+ and wrote that it was a very fast game, yet never felt chaotic or impossible,&#91;89&#93; and they later named it the best game available in 1991.&#91;102&#93;
Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console's popularity in North America.&#91;13&#93; During October–December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles.&#91;99&#93; Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market.&#91;103&#93;
Sonic the Hedgehog inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots, including Bubsy,&#91;104&#93; Aero the Acro-Bat,&#91;13&#93; James Pond 3,&#91;105&#93; Earthworm Jim,&#91;106&#93; Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel,&#91;107&#93; and Radical Rex.&#91;108&#93; "Animal with attitude" games carried over to the next generation of consoles, with the developers of Crash Bandicoot and Gex citing Sonic as a major inspiration.&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93;&#91;111&#93;
Sonic's success led to an extensive media franchise, with the first of many sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released the following year. It has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond Sega's exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast.&#91;112&#93; The series has ventured from platformers to fighting,&#91;113&#93; racing,&#91;114&#93; role-playing,&#91;115&#93; and sports games,&#91;116&#93; and also expanded into anime,&#91;117&#93; manga,&#91;118&#93; cartoons&#91;117&#93; comic books,&#91;119&#93; novels,&#91;120&#93; and toys.&#91;121&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time,&#91;122&#93; with over 140 ;million copies sold or downloaded worldwide across consoles, PC's, mobile phones and tablets by May 2014.&#91;123&#93; The game's first level, Green Hill Zone, has been seen in later other games, such as Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Generations,&#91;124&#93; Sonic Mania,&#91;125&#93; Sonic Forces, and the Super Smash Bros. series.&#91;126&#93;
The game inspired a number of unofficial variants, including Somari, a pirated Nintendo Entertainment System conversion featuring Nintendo's Mario character in levels from the original Sonic game,&#91;127&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix, a total conversion mod of the original game,&#91;128&#93; and Sonic 1 Boomed, a ROM hack which implements Sonic's redesign from the Sonic Boom animated series.&#91;129&#93;

A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development – the process and related disciplines of creating video games.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks&#91;3&#93; to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support.&#91;4&#93; Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games.&#91;5&#93;
A developer may specialize in a certain video game console (such as Nintendo's Nintendo Switch, Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony's PlayStation 4), or may develop for a number of systems (including personal computers and mobile devices).&#91;citation needed&#93; Video game developers specialize in certain types of games (such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters). Some focus on porting games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software development work in addition to games.
Most video game publishers maintain development studios (such as Electronic Arts's EA Canada, Square Enix's studios, Activision's Radical Entertainment, Nintendo EAD and Sony's Polyphony Digital and Naughty Dog). However, since publishing is still their primary activity they are generally described as "publishers" rather than "developers". Developers may be private as well (such as how Bungie was, the company which developed the Halo series exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox).
In the video game industry, a first-party developer is part of a company which manufactures a video game console and develops exclusively for it. First-party developers may use the name of the company itself (such as Nintendo), have a specific division name (such as Sony's Polyphony Digital) or have been an independent studio before being acquired by the console manufacturer (such as Rare or Naughty Dog).&#91;6&#93; Whether by purchasing an independent studio or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer involves a huge financial investment on the part of the console manufacturer, which is wasted if the developer fails to produce a hit game in a timely manner.&#91;7&#93; However, using first-party developers saves the cost of having to make royalty payments on a game's profits.&#91;7&#93;
Second-party developer is a colloquial term often used by gaming enthusiasts and media to describe game studios who take development contracts from platform holders and produce games exclusive to that platform.&#91;8&#93; As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, second-party developers are usually offered higher royalty rates than third-party developers.&#91;7&#93; These studios may have exclusive publishing agreements (or other business relationships) with the platform holder, but maintain independence so upon completion or termination of their contracts are able to continue developing games. Examples are Insomniac Games (originally a 2nd party for Sony), Remedy Entertainment (originally a 2nd party for Microsoft) and Game Freak (a 2nd party for Nintendo).

A third-party developer may also publish games, or work for a video game publisher to develop a title. Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's design and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.
The business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the publisher verifies that work is progressing quickly enough to meet its deadline and can direct the developer if the game is not meeting expectations. When each milestone is completed (and accepted), the publisher pays the developer an advance on royalties. Successful developers may maintain several teams working on different games for different publishers. Generally, however, third-party developers tend to be small, close-knit teams. Third-party game development is a volatile sector, since small developers may be dependent on income from a single publisher; one canceled game may be devastating to a small developer. Because of this, many small development companies are short-lived.
A common exit strategy for a successful video-game developer is to sell the company to a publisher, becoming an in-house developer. In-house development teams tend to have more freedom in the design and content of a game compared to third-party developers. One reason is that since the developers are employees of the publisher, their interests are aligned with those of the publisher; the publisher may spend less effort ensuring that the developer's decisions do not enrich the developer at the publisher's expense.
Activision in 1979 became the first third-party video game developer,&#91;9&#93; where the term "second-party" originally referred to the consumers.
In recent years, larger publishers have acquired several third-party developers. While these development teams are now technically "in-house", they often continue to operate in an autonomous manner (with their own culture and work practices). For example, Activision acquired Raven (1997); Neversoft (1999), which merged with Infinity Ward in 2014; Z-Axis (2001); Treyarch (2001); Luxoflux (2002); Shaba (2002); Infinity Ward (2003) and Vicarious Visions (2005). All these developers continue operating much as they did before acquisition, the primary differences being exclusivity and financial details. Publishers tend to be more forgiving of their own development teams going over budget (or missing deadlines) than third-party developers.
A developer may not be the primary entity creating a piece of software, usually providing an external software tool which helps organize (or use) information for the primary software product. Such tools may be a database, Voice over IP, or add-in interface software; this is also known as middleware. Examples of this include SpeedTree and Havoc.
Independents are software developers which are not owned by (or dependent on) a single publisher. Some of these developers self-publish their games, relying on the Internet and word of mouth for publicity. Without the large marketing budgets of mainstream publishers, their products may receive less recognition than those of larger publishers such as Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo. With the advent of digital distribution of inexpensive games on game consoles, it is now possible for indie game developers to forge agreements with console manufacturers for broad distribution of their games.
Other indie game developers create game software for a number of video-game publishers on several gaming platforms.&#91;citation needed&#93; In recent years this model has been in decline; larger publishers, such as Electronic Arts and Activision, increasingly turn to internal studios (usually former independent developers acquired for their development needs).&#91;10&#93;
Video game development is usually conducted in a casual business environment, with T-shirts and sandals common work attire. Many workers find this type of environment rewarding and pleasant professionally and personally.&#91;11&#93; However, the industry also requires long working hours from its employees (sometimes to an extent seen as unsustainable).&#91;12&#93; Employee burnout is not uncommon.&#91;13&#93;
An entry-level programmer can make, on average, over $66,000 annually only if they are successful in obtaining a position in a medium to large video game company.&#91;14&#93; An experienced game-development employee, depending on their expertise and experience, averaged roughly $73,000 in 2007.&#91;15&#93; Indie game developers may only earn between $10,000 and $50,000 a year depending on how financially successful their titles are.&#91;16&#93;
In addition to being part of the software industry,&#91;citation needed&#93; game development is also within the entertainment industry; most sectors of the entertainment industry (such as films and television) require long working hours and dedication from their employees, such as willingness to relocate and/or required to develop games that do not appeal to their personal taste. The creative rewards of work in the entertainment business attracts labor to the industry, creating a competitive labor market which demands a high level of commitment and performance from employees. Industry communities, such as the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), are conducting increasing discussions about the problem; they are concerned that working conditions in the industry cause significant deterioration in its employees' quality of life.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93;
Most game-development engineers and artists in the United States are considered salaried employees; as "exempt non-hourly-paid professionals", they are not subject to state laws governing overtime.&#91;22&#93; An exception is California, where software developers are specifically protected by a minimum hourly wage to be considered exempt, which as of 2008 was set to $36 an hour.&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93;
When crunch time does occur, the publisher or developer may help encourage employees by offering "crunch meals" that are delivered to the offices.&#91;25&#93; Once a product is delivered, and the necessity for crunch no longer required, some companies allow their employees to take paid time-off in compensation for the overtime hours they had put in, or may offer salary raises and bonuses for successful completion of the delivery milestone.&#91;26&#93;
Crunch time has been used in the industry but until 2004 was generally not discussed openly. A 2004 survey by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) found only about 3% of respondents did not work any overtime, and of those that did, nearly half were not compensated for overtime.&#91;27&#93; Attention to crunch was brought to the forefront by Erin Hoffman, posting anonymously under the name "EA Spouse", in 2004, describing the working hours her husband had faced at EA.&#91;28&#93; Besides creating discussion within the industry on the effects of a crunch culture, EA faced two class action lawsuits by EA employees, with both ultimately settled with EA paying back the employees by 2006. EA also announced it would reclassify some of its developers as hourly employees eligible for overtime but eliminating their stock options.&#91;27&#93;
A similar situation was brought to light in January 2010, when a collective group of "Rockstar Spouses", the spouses of developers at Rockstar San Diego, posted an open letter criticizing the management of the studio for deteriorating working conditions for their significant others since March 2009, which included excessive crunch time. This was followed by several former Rockstar employees posting similar complaints of their time there.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93; The IGDA considered that Rockstar's working conditions were exploitative and harmful.&#91;31&#93; 
Since these points, some companies in the industry have taken steps to eliminate crunch. In 2004, following Hoffman's blog, the IGDA issues a report on the negative consequences of crunch time on developers and their quality of life.&#91;32&#93; A 2014 IGDA survey found nearly 20% of game developers did not see any crunch, and where there was crunch, the average number of hours worked had dropped from the prior 2004 survey: in 2004, 35% had said they worked between 65 and 80 hours per week, while by 2014, 35% said they had worked from 50 to 65 hours.&#91;27&#93; A 2019 survey of developers by the Game Developers Conference found that nearly half still worked over 40-hour weeks on average with only 12% working more than 50 hours a week on average, though nearly 75% stated they had at least one period where they had worked more than 40 hours in a single week.&#91;33&#93;
However, stories of crunch time still have brought more awareness that crunch remained an accepted practice in the game industry. Families of Rockstar developers for Red Dead Redemption 2 in October 2018 brought forth similar concerns as the prior "Rockstar Spouse" case.&#91;34&#93; Anonymous Epic Games employees speaking to Polygon spoke of crunch time with 70 to 100 hour weeks by some ever since they released Fortnite Battle Royale, which has drawn a playerbase of millions. While these employees were getting overtime pay, there remained issues of health concerns and inability to take time off without it being seen negatively on their performance.&#91;35&#93;
Crunch time may or may not hamper a game's quality. Despite the crunch, both Red Dead Redemption games above were critically praised; similarly, Retro Studios' Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, both which included periods of crunch time,&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93; are also recognized as high-quality games that were critically acclaimed upon release.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; On the other hand, Sonic Team's 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game was rushed in development to meet deadlines for holiday sales that year, suffering in quality, and has become known as one of poorest-received video games.&#91;41&#93; More recent, crunch time at Starbreeze Studios and Overkill Software in developing Overkill's The Walking Dead, principally from multiple switches in game engine requiring nearly full restarts each time, led to a product that was critically panned for its quality and gameplay, and left both studios in financial distress.&#91;42&#93;
Similar to other tech industries, video game developers are typically not unionized. This is a result of the industry being driven more by creativity and innovation rather than production, the lack of distinction between management and employees in the white-collar area, and that the pace at which the industry moves that makes union actions difficult to plan out.&#91;43&#93; However, when situations related to crunch time become prevalent in the news, there have typically been followup discussions towards the potential to form a union.&#91;43&#93; A survey performed by the International Game Developers Association in 2014 found that more than half of the 2,200 developers surveyed favored unionization.&#91;44&#93;
In 2016, voice actors in the Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union doing work for video games struck several major publishers, demanding better royalty payments and provisions related to the safety of their vocal performances, when their union's standard contract was up for renewal. The voice actor strike lasted for over 300 days into 2017 before a new deal was made between SAG-AFTRA and the publishers. While this had some effects on a few games within the industry, it brought to the forefront the question of whether video game developers should unionize.&#91;43&#93;&#91;45&#93;&#91;46&#93;
A grassroots movement, Game Workers Unite, was established around 2017 to discuss and debate issues related to unionization of game developers. The group came to the forefront during the March 2018 Game Developers Conference by holding a roundtable discussion with the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), the professional association for developers. Statements made by the IGDA's current executive director Jen MacLean relating to IGDA's activities had been seen by as anti-union, and Game Workers Unite desired to start a conversation to lay out the need for developers to unionize.&#91;47&#93; In the wake of the sudden near-closure of Telltale Games in September 2018, the movement again called out for the industry to unionize. The movement argued that Telltale had not given any warning to its 250 employees let go, having hired additional staff as recently as a week prior, and left them without pensions or health-care options; it was further argued that the studio considered this a closure rather than layoffs, as to get around failure to notify required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 preceding layoffs.&#91;48&#93; The situation was argued to be "exploitive", as Telltale had been known to force its employees to frequently work under "crunch time" to deliver its games.&#91;49&#93; By the end of 2018, a United Kingdom trade union, Game Workers Unite UK, an affiliate of the Game Workers Unite movement, has been legally established.&#91;50&#93;
A survey of over 4,000 game developers run by the Game Developers Conference in early 2019 found that 47% of respondents felt the video game industry should unionize.&#91;51&#93;
Following Activision Blizzard's financial report for the previous quarter in February 2019, the company said that they would be laying off around 775 employees (about 8% of their workforce) despite having record profits for that quarter. Further calls for unionization came from this news, including the AFL-CIO writing an open letter to video game developers encouraging them to unionize.&#91;52&#93;
Game Workers Unite and the Communications Workers of America established a new campaign to push for unionization of video game developers, the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE), in January 2020. Initial efforts for CODE were aimed to determine what approach to unionization would be best suited for the video game industry. Whereas some video game employees believes they should follow the craft-based model used by SAG-AFTRA which would unionized based on job function, others feel an industry-wide union, regardless of job position, would be better.&#91;53&#93;
In 1989, according to Variety, women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry.&#91;54&#93; In 2013, Gary Carr (the creative director of Lionhead Studios) predicted that within the next 5 to 10 years, the games development workforce would be 50% female.&#91;54&#93; According to Gamasutra's Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made. Game designing women had the closest equity, making 96 cents for every dollar men made in the same job, while audio professional women had the largest gap, making 68% of what men in the same position made.&#91;55&#93;

Sonic the Hedgehog&#91;a&#93; is a video game series and media franchise created and owned by Sega. The franchise follows Sonic, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who battles the evil Doctor Eggman, a mad scientist. The main Sonic the Hedgehog games are platformers mostly developed by Sonic Team; other games, developed by various studios, include spin-offs in the racing, fighting, party and sports genres. The franchise also incorporates printed media, animations, a 2020 feature film, and merchandise.
The first Sonic game, released in 1991 for the Sega Genesis, was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with Nintendo's mascot Mario. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the 16-bit era of the early 1990s. Sega Technical Institute developed the next three Sonic games in addition to Sonic Spinball (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful Saturn era, the first major 3D Sonic game, Sonic Adventure, was released in 1998 for the Dreamcast. Sega exited the console market and shifted to third-party development in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation systems.
While Sonic games often have unique game mechanics and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based health system, locations, and speedy gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a large cast of characters; some, such as Miles "Tails" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, and Shadow the Hedgehog, have starred in spin-offs. The franchise has also been represented in crossovers such as Sega All-Stars and Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series.
Sonic the Hedgehog is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the bestselling video game franchises, grossing over $5 billion by 2014 and selling 140 ;million by 2016. Series sales and free-to-play mobile game downloads totaled 920 ;million by 2019. The Genesis Sonic games have been described as representative of the culture of the 1990s and listed among the greatest of all time. Although later games have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality compared to earlier installments, Sonic is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.
In 1990, Sega of Japan president Hayao Nakayama decided Sega needed a flagship series and mascot to compete with Nintendo's Mario series. Nintendo had recently released Super Mario Bros. 3, at the time the bestselling video game ever. Sega's strategy had been based on porting its successful arcade games to its 16-bit console, the Genesis; however, Nakayama recognized that Sega needed a star character in a game that could demonstrate the power of the Genesis's hardware.&#91;1&#93; An internal contest was held to determine a flagship game and company mascot,&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93; with a specific focus on the American audience.&#91;4&#93; Among the various teams working on proposals were artist Naoto Ohshima and programmer Yuji Naka.&#91;5&#93;:20–33; 96–101 The gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog (1991) originated with a tech demo created by Naka, who had developed an algorithm that allowed a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. Naka's prototype was a platform game that involved a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube.&#91;6&#93; Sega management accepted the duo's project and they were joined by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara.&#91;5&#93;:20–33; 96–101&#91;7&#93;
After Yashura joined Naka and Ohshima, their focus shifted to the protagonist, who Sega hoped could become its mascot.&#91;5&#93;:20–33; 96–101 The protagonist was initially a rabbit able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, but the concept proved too complex for available hardware. The team moved on to animals that could roll into a ball, and eventually settled on Sonic, a teal hedgehog created by Ohshima.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; Naka's prototype was then fleshed out with Ohshima's character design and levels conceived by Yasuhara.&#91;6&#93; Sonic's color was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes evolved from a design inspired by Michael Jackson's boots; the red and white shoe color was inspired by Santa Claus and the cover of Jackson's 1987 album Bad. His personality was based on Bill Clinton's "can-do" attitude.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; The antagonist, Doctor Eggman, was another character Ohshima had designed for the contest. The development team thought the abandoned design was excellent and retooled the character into a villain.&#91;12&#93; The team took the name Sonic Team for the game's release.&#91;13&#93;
Although Sega of America CEO Michael Katz was certain that Sonic would not catch on with American children,&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; Katz's replacement, Tom Kalinske, arranged to place Sonic the Hedgehog as the pack-in game with the Genesis.&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93;  Featuring speedy gameplay, Sonic the Hedgehog received critical acclaim,&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93; greatly increased the popularity of the Sega Genesis in North America,&#91;20&#93; and is credited with helping Sega gain 65% of the market share against Nintendo.&#91;8&#93; Naka was dissatisfied with his treatment at Sega and felt he received little credit for his involvement in the success. He quit but was hired by Mark Cerny to work at the US-based Sega Technical Institute (STI), with a higher salary and more creative freedom. Yashura also decided to move to STI.&#91;21&#93;&#91;20&#93; STI began work on Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992) in November 1991.&#91;21&#93; Level artist Yasushi Yamaguchi designed Sonic's new sidekick, Tails, a flying two-tailed fox inspired by the mythological kitsune.&#91;2&#93; Like its predecessor, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a major success, but its development suffered from the language barrier and cultural differences between the Japanese and American developers.&#91;22&#93; While STI developed Sonic 2, Ohshima led a team in Japan to create Sonic CD for the Genesis's CD-ROM accessory, the Sega CD;&#91;23&#93; it was conceived as an enhanced port of Sonic 2, but eventually evolved into a separate project.&#91;24&#93;
Once development on Sonic 2 concluded, Cerny departed and was replaced by Roger Hector. Under Hector, STI was divided into two teams: the Japanese developers led by Naka, and the American developers.&#91;22&#93; The Japanese began work on Sonic the Hedgehog 3.&#91;25&#93; Sonic 3 was initially developed as an isometric game using the Sega Virtua Processor (SVP) chip, but was restarted as a more conventional 2D game after the SVP was delayed.&#91;4&#93; The game introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles, created by artist Takashi Thomas Yuda.&#91;5&#93;:51; 233 Due to an impending promotion with McDonald's and cartridges size constraints, the project was split in two: the first half, Sonic 3, released in February 1994, while the second, Sonic &amp; Knuckles, launched a few months later.&#91;26&#93; The Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge contains an adapter that allows players to connect it to Sonic 3 so the game can be experienced as intended.&#91;27&#93; Sonic 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles, as with their predecessors, were acclaimed.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93; When Sega management realized Sonic the Hedgehog 3 would not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday shopping season, it commissioned the American team to make a new game, the spin-off Sonic Spinball.&#91;31&#93; While Spinball was poorly received, it sold well and helped build the reputation of its developers.&#91;21&#93;
A number of Sonic games were developed for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and the handheld Game Gear. The first, an 8-bit version of the original Sonic, was developed by Ancient to promote the Game Gear and released in December 1991.&#91;32&#93; Aspect Co. developed most of the subsequent 8-bit Sonic games, beginning with a version of Sonic 2.&#91;33&#93; Other Sonic games released during this period include Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (a Western localization of the Japanese puzzle game Puyo Puyo),&#91;34&#93; SegaSonic the Hedgehog (an arcade game),&#91;35&#93; and Knuckles' Chaotix (a spin-off for the Genesis's 32X add-on starring Knuckles).&#91;36&#93;
Following the release of Sonic &amp; Knuckles in 1994, Yasuhara quit Sega and Naka returned to Japan, having been offered a role as a producer.&#91;13&#93; He was reunited with Ohshima and brought with him Takashi Iizuka,&#91;37&#93; who had worked with Naka's team at STI.&#91;25&#93; With Naka's return, Sonic Team was officially formed as a brand.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93; In 1996, towards the end of the Genesis' lifecycle, Sega released Sonic 3D Blast, an isometric game based on the original Sonic 3 concept,&#91;40&#93; as the system still had a large install base.&#91;41&#93; In Japan, Sonic Team was developing a new intellectual property,&#91;13&#93; Nights into Dreams (1996), for Sega's 32-bit Saturn console, so 3D Blast was outsourced to the British studio Traveller's Tales.&#91;42&#93; While 3D Blast sold well,&#91;41&#93;&#91;43&#93; it was criticized for its gameplay, controls, and slow pace.&#91;44&#93;&#91;45&#93;&#91;46&#93;
Meanwhile, in America, STI worked on Sonic X-treme, a 3D Sonic game for the Saturn intended for the 1996 holiday shopping season. Development was hindered by disputes between Sega of America and Japan, Naka's refusal to let STI use the Nights into Dreams game engine, and problems adapting the series to 3D. After two lead developers became ill, X-treme was canceled.&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93; Journalists and fans have speculated about the impact X-treme might have had if it was released,&#91;47&#93;&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93; with producer Mike Wallis believing it "definitely would have been competitive" with the first 3D Mario game, Super Mario 64 (1996).&#91;48&#93; Due to X-treme&#39;s cancellation, Sega ported 3D Blast to the Saturn&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93; with updated graphics and bonus levels developed by Sonic Team.&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93;
In 1997, Sega announced "Project Sonic", a promotional campaign aimed at increasing market awareness of and renewing excitement for the Sonic brand. The first Project Sonic release, the compilation Sonic Jam,&#91;55&#93; included a 3D overworld used by Sonic Team to experiment with 3D Sonic gameplay.&#91;56&#93; Sonic Team and Traveller's Tales collaborated again on the second Project Sonic game, Sonic R,&#91;57&#93; a 3D racing game and the only original Sonic game for the Saturn.&#91;58&#93;&#91;59&#93; Sonic Jam was well received,&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93; while Sonic R&#39;s reviews were more divided.&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93; The cancellation of Sonic X-treme, as well as the Saturn's general lack of Sonic games, are considered important factors in the Saturn's commercial failure.&#91;58&#93;&#91;64&#93; According to Nick Thorpe of Retro Gamer, "by mid-1997 Sonic had essentially been shuffled into the background... it was astonishing to see that just six years after his debut, Sonic was already retro."&#91;65&#93;
With its Sonic Jam experiments, Sonic Team began developing a 3D Sonic platformer for the Saturn. The project stemmed from a proposal by Iizuka to develop a Sonic role-playing video game (RPG) with an emphasis on storytelling. Development moved to Sega's new console, the Dreamcast, which Naka believed would allow for the ultimate Sonic game.&#91;5&#93;:65–67 Sonic Adventure, directed by Iizuka and released in 1998,&#91;66&#93; was one of the first sixth generation video games.&#91;67&#93; It introduced elements that became series staples,&#91;68&#93;&#91;69&#93; such as artist Yuji Uekawa's new character designs influenced by comics and animation.&#91;68&#93; In 1999, Iizuka and 11 other Sonic Team members relocated to San Francisco and established Sonic Team USA.&#91;13&#93; Sonic Team USA developed the sequel Sonic Adventure 2 (2001), designed to be more action-oriented.&#91;70&#93; Between the two releases, Ohshima left Sega to form Artoon.&#91;71&#93; While both Adventure games were well received&#91;66&#93; and the first sold over two million copies,&#91;72&#93; consumer interest in the Dreamcast quickly faded, and Sega's attempts to spur sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses.&#91;73&#93;
In January 2001, Sega announced it was discontinuing the Dreamcast to become a third-party developer.&#91;74&#93; The following December,&#91;75&#93; Sega released an expanded port of Sonic Adventure 2 for Nintendo's GameCube.&#91;76&#93; Afterward, Sonic Team USA developed the first multi-platform Sonic game, Sonic Heroes (2003), for the GameCube, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation 2.&#91;77&#93; The game, again directed by Iizuka, was designed for a broad audience,&#91;78&#93; and Sonic Team revived elements not seen since the Genesis era, such as special stages and the Chaotix characters.&#91;79&#93; Reviews for Sonic Heroes were mixed;&#91;80&#93; while its graphics and gameplay were praised, critics felt it failed to address the problems of previous Sonic games, such as the camera.&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93;  After completing Sonic Heroes, Sonic Team USA was renamed Sega Studios USA.&#91;13&#93; Its next project was Shadow the Hedgehog (2005), a spin-off starring the popular Adventure 2 character Shadow.&#91;84&#93;&#91;85&#93; While Shadow retains most elements from previous Sonic games, it was aimed at a mature audience and introduced third-person shooting and nonlinear gameplay.&#91;86&#93; Shadow the Hedgehog was panned for its mature themes and level design,&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93; but was a commercial success, selling at least 1.59 ;million units.&#91;89&#93;&#91;90&#93;
Sega continued to release 2D Sonic games. In 1999, it collaborated with SNK to produce Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure,&#91;91&#93; an adaptation of Sonic 2 for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.&#91;92&#93; Some SNK staff went on to form Dimps the following year and developed original 2D Sonic games—Sonic Advance (2001), Sonic Advance 2 (2002), and Sonic Advance 3 (2004)—for Nintendo's Game Boy Advance (GBA).&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93; Sonic Advance was outsourced to Dimps because Sonic Team was understaffed with employees familiar with the GBA.&#91;95&#93; Dimps also developed Sonic Rush (2005) for the Nintendo DS, which uses a 2.5D perspective.&#91;96&#93;&#91;97&#93; Dimps' projects all received generally favorable reviews.&#91;98&#93; To introduce older games in the series to new fans, Sonic Team developed two compilations, Sonic Mega Collection (2002) and Sonic Gems Collection (2005).&#91;99&#93; Further spin-offs included the party game Sonic Shuffle (2000),&#91;100&#93; the pinball game Sonic Pinball Party (2003),&#91;101&#93; and the fighting game Sonic Battle (2003).&#91;102&#93;
For the franchise's 15th anniversary in 2006, Sonic Team developed Sonic Riders,&#91;103&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog,&#91;104&#93; and a GBA port of the original Sonic.&#91;105&#93; Sonic Riders, the first Sonic racing game since Sonic R, was designed to appeal to Sonic and extreme sports fans.&#91;106&#93;&#91;107&#93; With a more realistic setting than previous entries, Sonic the Hedgehog was intended to reboot the series for seventh generation consoles such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93; The development faced serious problems; Naka, the last of the original Sonic development team, resigned as head of Sonic Team to form Prope,&#91;111&#93; and the team split so work could begin on a Nintendo Wii Sonic game. According to Iizuka, these incidents, coupled with stringent Sega deadlines and an unpolished game engine, forced Sonic Team to rush development.&#91;108&#93; None of the 15th-anniversary Sonic games were successful critically,&#91;112&#93;&#91;113&#93; but Sonic the Hedgehog became regarded as the worst game in the series, panned for its bugs, camera, controls, and story.&#91;114&#93;&#91;115&#93; Brian Shea of Game Informer wrote that it "[became] synonymous with the struggles the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise had faced in recent years. Sonic 2006 was meant to be a return to the series' roots, but it ended up damning the franchise in the eyes of many."&#91;108&#93;
The first Sonic game for the Wii, Sonic and the Secret Rings (2007), takes place in the world of Arabian Nights and was released instead of a port of the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog.&#91;116&#93; Citing lengthy development times, Sega switched plans and conceived a game that would use the motion detection of the Wii Remote.&#91;117&#93; Sega released a sequel, Sonic and the Black Knight, set in the world of King Arthur, in 2009.&#91;118&#93; Secret Rings and Black Night form what is known as the Sonic Storybook sub-series.&#91;119&#93; A Sonic Riders sequel, Zero Gravity (2008), was developed for the Wii and PlayStation 2.&#91;120&#93; Dimps returned to the Sonic series with Sonic Rush Adventure, a sequel to Sonic Rush, in 2007,&#91;121&#93; while BioWare developed the first Sonic RPG, Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood (2008), also for the DS.&#91;122&#93; Backbone Entertainment developed two Sonic games exclusive to the PlayStation Portable, Sonic Rivals (2006) and Sonic Rivals 2 (2007).&#91;123&#93;&#91;124&#93;
Sonic Team began working on Sonic Unleashed (2008) in 2005.&#91;125&#93; It was conceived as a sequel to Adventure 2, but became a standalone entry after Sonic Team introduced innovations to separate it from the Adventure games.&#91;126&#93; With Unleashed, Sonic Team sought to combine the best aspects of 2D and 3D Sonic games and address criticisms of previous 3D entries,&#91;127&#93;&#91;128&#93; although reviews were mixed.&#91;129&#93; Iizuka was installed as the head of Sonic Team in 2010,&#91;130&#93;&#91;131&#93; and became the series' producer. Iizuka felt Sonic was struggling because it lacked unified direction,&#91;66&#93; so Sonic Team refocused on speed and more traditional side-scrolling.&#91;132&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog 4, a side-scrolling episodic sequel to Sonic &amp; Knuckles co-developed by Sonic Team and Dimps,&#91;133&#93; began with Episode I in 2010,&#91;134&#93; followed by Episode II in 2012.&#91;135&#93; Later in 2010, Sega released Sonic Colors for the Wii and DS, which expanded on the well received aspects of Unleashed and introduced the Wisp power-ups.&#91;136&#93; For the series' 20th anniversary in 2011, Sega released Sonic Generations for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Windows;&#91;137&#93;&#91;138&#93; a separate version was developed by Dimps for the Nintendo 3DS.&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93; Sonic Generations featured remakes of levels from previous Sonic games and reintroduced the "classic" Sonic design from the Genesis era.&#91;137&#93;&#91;140&#93; These efforts were better received, especially in comparison to the 2006 game and Unleashed.&#91;132&#93;
In May 2013, Nintendo announced it was collaborating with Sega to produce Sonic games for its Wii U and 3DS platforms.&#91;141&#93; The first game in the partnership, 2013's Sonic Lost World,&#91;141&#93; was also the first Sonic game for eighth generation hardware.&#91;142&#93; Sonic Lost World was designed to be streamlined and fluid in movement and design,&#91;143&#93; borrowing elements from Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy games and the canceled X-treme.&#91;144&#93; The second was Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games (2013) for the Wii U, the fourth Mario &amp; Sonic game and a 2014 Winter Olympics tie-in (see Crossovers section).&#91;141&#93; The deal was completed in 2014 with the release of Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric for the Wii U and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal for the 3DS; these games were based on the Sonic Boom television series (see Animation section).&#91;132&#93;&#91;145&#93; None of the games were well received; Sonic Lost World polarized critics,&#91;146&#93; while critics found Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games mediocre&#91;147&#93; and panned the Sonic Boom games.&#91;132&#93; Nonetheless, Sonic Boom: Fire &amp; Ice, a Shattered Crystal sequel, was released in 2016.&#91;148&#93;
Sega began to release more Sonic games for mobile phones,&#91;132&#93; such as iOS and Android devices. After he developed a version of Sonic CD for modern consoles in 2011, Australian programmer Christian "Taxman" Whitehead collaborated with fellow Sonic fandom member Simon "Stealth" Thomley to develop remasters of the original Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for iOS and Android, which were released in 2013.&#91;149&#93; The remasters were developed using Whitehead's Retro Engine, an engine tailored for 2D projects,&#91;149&#93; and received praise.&#91;150&#93;&#91;151&#93; Sonic Dash (2013), a Temple Run-style endless runner,&#91;152&#93; was developed by Hardlight&#91;153&#93; and downloaded over 350 ;million times by 2020,&#91;154&#93; and received a Sonic Boom-themed sequel in 2015.&#91;155&#93; Sonic Team released Sonic Runners, its first game for mobile devices, in 2015.&#91;156&#93; Sonic Runners was also an endless runner,&#91;156&#93; but was unsuccessful&#91;157&#93; and discontinued a year after release.&#91;158&#93; Gameloft released a sequel, Sonic Runners Adventure, in 2017 to generally positive reviews.&#91;159&#93;&#91;160&#93;
In a 2015 interview with Polygon, Iizuka acknowledged that contemporary Sonic games had been disappointing. He hoped, from then on, that the Sonic Team logo would stand as a "mark of quality"; he planned to release quality games and expand the Sonic brand, while retaining the modern Sonic design.&#91;132&#93; At the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016, Sega announced two Sonic games to coincide with the series' 25th anniversary: Sonic Mania and Sonic Forces.&#91;161&#93; Both were released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows in 2017.&#91;162&#93;&#91;163&#93; Sonic Mania was developed by the independent game developers PagodaWest Games and Headcannon with a staff comprising members of the Sonic fandom; Whitehead conceived the project and served as director.&#91;164&#93; The game, which emulates the gameplay and visuals of the Genesis entries, was hailed as a return to form for the franchise.&#91;165&#93;&#91;166&#93;&#91;167&#93; Meanwhile, Sonic Team developed Sonic Forces, which revives the dual gameplay of Sonic Generations along with a third gameplay style featuring the player's custom character.&#91;168&#93;&#91;169&#93; Sonic Forces received mixed reviews,&#91;170&#93; with criticism for its short length.&#91;168&#93;&#91;171&#93;&#91;172&#93; At SXSW 2019, Iizuka confirmed a new mainline Sonic game was in development.&#91;173&#93; Additionally, Sumo Digital developed a Sonic kart racing game, Team Sonic Racing (2019).&#91;174&#93;&#91;175&#93;&#91;176&#93;
Sega wanted Sonic to have strong Western appeal, so Sonic Team created a backstory similar to those of characters created by Disney, Marvel, Hanna-Barbera, and Sanrio.&#91;177&#93; Ohshima developed a backstory with heavy American influence. In Ohshima's story, in the 1940s, there was a pilot whose peers nicknamed him "Hedgehog", and his jacket's embroidery contained an emblem with a hedgehog. The pilot married a children's book author, who wrote a story about a hedgehog based on the pilot. According to Ohshima, that story was the basis of the original Sonic the Hedgehog, and the title screen is based on the pilot's emblem.&#91;177&#93; The team came up with two ideas—Sonic being part of a rock band and having a human girlfriend named Madonna—that did not make it into the game. The rock band was scrapped due to time and cartridge constraints,&#91;178&#93; while Sega felt Madonna was inappropriate given the young target audience.&#91;179&#93;
When localizing the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega of America was given little background information regarding the game's lore by the Japanese developers,&#91;180&#93; and distributed an internal document that contained its "localized history and overall philosophy" for Sonic.&#91;181&#93; Known colloquially as the "Sonic the Hedgehog Bible",&#91;181&#93; the 13-page&#91;182&#93; document went through multiple drafts.&#91;180&#93; One established that Sonic was from a family of hedgehogs that lived under a hedge in Hardly, Nebraska, and joined the town's track team after a coach noticed his speed.&#91;181&#93; Later drafts abandoned this story,&#91;180&#93; instead stating that Sonic learned his abilities from forest animals.&#91;181&#93; However, all three drafts establish that Eggman was benevolent and crafted Sonic's red sneakers before he became evil in a freak accident involving a rotten egg.&#91;181&#93; The Sonic Bible had little lasting influence on the franchise,&#91;182&#93; although it heavily informed the writers of Sonic the Comic. The Japanese developers eventually integrated their backstory concepts in the games, rendering the Sonic Bible non-canon.&#91;180&#93;
Sonic games traditionally follow Sonic's efforts to stop the mad scientist Eggman, who schemes to obtain the Chaos Emeralds—seven&#91;b&#93; emeralds with mystical powers. Within the Sonic lore, the Emeralds can turn thoughts into power,&#91;184&#93; warp time and space with a technique called Chaos Control,&#91;185&#93;&#91;186&#93; give energy to all living things, and be used to create nuclear or laser-based weaponry.&#91;187&#93; They typically act as MacGuffins in the games' stories.&#91;188&#93; Sonic &amp; Knuckles introduced the Master Emerald,&#91;189&#93; which controls the power of the Chaos Emeralds.&#91;184&#93; Eggman seeks the Emeralds in his quest to conquer the world, and traps animals in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. Because Sonic Team was inspired by the culture of the 1990s, Sonic features strong environmental themes.&#91;177&#93; Sonic represents "nature",&#91;177&#93; while Eggman represents "machinery" and "development"—a play on the then-growing debate between environmentalists and developers.&#91;190&#93;
The Sonic franchise is known for its large cast of characters;&#91;191&#93; Sonic the Fighters (1996) producer Yu Suzuki joked that anyone who makes a Sonic game has the duty to create new characters.&#91;192&#93; The first game introduced Sonic, a blue hedgehog who can run at incredible speeds, and Eggman, a rotund mad scientist who designs robots and seeks the Chaos Emeralds.&#91;3&#93; During the Genesis era, Eggman was referred to as Doctor Ivo Robotnik in Western territories.&#91;193&#93;&#91;194&#93; The name change, instituted by Sega of America's Dean Sitton,&#91;181&#93; was made without consulting the Japanese developers, who did not want a single character to have two different names. Since Sonic Adventure, the character has been referred to as Eggman in all territories,&#91;193&#93; although the Robotnik name is still acknowledged.&#91;194&#93;&#91;195&#93;&#91;196&#93;
Much of the series' core cast was introduced in the succeeding games for the Genesis and its add-ons. Sonic 2 introduced Sonic's sidekick Miles "Tails" Prower, a yellow fox who can fly using his two tails.&#91;197&#93; Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose, a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend, and Metal Sonic, a robotic doppelgänger of Sonic created by Eggman.&#91;198&#93; Sonic 3 introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles, a red echidna and the guardian of the Master Emerald,&#91;199&#93; while Knuckles' Chaotix introduced the Chaotix, a group comprising Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee.&#91;200&#93; A number of characters introduced during this period, such as Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel from SegaSonic the Hedgehog and Fang the Sniper from Sonic Triple Trouble (1994), faded into obscurity, although they sometimes reappear.&#91;35&#93;&#91;201&#93;
During Sonic Adventure&#39;s development, Sonic Team discovered that the characters' designs from the Genesis games, which were relatively simple, did not suit a 3D environment. As such, the art style was modernized to alter the characters' proportions and make them appeal to Western audiences.&#91;68&#93; Since Sonic Adventure, the series' cast has expanded considerably.&#91;191&#93; Notable characters include Big,&#91;202&#93; a large cat who fishes for his pet frog;&#91;203&#93;&#91;204&#93; the E-100 Series of robots;&#91;205&#93; Shadow, a brooding black hedgehog;&#91;202&#93; Rouge, a treasure-hunting bat;&#91;206&#93; Blaze, a cat from an alternate dimension;&#91;207&#93; and Silver, a telekinetic hedgehog from the future.&#91;202&#93; The series also features two fictional species: Chao, which function as digital pets and minor gameplay elements,&#91;208&#93; and Wisps, which function as power-ups.&#91;209&#93;
Some Sonic characters have headlined spin-off games. Eggman is the featured character of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, a Western localization of Puyo Puyo. Sega chose to replace the Puyo Puyo characters with those from the Sonic franchise because it feared the product would not be popular with a Western audience.&#91;210&#93; In 1995, Sega released two Game Gear spin-offs featuring Tails—Tails' Skypatrol (a scrolling shooter) and Tails Adventure (a Metroidvania game)&#91;211&#93;&#91;212&#93;—and the Knuckles-oriented Knuckles' Chaotix for the 32X.&#91;36&#93; 2005's Shadow the Hedgehog was developed in response to the Shadow character's popularity and to introduce "gun action" gameplay to the franchise.&#91;178&#93; Iizuka has commented that future spin-offs, such as sequels to Knuckles' Chaotix and Shadow the Hedgehog or a Big the Cat game, remain possibilities.&#91;213&#93;&#91;214&#93;
The Sonic series is characterized by speed-based platforming gameplay.&#91;191&#93; Controlling the player character, the player navigates a series of levels at high speeds while jumping between platforms and avoiding obstacles.&#91;215&#93; The series contains both 2D and 3D games.&#91;216&#93; 2D entries generally feature simple, pinball-like gameplay&#91;215&#93;&#91;217&#93;—with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button&#91;218&#93;—and branching level paths that require memorization to maintain speed.&#91;215&#93;&#91;217&#93; Meanwhile, 3D entries tend to be more linear in design,&#91;217&#93; feature various level objectives,&#91;219&#93; different movesets,&#91;217&#93; and allow players to upgrade and customize the playable character.&#91;219&#93;&#91;220&#93; Games since Sonic Unleashed have blended 2D and 3D gameplay, with the camera shifting between side-scrolling and third-person perspectives.&#91;136&#93;&#91;221&#93;
One distinctive game mechanic of Sonic games are collectible golden rings spread throughout levels,&#91;222&#93; which act as a form of health.&#91;223&#93; Players possessing rings can survive upon sustaining damage, but the rings are scattered and the player has a short amount of time to re-collect some of them before they disappear.&#91;222&#93;&#91;224&#93; Collecting 100 rings usually rewards the player an extra life.&#91;219&#93;&#91;224&#93; Rings have other uses in certain games, such as currency in the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog,&#91;220&#93; restoring health bars in Sonic Unleashed,&#91;225&#93; or improving statistics in Sonic Riders.&#91;226&#93; Levels in Sonic games feature elements such as slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops.&#91;3&#93;&#91;227&#93; Springs, springboards, and dash panels are scattered throughout and catapult the player at high speeds in a particular direction.&#91;228&#93; Players' progress in levels is saved through passing checkpoints.&#91;229&#93; Checkpoints serve other uses in various games, such as entering bonus stages.&#91;224&#93; Some level locales, most notably Green Hill Zone, recur throughout the series.&#91;230&#93; Levels typically end with a boss encounter.&#91;231&#93;
The series contains numerous power-ups, which are held in boxes that appear throughout levels.&#91;232&#93; An icon indicates what it contains, and the player releases the item by destroying the box.&#91;233&#93; Common items in boxes include rings, a shield, invincibility, high speed, and extra lives.&#91;72&#93;&#91;233&#93; Sonic Colors introduced the Wisps, a race of extraterrestrial creatures that act as power-ups. Each Wisp has its own special ability corresponding to its color; for instance, yellow Wisps allow players to drill underground and find otherwise inaccessible areas.&#91;234&#93;
In most Sonic games, the goal is to collect the Chaos Emeralds;&#91;183&#93;&#91;235&#93; the player is required to collect them all to defeat Eggman and achieve the games' good endings.&#91;183&#93;&#91;236&#93; Sonic games that do not feature the Chaos Emeralds, such as Sonic CD, feature different collectibles that otherwise function the same.&#91;237&#93; Some games require the player to find the Emeralds by entering portals,&#91;236&#93; opening portals using 50 rings,&#91;238&#93; or scouting them within levels themselves.&#91;239&#93; In some games, the Emeralds are collected automatically as the story progresses.&#91;240&#93;&#91;241&#93; By collecting the Emeralds, players are rewarded with their characters' "Super" form and can activate it by collecting 50 rings in a stage. The Super transformations grant the player character more speed, a farther jump, and invincibility, but their ring count drains by the second; the transformation lasts until all the rings have been used.&#91;242&#93;&#91;243&#93; Some games require the player to collect all the Chaos Emeralds to reach the final boss.&#91;244&#93;
Sonic games often share basic gameplay, but some have game mechanics that distinguish them from others. For instance, Knuckles' Chaotix is similar to previous entries in the series, but introduces a partner system whereby the player is connected to another character via a tether; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be used to maneuver the characters.&#91;200&#93; Sonic Unleashed introduces the Werehog, a beat 'em up gameplay style in which Sonic transforms into a werewolf-like beast and must fight enemies using brute strength.&#91;245&#93; Both the Sonic Storybook games feature unique concepts: Secret Rings is controlled exclusively using the Wii Remote's motion detection,&#91;246&#93; which Black Night incorporates hack and slash gameplay.&#91;247&#93; While some games feature Sonic as the only playable character,&#91;246&#93;&#91;248&#93; others feature multiple, who have alternate movesets and storylines.&#91;132&#93;&#91;249&#93; For instance, in Sonic &amp; Knuckles, Knuckles goes through the same levels as Sonic, but his story is different, he explores different parts of the levels, and certain areas are more difficult.&#91;250&#93;
Many Sonic games contain multiplayer and cooperative gameplay, beginning with Sonic the Hedgehog 2.&#91;200&#93;&#91;251&#93; In some games, if the player chooses to control Sonic and Tails together, a second player can join in at any time and control Tails separately.&#91;252&#93; Sonic games also feature a competitive mode where two players compete against each other to the finish line in a split screen race.&#91;253&#93;
Sonic's first appearance, five months before the release of Sonic the Hedgehog, was in Sega AM3's racing game Rad Mobile (1991) as an ornament hanging from the driver's rearview mirror. The Sonic developers let AM3 use Sonic because they were interested in getting the character visible to the public.&#91;254&#93; Sonic appears in other Sonic Team games as a playable character in Christmas Nights (1996),&#91;255&#93; a power-up in Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg (2003),&#91;256&#93; and in a cameo in the 2008 Wii version of Samba de Amigo (1999).&#91;257&#93; Sonic characters also feature in the Sega All-Stars series, which includes Sega Superstars (2004),&#91;258&#93; Sega Superstars Tennis (2008),&#91;259&#93; and Sumo Digital's kart racing games Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing (2010) and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012).&#91;174&#93;&#91;175&#93; Flicky, the blue bird from Sega's 1984 arcade game, appears in several Sonic games.&#91;260&#93;
Since 2007, Sega has collaborated with former rival Nintendo to produce Mario &amp; Sonic, an Olympic Games-themed crossover with the Mario franchise. The first Mario &amp; Sonic game was released in 2007 for the Wii and in 2008 for the DS to tie in with the 2008 Summer Olympics.&#91;261&#93;&#91;262&#93;&#91;263&#93; Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, based on the 2010 Winter Olympics, was released in 2010 for the Wii and DS,&#91;264&#93; and Mario &amp; Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, based on the 2012 Summer Olympics, was released for the Wii in 2011 and the 3DS in 2012.&#91;265&#93; The fourth game, 2013's Mario &amp; Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, was exclusive to the Wii U,&#91;266&#93; but the following game, Mario &amp; Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games (2016), was released on both the Wii U and 3DS.&#91;267&#93; After a brief hiatus, the series made a return in 2019 with Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 for the Switch, based on the 2020 Summer Olympics.&#91;268&#93;
Sonic appears as a playable character in Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. crossover fighting games, beginning with Super Smash Bros. Brawl in 2008. Alongside Solid Snake from Konami's Metal Gear franchise, Sonic was the first non-Nintendo character to appear in Smash.&#91;269&#93; He was considered for inclusion in Super Smash Bros. Melee (2001), but the game was too close to completion so his introduction was delayed until Brawl.&#91;270&#93; He returned in the sequels Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U (2014) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (2018).&#91;271&#93;&#91;272&#93; Shadow and Knuckles appear in Smash as non-playable characters,&#91;273&#93; while Tails and Knuckles costumes are available for players' Mii avatars.&#91;274&#93; A Sonic amiibo figurine was released for the Smash games, and is also compatible with Mario Kart 8 (2014), Super Mario Maker (2015), and Yoshi's Woolly World (2015).&#91;275&#93;&#91;276&#93;&#91;277&#93;
In June 2015, characters from the Angry Birds RPG Angry Birds Epic (2014) appeared as playable characters in Sonic Dash during a three-week promotion,&#91;278&#93; while Sonic was added to Angry Birds Epic as a playable character the following September.&#91;279&#93; Similar crossovers with the Sanrio characters Hello Kitty, Badtz-Maru, My Melody, and Chococat and the Namco game Pac-Man took place in December 2016 and February 2018.&#91;280&#93;&#91;281&#93; In November 2016, a Sonic expansion pack was released for the toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions (2015); the pack includes Sonic as a playable character, in addition to Sonic levels and vehicles.&#91;282&#93;
Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry at the time the original Sonic was in development, and suggested his friend Yūzō Kayama write the score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and instead commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True.&#91;283&#93;&#91;4&#93; Nakamura returned to compose Sonic 2&#39;s soundtrack. For both games, Nakamura began composing early in development with only concept images for reference.&#91;284&#93; He treated Sonic as a film and designed the music around the atmosphere that he felt from the images of the stages.&#91;285&#93; After the original game was released, Nakamura became popular in Japan, and increased his asking price. Dreams Come True owns the rights to Nakamura's score, which created problems when the Sonic Spinball team used his Sonic theme music without permission.&#91;21&#93;
Two soundtracks were composed for Sonic CD: the original score, featured in the Japanese and European releases, was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata, while the North American version was scored by Spencer Nilsen, David Young, and Mark Crew. The Japanese composers drew inspiration from club music such as house and techno, while Hataya cited C+C Music Factory, Frankie Knuckles, and the KLF as influences.&#91;286&#93; According to Nilsen, Sega commissioned a new soundtrack for the American release as the marketing department felt it needed a "more musically rich and complex" soundtrack.&#91;287&#93;
A number of composers contributed to the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 score, including Sega sound staff&#91;288&#93; and independent contractors recruited to finish the game on schedule.&#91;289&#93; American pop musician Michael Jackson, a Sonic fan, approached Sega, and he was hired to write tracks for Sonic 3. However, it is unclear if Jackson's contributions remain in the final game. According to Ohshima and Hector, Jackson's involvement was terminated and his music reworked following the first allegations of sexual abuse against him,&#91;290&#93;&#91;35&#93; but composers Doug Grigsby, Cirocco Jones, and Brad Buxer said his contributions remained.&#91;291&#93; Buxer, who was Jackson's musical director, recalled Jackson chose to go uncredited because he was unhappy with how his music sounded on the Genesis,&#91;291&#93; and that the credits music became the basis for Jackson's 1996 single "Stranger in Moscow".&#91;292&#93;
Sonic 3 was the first Sonic game composer Jun Senoue worked on.&#91;288&#93; With his band Crush 40, he has composed the music for most Sonic games since Sonic 3D Blast.&#91;c&#93; While the Genesis Sonic soundtracks were characterized by electropop, Senoue's scores typically feature funk and rock music.&#91;303&#93; Tomoya Ohtani has been the series' sound director since Sonic the Hedgehog in 2006, and was the lead composer for that game, Sonic Unleashed, Sonic Colors, Sonic Lost World, Sonic Runners, and Sonic Forces.&#91;304&#93;&#91;305&#93; Richard Jacques has composed music for several Sonic games,&#91;306&#93;&#91;307&#93; and Tee Lopes—known for releasing unofficial remixes of Sonic tracks on YouTube—was the lead composer for Sonic Mania&#91;308&#93; and a contributor to Team Sonic Racing.&#91;309&#93; Recent games have featured contributions from notable musicians; for instance, the main theme of the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog was performed by Ali Tabatabaee and Matty Lewis of the band Zebrahead,&#91;310&#93; while Hoobastank lead singer Doug Robb performed the main theme of Sonic Forces.&#91;311&#93;
Sega approached the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1992 about producing two television series—"a syndicated show for the after-school audience" and a Saturday-morning cartoon—based on Sonic. Kalinske "had seen how instrumental the launch of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon series was to the success of the toyline" during his time at Mattel and believed that success could be recreated using Sonic.&#91;312&#93; The two cartoons, the syndicated Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (1993) and ABC's Sonic the Hedgehog (1993–1994), were produced by DIC Entertainment. DIC also produced a Sonic Christmas special in 1996, and Sonic Underground in 1999, to promote Sonic Adventure.&#91;313&#93;&#91;314&#93; DIC's Sonic adaptations are generally not held in high regard.&#91;313&#93;&#91;315&#93;&#91;316&#93;
Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog comprises 65 episodes overseen by Ren &amp; Stimpy director Kent Butterworth and features slapstick humor in the vein of Looney Tunes.&#91;317&#93; Meanwhile, the 26-episode Sonic the Hedgehog (commonly called Sonic SatAM)&#91;314&#93; features a bleak setting in which Eggman had conquered the world, while Sonic is a member of a resistance force that opposes him.&#91;317&#93; The series was canceled after two seasons.&#91;314&#93; Sonic Underground was supposed to last for 65 episodes, but only 40 were produced. The series follows Sonic and his siblings Manic and Sonia, who use the power of music to fight against Eggman and reunite with their mother.&#91;313&#93;&#91;314&#93; In all three series, Sonic is voiced by Family Matters star Jaleel White.&#91;313&#93;
In Japan, Sega and Sonic Team collaborated with Studio Pierrot to produce a Sonic original video animation (OVA). The two-episode OVA, Sonic the Hedgehog, was released direct-to-video in Japan in 1996. To coincide with Sonic Adventure&#39;s Western release in 1999,&#91;318&#93; ADV Films released the OVA in North America as a 55-minute film dubbed Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Sonic the Hedgehog, produced with input from Naka and Ohshima, is loosely based on Sonic CD (with certain elements borrowed from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3),&#91;313&#93; and recounts Sonic's efforts to stop a generator taken over by Eggman from exploding and destroying their world.&#91;319&#93; Retrospectively, The A.V. Club&#39;s Patrick Lee called the OVA "the only cartoon to adapt the look, sound, and feel of the Sonic games", with scenes and music that closely resemble the source material.&#91;313&#93;
Sonic X, an anime series produced by TMS Entertainment and overseen by Naka, ran for three seasons (78 episodes) from 2003 to 2006.&#91;313&#93;&#91;320&#93; While previous series' episodes simply had self-contained plots, Sonic X told a single story that spanned the series' run.&#91;313&#93; In it, the Sonic cast teleports from their home planet to Earth during a scuffle with Eggman, where they meet a human boy, Chris Thorndyke. Throughout the course of the series, Sonic and his friends attempt to return to their world while fighting Eggman. The second season adapts the Sonic Adventure games and Sonic Battle, while the third season sees the friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space and fight an army of aliens.&#91;313&#93;&#91;320&#93; Although Sonic X divided critics&#91;321&#93; and suffered from poor ratings in Japan,&#91;320&#93; it consistently topped ratings for its timeslot in the US and France.&#91;322&#93;&#91;323&#93;
Sonic Boom, a computer-animated series produced by Sega and Genao Productions,&#91;324&#93; premiered on Cartoon Network in November 2014.&#91;325&#93; It features a satirical take on the Sonic mythos,&#91;314&#93; and the franchise's cast was redesigned for it.&#91;325&#93; According to Iizuka, Sonic Boom came about as a desire to appeal more to Western audiences, and it ran parallel with the main Sonic franchise.&#91;326&#93; To promote the release of Sonic Mania Plus, a five-part series of animated shorts was released on the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel between March 30 and July 17, 2018. The series depicts Sonic's return to his world following the events of Sonic Forces, teaming up with his friends to prevent Eggman and Metal Sonic from collecting the Chaos Emeralds and Master Emerald.&#91;327&#93; The shorts were written and directed by Tyson Hesse, with animation by Neko Productions and music by Tee Lopes.&#91;328&#93; Similarly, Hesse and Neko Productions produced a two-part animated series to tie in with the release of Team Sonic Racing in 2019.&#91;173&#93; Sonic and Tails also appeared as guest stars in OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes in August 2019.&#91;329&#93;
Shogakukan published a Sonic the Hedgehog manga series in its Shogaku Yonensei magazine, beginning in 1992. Written by Kenji Terada and illustrated by Sango Norimoto, it follows a sweet but cowardly young hedgehog named Nicky whose alter ego is the cocky, heroic Sonic.&#91;330&#93; According to character artist Kazuyuki Hoshino, the manga was part of Sega of Japan's promotional strategy to appeal to primary school children.&#91;331&#93; The Sonic design team worked with Shogakukan to create new characters; Amy Rose and Charmy Bee originated in the manga before appearing in the games.&#91;35&#93;&#91;331&#93;
The longest-running Sonic-based publication is the 290-issue Sonic the Hedgehog, an American comic book published by Archie Comics from 1993 until its cancellation in 2017.&#91;332&#93; Archie also published a number of spin-offs, such as Knuckles the Echidna (1997–2000) and Sonic Universe (2009–2017). Archie's comic drew its premise from the Sonic the Hedgehog television series, with Sonic and a resistance force fighting the dictator Eggman.&#91;332&#93; Originally written as a "straightforward lighthearted action-comedy", Sonic the Hedgehog became more dramatic after Ken Penders began writing it with issue #11.&#91;333&#93; Penders remained the head writer for the following 150 issues and developed an elaborate lore unique to the series. Ian Flynn became head writer in 2006 and remained until the series' cancellation.&#91;333&#93; Following a lawsuit by Penders for ownership of characters he created, in 2013 the series was rebooted,&#91;333&#93;&#91;334&#93; leaving only characters introduced in the games or which predated Penders' run.&#91;333&#93;
In 2008, Guinness World Records recognized Archie's Sonic the Hedgehog as the longest-running comic based on a video game,&#91;335&#93; and by 2016 it was one of the longest-running American comics in the market. While Archie planned to publish at least four issues beyond #290, in January 2017 the series went on an abrupt hiatus,&#91;333&#93; and in July, Sega announced it was ending its business relationship with Archie in favor of a new partnership with IDW Publishing.&#91;332&#93; IDW's Sonic comic began in April 2018. Although the creative teams from the Archie series, such as Flynn, returned, the IDW series is set in a different continuity. Flynn said the IDW series differs from the Archie comic in that it draws from the games for stories, with the first story arc set after the events of Sonic Forces.&#91;336&#93; Fans continued the Archie series unofficially, including finishing unpublished issues, while Penders is using the characters he gained ownership of for a graphic novel, The Lara-Su Chronicles.&#91;334&#93;
Sonic the Comic, a British comic published by Fleetway Publications, lasted for 223 issues from 1993 to 2002; contributors included Richard Elson, Nigel Kitching, Andy Diggle, and Nigel Dobbyn. Sonic the Comic featured Sonic stories aimed at children, in addition to news and review sections. Although it adapted the events of the games, the writers established their own lore. The final story arc was a loose adaptation of Sonic Adventure in 2000, but the series continued until 2002; the last 39 issues were reprints of old stories. Following the series' cancellation, fans started Sonic the Comic Online, an unofficial webcomic that continues the stories.&#91;337&#93;
In August 1994, Sega of America signed a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Trilogy Entertainment to produce a live-action animated film to tie in with Sonic X-treme. In May 1995, screenwriter Richard Jefferies pitched a treatment, Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World, to Sega. The treatment saw Sonic and Eggman escape from Sonic X-treme into the real world and Sonic collaborate with a boy to stop Eggman. No agreement was reached and the film was canceled. Jeffries, with permission from Sega, pitched his treatment to DreamWorks Animation, but it was rejected.&#91;312&#93;
In 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the Sonic film rights,&#91;338&#93; and in June 2014 announced it would produce a Sonic film as a joint venture with Sega's Marza Animation Planet.&#91;339&#93; Neal H. Moritz was attached to produce under his Original Film banner, alongside Takeshi Ito, Mie Onishi, and Toru Nakahara.&#91;339&#93; In February 2016, Sega CEO Hajime Satomi stated the film was scheduled for 2018.&#91;340&#93; Blur Studio's Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler were hired the following October to develop the film; Fowler would make his feature directorial debut, while both would executive produce.&#91;341&#93; In October 2017, Paramount Pictures acquired the rights after Sony put the film into turnaround. However, most of the production team remained unchanged,&#91;342&#93; and principal photography began in September 2018 in Ladysmith, British Columbia.&#91;343&#93;
The film, written by Patrick Casey and Josh Miller,&#91;341&#93;&#91;344&#93; follows Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) as he journeys to San Francisco with a small-town cop (James Marsden) so he can escape Eggman (Jim Carrey) and collect his missing rings. Additional cast members include Tika Sumpter, Adam Pally, and Neal McDonough,&#91;345&#93; while Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her voice role as Tails from the games for a mid-credits scene cameo.&#91;346&#93;&#91;347&#93; Sonic was initially redesigned so he would be more realistic, with fur, new running shoes, two separate eyes, and a more humanlike physique.&#91;348&#93;&#91;349&#93; The production team used Ted, the living teddy bear from the Ted films, as a reference to insert a CG character into a real-world setting.&#91;348&#93; Sonic's redesign was met with backlash;&#91;350&#93;&#91;351&#93;&#91;352&#93; it was criticized for not resembling the game design and described as evoking an uncanny valley-type of repulsive response from viewers.&#91;353&#93; As such, the design was revised to better resemble the original.&#91;354&#93;
Paramount originally scheduled Sonic the Hedgehog for a November 8, 2019 release,&#91;355&#93; but delayed it to February 14, 2020, to accommodate the redesign.&#91;356&#93; The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who felt it exceeded the low expectations typically associated with video game-based films; Carrey's performance in particular was praised.&#91;357&#93; Criticism was directed at a perceived lack of originality or ambition,&#91;358&#93; and while Sonic's second redesign was praised, some felt it set a negative precedent for the film industry by giving fans the power to influence the filmmakers.&#91;359&#93; With an estimated budget of $81–95 ;million,&#91;360&#93;&#91;361&#93; the film has grossed over $306 ;million worldwide,&#91;362&#93;&#91;363&#93; making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2020 so far.&#91;364&#93; In March, it became the highest-grossing film based on a video game in US box office history.&#91;365&#93;
In March 2020, Marsden confirmed that he had signed on for sequels to the Sonic film.&#91;366&#93; The following May, Justin Kroll of Variety reported that a sequel was in development. Much of the crew, including Fowler, Casey, and Josh Miller, are set to return.&#91;367&#93; Fowler has said that since the first film served to provide an origin story for Sonic and Eggman, a sequel would introduce more elements from the video games, such as Super Sonic and the Chaos Emeralds.&#91;368&#93;
Licensed Sonic merchandise includes books, clothing, accessories, board games, soundtracks, and toys such as figures and plushes.&#91;369&#93;&#91;370&#93;&#91;371&#93;&#91;372&#93; Sega and McDonald's collaborated for Sonic-themed Happy Meal promotions in 1994 and 2004 to advertise Sonic 3 and Sonic Heroes, respectively.&#91;26&#93;&#91;373&#93; First4Figures has produced a large number of vinyl and resin Sonic figures since 2008.&#91;374&#93;&#91;375&#93; In January 2012, Sega and RHM Solutions opened an online Sonic store,&#91;369&#93; and PlayStation Gear began selling Sonic items in December 2017.&#91;376&#93;
The Sonic platformers released during the 1990s were widely acclaimed and have been listed among the greatest video games of all time.&#91;377&#93;&#91;378&#93;&#91;379&#93; Sonic was touted as a faster, cooler alternative to Nintendo's contemporary Mario game, Super Mario World (1990).&#91;191&#93; According to Kotaku&#39;s Zolani Stewart, Sonic's rebellious character was representative of the culture of the 1990s, "when the idea of individual rebellion seemed inextricably linked to consumer culture".&#91;380&#93; Writing in The Guardian, Keith Stuart observed that Sonic the Hedgehog&#39;s emphasis on speed departed from accepted precepts of game design, requiring that players "learn through repetition rather than observation" as "the levels aren't designed to be seen or even understood in one playthrough... Sonic is incorrect game design and yet ;... it's a masterpiece."&#91;215&#93; Sonic 2, Sonic CD, Sonic 3, and Sonic &amp; Knuckles were praised for building on the first game's formula;&#91;381&#93;&#91;382&#93;&#91;383&#93;&#91;384&#93; in 1996, Next Generation described the Genesis games as "the zeitgeist of the 16-bit era".&#91;379&#93; In 1995, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, told Edge: "I think Sega succeeded in making a good, strong character. There are lots of games that try to imitate Mario but Sega did especially well with Sonic. Despite his resemblance to Mario, there are some special points that make him different: the energy, for example. Among Mario’s imitations, Sonic is a good one."&#91;385&#93;
After the uneventful Saturn era, the series found renewed popularity during the sixth generation of video game consoles. Sonic Adventure, though criticized for its glitches and camera system, was acclaimed for its visuals, spectacle, and varied gameplay;&#91;386&#93;&#91;387&#93;&#91;388&#93; Sonic Adventure 2 was met with similar praise.&#91;296&#93;&#91;389&#93;&#91;390&#93; However, journalists began to feel the series was straying from its roots, with some commenting that Sonic Adventure failed to reinvent Sonic for the 3D era as Super Mario 64 had for Mario.&#91;380&#93;&#91;391&#93;&#91;217&#93; Stewart argued that Sonic Adventure&#39;s addition of voice acting and greater focus on plot changed Sonic into "a flat, lifeless husk of a character, who spits out slogans and generally has only one personality mode, the radical attitude dude, the sad recycled image of vague '90s cultural concept".&#91;380&#93; Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of Eurogamer agreed, writing that Mario's "plucky earnestness and whimsy will always enjoy a longer shelf-life than [Sonic's] over-compensatory edginess".&#91;217&#93;
After the Dreamcast, the series' critical standing began to decline. Evans-Thirlwell summarized further 3D Sonic games as "20-odd years of slowly accumulating bullshit".&#91;217&#93; Although reviews for Sonic Heroes were mostly favorable,&#91;132&#93; Stewart said this was when the focus on story and cutscenes became unbearable.&#91;380&#93; The decline continued with Shadow the Hedgehog—widely criticized as a misguided attempt to bring a sense of maturity to the franchise&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93;&#91;392&#93;—and reached its climax with the critically panned 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog reboot.&#91;108&#93; Sonic Mania developer Christian Whitehead said that the changes to the Sonic formula "stemmed from a — perhaps misplaced — desire to continue to push Sonic as a AAA brand".&#91;132&#93; Journalists, Whitehead, and former Sega of America marketing director Al Nilsen criticized the number of characters added to the series,&#91;132&#93;&#91;191&#93; although Naka had previously justified the additions as necessary to please fans.&#91;393&#93; Evans-Thirlwell argued that Sonic Team had never successfully translated the momentum-based gameplay of the Genesis games to 3D, and that unlike Mario, Sonic never had a 3D "transcendental hit".&#91;217&#93; Furthermore, Simon Parkin of The Guardian noted that whereas Miyamoto reviews every Mario game prior to release, the individuals who shaped Sonic (Naka, Ohshima, and Cerny) left Sega.&#91;221&#93;
Despite the critical decline, Dimps' side-scrolling Sonic games for the GBA and DS were consistently praised.&#91;98&#93; Writing for Destructoid, Jim Sterling said: "Hyperbole states that we haven't had a good Sonic game since Sonic Adventure, which really betrays how much we gamers ignore the handheld market... Sonic Advance and the Sonic Rush games have often ranged from decent to superb, which makes one wonder why Dimps is the 'B' team and the inferior Sonic Team is the 'A' team."&#91;394&#93; In the wake of the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog, Brett Elston of GamesRadar+ said that Sonic Rush Adventure "managed to keep the [series'] spirit alive".&#91;395&#93; While Sonic Unleashed was criticized for its addition of beat 'em up gameplay, which IGN&#39;s Hilary Goldstein bemoaned had "nothing to do with Sonic whatsoever",&#91;245&#93; its speed-based platforming levels were widely praised; critics suggested that the game would have been better received if it had focused on them.&#91;396&#93;&#91;397&#93;&#91;398&#93;
In October 2010, Sega delisted Sonic games with average or below-average scores on the review aggregator website Metacritic, to increase the value of the brand and avoid confusing customers.&#91;399&#93; That month, Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I was released to general praise,&#91;400&#93; with Goldstein summarizing it as "short but sweet and well worth downloading".&#91;401&#93; Sonic Colors, released shortly afterward, was hailed as a return to form for the series,&#91;402&#93;&#91;403&#93;&#91;404&#93; as was 2011's Sonic Generations.&#91;405&#93;&#91;406&#93; However, Evans-Thirlwell, while considering Sonic Generations the best 3D Sonic game, also called it "an admission of defeat" for depicting the 2D and 3D incarnations of Sonic "together only to remind us of their profound differences".&#91;217&#93; Sonic Lost World was released in 2013 to more mixed reviews, with some critics considering it a fresh take on the Sonic formula and others a poorly designed mess,&#91;146&#93; while the two Sonic Boom games received widespread negative reviews.&#91;407&#93;&#91;408&#93; Both became the worst-selling games in Sonic history, selling only 490,000 copies combined by February 2015.&#91;409&#93; That year, Iizuka admitted that Sonic Team had prioritized shipping games over quality and did not have enough involvement in third-party Sonic games such as Sonic Boom.&#91;132&#93; Sega CEO Haruki Satomi acknowledged that Sega in general had "partially betrayed" the trust of the longtime fans and hoped to focus on quality over quantity.&#91;410&#93;
In June 2015, the Sonic public relations manager Aaron Webber took charge of the series' Twitter account. Under Webber, the account, @sonic_hedgehog, became renowned for posting internet memes and making self-deprecating comments about the Sonic franchise's critical decline. According to Allegra Frank of Polygon, Webber "had an important effect on the franchise, cultivating a new persona for the character, one that has created a renewed sense of hope".&#91;411&#93; The announcement of Sonic Mania in 2016 brought further hope for the Sonic franchise's future. Journalists described it as a true continuation of the Genesis games, succeeding where previous Sonic games—such as Sonic Rush and Sonic 4—had failed.&#91;412&#93;&#91;413&#93;&#91;414&#93; It became the best-reviewed Sonic game in 15 years upon its August 2017 release;&#91;415&#93; Matt Espineli of GameSpot summarized it "exceed[ing] expectations of what a new game in the franchise can look and play like, managing to simultaneously be a charming celebration of the past and a natural progression of the series' classic 2D formula."&#91;416&#93; Many called it one of the best games in the series and expressed excitement for Sonic&#39;s future,&#91;416&#93;&#91;166&#93;&#91;167&#93; although Sonic Forces, released a few months later, received mixed reviews.&#91;170&#93;
Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the bestselling video game franchises. The series' cumulative sales reached 89 ;million units by March 2011&#91;417&#93;&#91;418&#93; and over 140 ;million by 2016.&#91;419&#93; The Mario &amp; Sonic series alone sold over 25 ;million units as of 2019&#91;update&#93;.&#91;420&#93; The Sonic the Hedgehog video games grossed over $5 billion in sales by 2014,&#91;421&#93; in addition to the Mario &amp; Sonic series grossing $1.25 billion as of 2019&#91;update&#93;.&#91;420&#93; Series sales and free-to-play mobile game downloads had totaled 920 ;million units as of 2019&#91;update&#93;.&#91;422&#93;
Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed greatly to the console's popularity in North America.&#91;20&#93; Between October and December 1991, the Genesis outsold its chief competitor, Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System, by a two-to-one ratio; at its January 1992 peak Sega held 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles.&#91;8&#93; Although Nintendo eventually reclaimed the number-one position, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market.&#91;456&#93; According to 1UP.com, "Sonic single handedly turned the course of the 16-bit console wars," helping Sega "[become] the dominant player for several years following" and contributing to the company's transformation into "the industry giant it is today."&#91;20&#93;
During the 16-bit era, Sonic inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots, including Bubsy,&#91;457&#93; Aero the Acro-Bat,&#91;20&#93; James Pond 3,&#91;458&#93; Earthworm Jim,&#91;459&#93; and Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel.&#91;460&#93; "Animal with attitude" games carried over to the 3D era, with the developers of Crash Bandicoot and Gex citing Sonic as a major inspiration.&#91;461&#93;&#91;462&#93;&#91;463&#93; Thorpe commented that "it's hard to keep track of how many programmers have cited [Sonic the Hedgehog] as a bar against which they have measured their own work",&#91;25&#93; while Phil Hornshaw of Complex noted that "very few" animal mascot characters managed to generate the same success as Sonic.&#91;419&#93; Regarding the series' influence on the video game industry, Thorpe wrote:
One of the world's most popular video game characters, by 1992 Sonic was considered more recognizable to children than Disney's Mickey Mouse. In 1993, Sonic became the first video game character to have a balloon in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade,&#91;20&#93; and was one of the four characters inducted on the Walk of Game in 2005, alongside Mario, Link, and Master Chief.&#91;464&#93; One of a class of genes involved in fruit fly embryonic development, called hedgehog genes, was named "sonic hedgehog" after the character.&#91;465&#93; Additionally, a Japanese team developing the Radio &amp; Plasma Wave Investigation (RPWI) instrumentation for the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft, to be launched by ESA and Airbus in 2022, received approval to use Sonic as the mascot.&#91;466&#93; Sonic and Eggman appear as minor characters in the Walt Disney Animation Studios films Wreck-It Ralph (2012) and Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018),&#91;467&#93;&#91;468&#93; while Sonic makes a cameo in Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One (2018).&#91;469&#93;
The franchise is known for its eccentric and passionate fandom, which produces unofficial media including fangames, fan fiction, modifications and ROM hacks of existing games, fan films, and fan art. Caty McCarthy of USGamer noted that many fans have continued to support the series in spite of poorly received games like the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog, and credited the fandom with helping maintain public interest in the franchise.&#91;470&#93; Notable Sonic fangames include Sonic: After the Sequel (2013), set between the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3,&#91;471&#93; and Sonic Dreams Collection (2015), which satirizes the series' fandom.&#91;472&#93; Sonic Mania&#39;s development team included individuals who had worked on Sonic ROM hacks and fangames,&#91;470&#93; while Iizuka said the character customization system in Sonic Forces was influenced by the Sonic community's tendency to create original characters.&#91;473&#93;
Sonic has inspired various internet memes,&#91;474&#93;&#91;475&#93; which have been acknowledged by Sega and referenced in games.&#91;476&#93;&#91;477&#93; "Sanic hegehog", a crude Sonic drawn in Microsoft Paint, originated in 2010;&#91;478&#93; typically, the meme uses one of Sonic's catchphrases but with poor grammar.&#91;479&#93; The Sonic Twitter account has made numerous references to it,&#91;479&#93;&#91;480&#93; and it appeared in official downloadable content for Sonic Forces on in-game shirts&#91;479&#93;&#91;481&#93; and as a visual gag in the Sonic the Hedgehog film.&#91;223&#93; Sanic also inspired similar memes and parodies, and was described by William Moo of Syfy Wire as "perfect proof of the twisted love and appreciation many have" for Sonic.&#91;479&#93; In January 2018, players flooded the virtual reality game VRChat with avatars depicting "Ugandan Knuckles", a deformed version of Knuckles the Echidna. The character stemmed from a 2017 review of Sonic Lost World by YouTube user Gregzilla, as well as fans of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds streamer Forsen, who often reference the African country Uganda.&#91;482&#93;&#91;483&#93; The Ugandan Knuckles meme was controversial for its perceived racial insensitivity,&#91;482&#93; and the creator of the avatar expressed regret over how it was used.&#91;484&#93; In response, the Sonic Twitter encouraged players to respect others and donate to a Ugandan charity through GlobalGiving.&#91;476&#93;

Total War is a series of strategy games developed by The Creative Assembly for personal computers. They combine turn-based strategy and resource management with real-time tactical control of battles. Rather uniquely for real-time strategy games, flanking maneuvers and formations factor heavily into gameplay. The first of the series, Shogun: Total War, was released in June 2000. The most recent major game released was Total War: Three Kingdoms on 23 May 2019. The series has sold over 20 ;million copies.&#91;1&#93;
Released in June 2000, Shogun: Total War is the first game in the series. The game is set in feudal Japan. The single-player game includes interactive videos that represented possible decisions by the player, such as converting to Christianity. The original Shogun was not a mainstream product, but attracted a dedicated fan base.&#91;citation needed&#93; An expansion pack, The Mongol Invasion, was released with the original in the Warlord Edition.
Medieval: Total War was released in August 2002. Using the same game engine as Shogun, the game takes players to medieval Europe. The expansion pack is called Viking Invasion, and the combined edition is called the Battle Collection. It was one of the best-selling games in the Total War series.
Released in 2004, Rome: Total War is set in the Roman Republic. This was the first game to encompass what would become one of the most fundamental additions to the Total War series, free map movement as opposed to earlier versions where all movement was province-based. The game also featured the first 3D map. The first expansion pack, Barbarian Invasion, was released on 27 September 2005. Rome: Total War Gold Edition, which combined the fully patched versions of the original game and its first expansion into one DVD (instead of the original game's three CD-ROMs), was released on 14 February 2006. A CD-ROM version (a total of four CDs) was also produced. A Mac version of Rome: Total War Gold Edition, developed by Feral Interactive, was released 12 February 2010. A second expansion pack, Rome: Total War: Alexander, was released on 19 June 2006. A compilation of the original game and the two expansions, Rome: Total War Anthology, was released on 16 March 2007. The series has also spawned several popular mods such as Europa Barbarorum and Rome: Total Realism each of which seeks to create more historically accurate settings. This game was also added to mobile, offering a simplified version of the original game. There is an estimate of about 2 ;million who own this game.&#91;citation needed&#93; Rome: Total War has won many strategy gaming awards for its realistic campaign and battlefield animation and interface.
Medieval II: Total War, a sequel to Medieval: Total War, was released on 10 November 2006 in Europe and on 14 November in North America. The game includes much more detailed characters and features the Age of Discovery (and colonisation of the Americas) and the Mongol and Timurid invasions. An expansion pack, Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms, was announced on 30 March 2007. It was released on 28 August 2007. The Gold Edition of the game, containing the original game and the expansion pack, was released on 1 February 2008. The Kingdoms expansion pack contained 4 campaigns: the Britannia Campaign, set in the British Isles in 1258, during the reign of Henry III of England; the Crusades Campaign, set in the Middle East in 1174; the Teutonic Campaign, set in the Baltic region of Eastern Europe in 1250; and the Americas Campaign, set in the New World in 1521, during the decline of the Aztec and Maya civilizations.
Empire: Total War was announced on 22 August 2007 by Sega&#91;6&#93; and had been secretly in development since the release of Barbarian Invasion.&#91;7&#93; It is set in the 18th century and includes features such as the Industrial Revolution, America's struggle for independence, and the colonization of India. For the first time in a Total War game, players have the ability to play real-time 3D naval battles. Also a feature that had been developed in the game was the decentralisation of provinces, adding greater realism in that many features, from production to technological advancement, would occur outside of the capital of the province. Empire: Total War was released on 3 March in North America and 4 March in Europe 2009.&#91;8&#93; The expansion pack, Empire: Total War: Warpath, was released in October 2009. Warpath is set in the Americas where it is possible to control one of five different Native American nations. While the game was critically acclaimed due to its innovative game play, the game has been subject to most of the criticism of the Total War series by many critics and fans after its release due to bugs; Sega claims nearly all issues have been resolved. The issues have been explained by Creative Assembly several months after the game's release. It was the first in the series to use Valve's Steamworks DRM and achievements system, thereby requiring Steam to be played.&#91;9&#93;
Napoleon: Total War was released in North America on 23 February 2010, and in Europe on 26 February. The game focuses on the politics and major military campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars in the late 18th century and the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century. Napoleon was released with several editions: the Standard Edition (as well as a limited edition version of the Standard Edition), Imperial Edition, and the Emperor's Edition (available in Australia and New Zealand only). Players assume the role of Napoleon Bonaparte or one of his major rivals on a turn-based campaign map and engage in the subsequent battles in real-time. As with its predecessor, Empire: Total War, which included a special episodic United States story line, Napoleon features three separate campaigns that follow the general's early Italian and Egyptian campaigns as well as the European campaign and the Battle of Waterloo.
In the grand campaign, "Campaigns of the Coalition", the player plays as Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, or Russia in a map that spans Europe. There is also a second campaign available as DLC, the "Peninsular campaign", in which the player vies for control of the Iberian peninsula. The campaign is playable as either France, Spain, or Great Britain. Napoleon: Total War Gold Edition premiered for Macs on 3 June 2013.
On 2 June 2010 Creative Assembly released a full preview of Total War: Shogun 2 set in the middle of the 16th century in Medieval Japan during a period of isolation and military conflict called Sengoku Jidai (the warring states period). The new battle engine supports up to 56,000 soldiers in a single battle, making them significantly larger than in Napoleon. Shogun 2 is the first game of the series to feature the franchise's name appearing as the primary title in an effort to increase brand awareness.&#91;10&#93; The game was released on 15 March 2011.&#91;11&#93;
Total War: Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai is a stand-alone expansion to Total War: Shogun 2 released in March 2012. The game explores the conflict between the Imperial throne and the last Shogun around the time of the Boshin War in 19th-century Japan, 300 years after the events of the original game in a clash of traditional Samurai culture with the power of modern weaponry. There are six new playable clans (Satsuma, Tosa, and Choshu, Imperial and Aizu, Nagaoka, and Jozai Shogunate) plus four DLC clans (Tsu, Saga, Obama, and Sendai), supporting either the Imperial throne or the Tokugawa Shogunate. Also portrayed in a limited role are Britain, United States, and France, with each of whom trade deals can be struck (given the proper infrastructure) and from whom marines can be recruited. A new feature is the land and sea unit interactions which includes the ability to call in offshore artillery support barrages, coastal gun emplacements that target enemy ships, and the ability to call in campaign map bombardments – bombarding armies and cities in adjacent coastal areas of the campaign map. Other new features are railway networks, ironclad warships, improved siege battle mechanics (with upgradable tower defenses, each with their own specialty), new agent types, the ability to control two armies on the battle map at the same time, a third-person shooter for torpedo gunboats, coastal batteries, Gatling guns and cannons, and a multiplayer overhaul.
On 2 July 2012, the Creative Assembly announced Total War: Rome II with a live-action trailer that features different scenes with the theme "How far will you go for Rome?".&#91;12&#93; Work on the title began during the development of Total War: Shogun 2.&#91;13&#93; The Creative Assembly announced that the game would have a bigger map than its predecessor, "go more to the east", have many new game features, and new camera views in-battle, allowing the player to see the battle from almost every angle. They further claimed that the game was developed using a new programming system, which allows it to achieve better graphical quality, including dynamic facial expressions.&#91;14&#93; The game was released on 3 September 2013.&#91;15&#93; This title hit record high pre-order sales for the Creative Assembly, with the Greek States Culture Pack unlocking Sparta, Athens, and Epirus in the campaign as a pre-order bonus. The initial release suffered from significant performance issues as well as having many bugs that severely affected gameplay.&#91;16&#93;
On 25 September 2014, the Creative Assembly announced Total War: Attila at the Eurogamer Expo.&#91;17&#93; Using the same engine as Total War: Rome II, the game followed the life of Attila the Hun during the Dark Ages of Europe, much like Napoleon: Total War did with Napoleon's life after Empire: Total War. According to the Creative Assembly, Total War: Attila would implement an "apocalyptic" atmosphere, with hostile weather and darker lighting. Total War: Attila was released on 17 February 2015.&#91;18&#93;
Announced on 22 April 2015, Total War: Warhammer changes the rules of the series as it takes place in a setting of high fantasy. The setting comes from Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy. The real-time battles and turn-based sandbox campaigns, a staple of the series, return. Races include the men of the Empire and Bretonnia, Orcs and Goblins (Greenskins), Dwarves, Vampire Counts, the Warriors of Chaos, Beastmen, Wood Elves, and the Norscan Tribes. Sega revealed this is the first in what will be a trilogy of titles. Total War: Warhammer was released on 24 May 2016.&#91;19&#93;
Announced on 31 March 2017 at EGX Rezzed. It was released on 28 September 2017. It focuses on the conflicts in the New World and Ulthuan between High Elves, Dark Elves, Skaven, and Lizardmen as they seek to control the Vortex. The Tomb Kings also seek to reclaim the Nine Books of Nagash, a series of necromantic tomes that hold great power. A grand campaign combining the map from the first game and the second was also released called Mortal Empires.
Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia was released on 3 May 2018. The game is set in 878 AD, after the death of Ragnar Lodbrok and subsequent Viking invasion of the British Isles by the Great Heathen Army. The game focuses on the kingdoms vying for power of the Isles. The playable factions are English, Welsh, Gaelic, part of the Great Viking army, and the Viking sea kings. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics but a mixed response from users. The game holds a Critic Score of 75 and a User Score of 54 on Metacritic.&#91;20&#93;
Released on 23 May 2019,  Three Kingdoms brings the Total War series to China during the rule of the Han dynasty in 190 AD where the child Emperor Xian of Han is placed on the throne as a puppet ruler by his regent Dong Zhuo. The game centers on heroes who fight tyranny but whose ambitions may break their fragile alliance and divide China leading up to the rise of the Three Kingdoms period. The game is based on the ancient Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Players can play warlords such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. The graphics are different. There is a new battle system enabling the player to select Records, a more realistic mode, or Romance, seen by some to be a more fun and creative way to play. In Romance, players can control their warlords who now have special abilities. The campaign has also changed. There are  three DLCs available: Eight Princes, set almost a hundred years after the original campaign; Yellow Turban Rebellion, which allows the player to play as the Yellow Turban Faction within the original campaign; Reign of Blood, similar to the other DLCs available in Total War: Rome II and Total War: Attila called Blood and Gore and Blood and Burning respectively. Reign of Blood adds a new variety of combat animations and blood on the battlefield.
Total War Saga: Troy is in development. It uses the "Saga" moniker, as did Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia and as has retroactively been applied to The Fall of the Samurai standalone expansion for Total War: Shogun 2. It is to be the first Total War game set in the Bronze Age and is scheduled for release in 2020.&#91;21&#93;
Spartan: Total Warrior was developed by The Creative Assembly and released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube. Spartan: Total Warrior is a hack-and-slash action title that was to bring Total War&#39;s hallmark large-scale battles to the console market. Rather than adhering to historical accuracies, the Creative Assembly took inspiration from Greek and Roman mythology to craft a setting that allows for more fantastical set pieces and foes. The player takes the role of a Spartan warrior guided by Ares, tasked with defeating the invading Roman Empire. The game features both a "campaign mode" and an "arena battle" mode. The campaign mode takes place over 14 levels, while the arena battle mode tasks the players with surviving enemy assaults of increasing difficulty. An indirect follow-up called Viking: Battle for Asgard was released in 2008, dropping the Total Warrior moniker.
Total War Battles: Shogun was released on 20 April 2012 for iOS.&#91;22&#93; This game was also released for Android devices and Microsoft Windows. Set in medieval Japan, the game utilizes real-time strategy and, like other Total War games, combines troop organization and management, combat, and building management. Available troops confirmed are samurai, archers, ninja, and cavalry. The battle system uses hexagon tiles for movement and placement, and a new key feature to this game enforces the "Bushido" code of conduct where once units are moved forward they can no longer move backward. 1 vs 1 local multiplayer is available.
Total War: Arena was a free-to-play game that was discontinued in February 2019.&#91;23&#93; During his session at the 2013 GDC in San Francisco, lead designer James Russell revealed the title under development at the UK studio. Arena was the Creative Assembly's first title in a free-to-play model, a new spin-off for the Total War series. Offering players the chance to pitch history's greatest commanders and their armies against each other in massive team-based battles, Arena focused entirely on online multiplayer, mixing elements of real-time strategy and multiplayer online battle arena gameplay. This game was also part of the War game series that included World of Tanks Blitz and World of Warships. It involved a system where playing online battles allowed the player to level up and select new upgraded commanders.
From the team behind Total War Battles: Shogun, Total War Battles: Kingdom entered open beta on PC on 9 March 2015,&#91;24&#93; following a limited closed beta. Set in Medieval England, the game combines realm building and management with real-time battles and has been released for PC, Android, and iOS.&#91;citation needed&#93;

Yakuza, known in Japan as Ryū ga Gotoku (龍が如く, Like a Dragon, Japanese: ;[ɾʲɨᵝː ɡa̠ go̞to̞kɯ̟ᵝ]), is an action-adventure beat 'em up video game franchise created, owned and published by Sega. The series originated from Toshihiro Nagoshi's desire to create a game that would tell the way of life of the yakuza. Nagoshi initially struggled to find a platform for the project, until Sony showed interest in the prospect.&#91;1&#93;
The series primarily focuses on the yakuza Kazuma Kiryu from the Tojo Clan. While Kiryu often assists the Tojo Clan, the series has also featured him searching for another way of life in the form of raising orphans. The gameplay of Yakuza has the player controlling Kiryu (or another character depending on the title) in an open district where he can encounter an enemy or perform an activity in the city to obtain experience.
The franchise has become a commercial and critical success, and as of 2020, Sega has reported that the Yakuza franchise has sold a combined total of 12 ;million units in physical and digital sales since its debut in 2005.&#91;2&#93; Strong sales of the games in its original Japanese market has led to the franchise's expansion to other media, including film adaptations.
The Yakuza games are primarily set in Kamurocho, a fictionalized version of the real life Kabukichō district in Tokyo. Throughout the series, characters visit other areas of Japan, such as Osaka in Yakuza 2, 5 and 0, Okinawa in Yakuza 3, Nagasugai, part of the fictional Fukuoka based on Nakasu, Tsukimino, part of the fictional Sapporo based on Susukino and Kin'eicho, part of the fictional Nagoya based on Sakae in Yakuza 5, and Hiroshima in Yakuza 6. The districts and towns in the games correlate to the appearance of each in real life during the year each game comes out, often being renovated and remodeled in new entries. Stores and buildings are often different from their real life counterparts, replacing them with real-life product placements or plot-important locations.
All Yakuza games feature three distinct yet connected modes called Event, Adventure and Battle. The main character randomly encounters foes on their path, triggering an Encounter Battle. In fights, the player character uses hand-to-hand combat, using skills such as Rush Combos, grabs, throws and Finishing Moves, and some games allow the player character to select from and use multiple fighting styles. Weapons and objects can also be wielded, though firearms are rare. Winning some of these battles can result in obtaining money or items which can be sold or used to purchase equipment or a variety of items in shops, gamble, or play mini-games. Encounter Battles caused by the story can end quicker by finishing the leader of the enemies, as well as by using powerful moves called Heat Actions, which require the filling of the 'Heat Gauge' to become usable. Some of these tend to include quick time events. As the player character fights, they gain experience that can be used to increase their stats and become a stronger fighter. The newest installment in the series, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, includes a new battle system where the player character recruits party members to fight alongside them in turn-based role-playing game battles against enemies, and to play alongside them in mini-games.
The series has a high number of entertaining sub-stories, which often complement the main story.&#91;3&#93; These give the player extra EXP. There are many mini-games, which range from activities like bowling, darts, and arcade games, to much more complex ones, like professions, which can take a number of hours over the course of several sessions to complete. Examples include:
A recurring superboss known as Amon appears in most of the games. Depending on the title, there may be more than one. For example, Yakuza 5 features an Amon for each playable character, including an idol version for Haruka to face off against.
Kazuma Kiryu (桐生 一馬, Kiryū Kazuma) is a yakuza who takes the blame for his boss' death to protect his best friend, resulting in his expulsion from the clan and a ten-year stay in prison. After leaving prison, Kiryu realizes the crime world has changed and fights against the new threats in his life. He is voiced by Takaya Kuroda in Japanese and by Darryl Kurylo in the English version of the first game. In the first three installments, the playable protagonist is Kazuma Kiryu. Yakuza 4 introduces multiple playable protagonists, which include Kazuma Kiryu, Masayoshi Tanimura, Shun Akiyama, and Taiga Saejima.&#91;5&#93; Kiryu was the only playable character in Yakuza 6.
Other characters have appeared as the protagonists of various spin-off titles. The samurai-era titles Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan! and Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin! are based around fictionalized versions of historical figures Miyamoto Musashi and Sakamoto Ryōma respectively. The Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku subseries features its own protagonist, street punk Tatsuya Ukyo, while Judgment follows private detective Takayuki Yagami.
An orphan named Haruka Sawamura (Debi Derryberry/Rie Kugimiya) who is searching for her mother, Mizuki, who Date identifies as Yumi's younger sister. In Yakuza 6 Kiryu returns to Kamurocho to search for Haruka, only to find out that she has been left in a coma after a hit and run incident, and that she has an infant son, Haruto.
Yakuza 5 continued the trend of multiple playable characters and featured five protagonists; Kazuma Kiryu, Shun Akiyama, Taiga Saejima, Tatsuo Shinada, as well as Haruka Sawamura, who up until the fifth installment was a long running supporting character.&#91;6&#93;
Introduced as a member of the Tojo clan, Majima takes an interest in the lifestyle of the protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. He continually seeks to fight against him, seeing him as a rival but still bonds with him across the franchise. Majima's character is explored in more detail during the prequel Yakuza 0, in which he is a 24-year-old former Yakuza and a playable protagonist along with Kiryu. In this game, Majima has a calmer demeanor that develops during a war between multiple families in a fight for a patch of land known as the empty lot. The prequel installment Yakuza 0 featured two protagonists, including up until this point in the series, long running supporting character Goro Majima alongside Kazuma Kiryu.&#91;7&#93; An additional story featuring a playable Majima was added to the remake of Yakuza 2, Yakuza Kiwami 2.&#91;8&#93;
The upcoming mainline installment, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, will feature a new main character, Ichiban Kasuga.&#91;9&#93; A member of Tojo Clan's Arakawa Family, Ichiban is asked by the family's patriarch Masumi Arakawa to go to prison for a murder that he didn't commit, hoping that this will make him a hero in the Tojo Clan. In 2019, Kasuga is released from prison only to find that nobody remembers him; he goes to confront Arakawa, who shoots him in the chest. Several days later, Kasuga wakes up half-naked under a pile of trash and eventually finds out that he is in the Yokohama district of Isezaki Ijincho.
Introduced in Judgement, Takayuki Yagami is a former defense attorney who resigned after a client he successfully defended killed his partner. Three years later, Yagami is a private detective in his own "Yagami Detective Agency"  and investigates a serial killer whose victims' eyes are removed from their corpses. Yagami is voiced by Takuya Kimura in Japanese and by Greg Chun in English.
As of 2020&#91;update&#93;, the Yakuza series includes eight main games, released in chronological order (with the exception of the prequel Yakuza 0), with each new installment following the events of the previous title; the series is primarily exclusive to the PlayStation series of consoles, beginning with the PlayStation 2.
There are also several spin-off titles. One, Kenzan!, relates Kazuma Kiryu's supposed ancestor, historic figure Miyamoto Musashi from the 16th and 17th centuries; another, Dead Souls, follows a zombie invasion of Kamurocho, the primary setting for the series; a PlayStation Portable spinoff series, Kurohyō, is about a teenage street fighter from Kamurocho that ends up in a fight where he kills a Tojo clan yakuza.&#91;10&#93;
With the exception of the Kurohyō: Ryū ga Gotoku titles, which were developed by Syn Sophia, all games were developed by Sega's CS1 R&amp;D team, later renamed Ryū ga Gotoku Studio.
The storytelling of the series is inspired by yakuza films, one of the most popular cinematic genres in Japan. The stories of the first two games in the series were supervised by novelist Hase Seishu, a writer of crime fiction. The main story is presented in chapters, much like Kinji Fukasaku's classic yakuza movie Sympathy for the Underdog and is expanded upon with around a hundred subplots per game. The depth this provides leads to the series having a large cast of characters, including many which recur in minor roles.
The first game follows the story of Kazuma Kiryu (桐生 一馬 Kiryū Kazuma), a formerly promising yakuza who is released from a ten-year prison sentence in December 2005, having taken the fall for the murder of his family's patriarch to protect his sworn brother. The Tojo Clan he was once a member of has had ¥10 ;billion (approximately US$100 ;million) stolen from their vault. The search for the money, undertaken by the entire Japanese underworld, results in Kiryu being forced back into the brutal, lawless world of the yakuza. A mysterious young girl would lead Kiryu to the answers, if he can keep her alive.
In December 2006, Kazuma Kiryu has left his post as the Fourth Chairman of the Tojo Clan, Japan's most violent crime syndicate. When an all-out war erupts, Kiryu must return and uphold the honor of his former clan, with brutal clashes with rival gangs, the police, and the Korean mafia through the back alleys and neon-lit nightclubs of Tokyo and Osaka.
In March 2009, Kazuma Kiryu now runs the Morning Glory Orphanage in Okinawa where he raises nine children, including his surrogate daughter Haruka Sawamura. When an impending business deal threatens to tear down the orphanage, Kiryu travels from the beaches of Okinawa to the darkest side of Tokyo as he is pulled back to a life he thought he had left behind.
In March 2010, Kazuma Kiryu is again involved in an incident in Kamurocho. First, a man is fatally shot on the turf of the powerful Tojo Clan. Then, a man investigating the murder is stabbed to death. These events spark a full-blown struggle for money, power, and above all, honor, in a story experienced through the eyes of four characters.
In December 2012, the seventh chairman of the Omi Alliance is on his deathbed. His death would end the truce between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance, leading to a war between the clans. To prepare, the Tojo Clan is forced to strengthen their organization by aligning themselves with older clans based in other major cities across Japan to create a new organization, rivaling that of the Omi Alliance. This new alliance would breach the old traditional barriers of clan territories, leading Daigo Dojima to head for Fukuoka.
In December 1988, many years before the original Yakuza, a young Kazuma Kiryu is framed for the murder of a civilian, leading him to be hunted by members of the Tojo clan. At the same time, Goro Majima finds himself protecting a helpless blind girl whom he was ordered to assassinate, making him a target himself. The two must each attempt to protect themselves and uncover the truth, including how both incidents are tied to the mysterious "Empty Lot".
In 2016, after willingly spending three years in prison for his past crimes, Kazuma Kiryu is released only to discover that his adoptive daughter Haruka has disappeared, later found comatose and critically injured after a hit-and-run incident. A devastated Kiryu decides to travel to Onomichi Jingaicho in Hiroshima, hoping to find the truth behind what happened to Haruka.
In 2019, Ichiban Kasuga, a former member of the Tojo Clan's Arakawa Family who is released after 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, ends up in Yokohama after the police and the Omi Alliance join forces.

Sega released a demo of Judgment on the Japanese PlayStation Network. The game employs a fighting system similar to the one from Yakuza 0 where players can change into different styles. Additionally, it features an investigation mode where the player has to find traces of the criminal. It was released for PlayStation 4 on December 13, 2018, with a Western release following in June 2019.&#91;21&#93;
A high-definition remaster of the first two games in the series was released in Japan on November 1, 2012 for PlayStation 3.&#91;22&#93; The high-definition remaster was ported to Wii U and released in Japan on August 8, 2013 under the title Ryū ga Gotoku 1&amp;2 HD for Wii U.&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93; Both versions of the compilation were only released in Japan.
Yakuza Kiwami, a remake of the first Yakuza game, was released in Japan on January 21, 2016 for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4; the PS4 version received a Western release in August 2017.&#91;25&#93; The two versions were the top two best-selling games in Japan during their release week, selling 103,256 copies for PlayStation 4 and 60,427 for PlayStation 3.&#91;26&#93; The game was later released for Microsoft Windows via Steam on February 19, 2019.&#91;27&#93;
Yakuza Kiwami 2, a remake of Yakuza 2, was released for the PlayStation 4 on December 7, 2017 in Japan, and in North America and Europe on August 28, 2018. The game runs on the Dragon Engine, which was previously used in Yakuza 6: The Song of Life. The remake also adds new story chapters that feature Goro Majima as a playable character, continuing stories of his that were previously established in Yakuza 0.
A compilation rerelease, titled The Yakuza Remastered Collection, was announced and released digitally in English-speaking territories on August 20, 2019 for the PlayStation 4. The collection contains the remastered versions of Yakuza 3, Yakuza 4, and Yakuza 5, which were released in Japan individually between 2018 and 2019. The remasters feature re-translated game scripts and content removed from the original English releases restored,&#91;28&#93; though some content was removed from all versions, such as a set of missions in Yakuza 3 featuring a transphobic character depiction.&#91;29&#93; At the time of the collection's launch, only Yakuza 3 was available; Yakuza 4 was released on October 29, 2019, and Yakuza 5 was released on February 11, 2020. A physical release containing all three games was released alongside Yakuza 5 with a collectible PlayStation 3 styled case for Yakuza 5, which came out digitally in the west.&#91;28&#93;
Toshihiro Nagoshi brought his story for Yakuza to scenario writer Hase Seishu two years before the game started development. Seishu had been a video game player since the days of Space Invaders, but over the past four or five years he had lost interest, as he was less concerned with 3D visuals and gameplay than he was with story. Yakuza caught his attention though, and he decided to accept the project even though it came at the busiest point of his professional writing career. Nagoshi wanted players to get enjoyment from merely walking through Kamurocho. Touching upon the game's name, Nagoshi revealed that it was his concoction. The original Japanese name Ryū ga Gotoku translates to "Like a Dragon", as Nagoshi felt that dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character.&#91;30&#93;
The game's original voice actors are Japanese celebrities which can be voice actors, singers, tarento, film or TV series actors, radio or television celebrities. Cabaret girls and alike characters have featured models, gravure idols and adult actresses as voice actresses and likenesses. Since the 2008 spin-off Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!, the game series' main characters have their face modeled in 3D after their voice actors. As in the Virtua Fighter series, Western main and minor characters do not speak in Japanese, but rather in English. Minor Chinese and Korean characters also often speak their native tongues.
The first game in the series to be released to the United States and PAL regions was dubbed in English. However, due to criticism of the English voice acting, each subsequent Western release has retained the original Japanese voice acting. Later spinoff titles such as Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and Judgment have featured dual language voiceover support.
The PlayStation 3 installments' realistic character design is based on Cyberware 3D scanner, Softimage XSI 6.5 3D models&#91;32&#93; and Sega's Magical V-Engine.
When the series was internationalized and localized to fit the Western market several changes occurred. These include changing the title of the game (Like a Dragon 龍が如く, ryū ga gotoku became Yakuza) and the names of several characters (Shintaro Kazama is Shintaro Fuma, Akira Nishikiyama is Akira Nishiki, Futoshi Shimano is Futo Shimano, Sai no Hanaya is Kage).
Yakuza 4 adjusted several of these localisation changes, following criticism of the previous games, and in particular the content excised from the Western release of Yakuza 3. Producer Noguchi noted that there was an attempt to "bring a more complete localization that was more faithful to the source material". This included reversing several name changes. In addition, some conventions were changed; in previous Western localisations, protagonist Kazuma Kiryu had been referred to primarily by his first name. In Yakuza 4, he is referred to primarily by his family name, Kiryu, which more closely reflects the original dialogue.&#91;33&#93;
The three Yakuza original soundtrack albums are composed by Hidenori Shoji, Hideki Sakamoto et alii and are published by Wave Master. Additional soundtrack features songs from Japanese artists Crazy Ken Band, Zeebra, Ketsumeishi and Eikichi Yazawa.
The Yakuza franchise includes various types of merchandise and adaptations outside of the video games. This includes a direct-to-video movie, a feature film, original soundtracks, official guides, Kamutai Magazines (pre-order campaign limited book) and other licensed products such as Cropped Heads long tee shirts and parkas based on main characters tattoos,&#91;34&#93; limited edition PlayStation 3 console packs,&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; Kubrick toys&#91;37&#93; and action figures manufactured by Maitan.&#91;38&#93;
With the original game in 2005, Sega created a pre-order campaign limited item called Kamutai Magazine (カムタイマガジン). This color book was a monography dedicated to the game with Mai, a sub-scenario female character, as the cover girl. This character's physical aspect was inspired by its voice actor, Mihiro, a Japanese adult video idol acting in porno films. Each new game release coincides with a new Kamutai Magazine issue featuring a voice actress as cover girl. Hence this December 2005 issue was followed by a December 2006 issue (cover girl is Japanese porn star Nana Natsume), a March 2008 issue (cover girl is Taiwanese porn star Yinling of Joytoy) and a February 2009 issue (cover girls are Shizuka Mutou, Sayaka Araki and Rina Sakurai). The fifth issue was bundled with Ryu Ga Gotoku 4 and released in March 2010.
Takeshi Miyasaka directed an original video during the promotion period for the western release of the game which depicted Kazuma, Nishiki and Yumi growing up at the Sunflower Orphanage and leaving for Tokyo. This short film called Like a Dragon: Prologue (龍が如く 〜序章〜, ryu ga gotoku -joshou-) serve as a prequel and set up the events which take place in the game.
A film adaptation was released in Japanese theaters on March 2, 2007, called Like a Dragon: The Movie (龍が如く 劇場版, ryu ga gotoku: gekijoban). It is based on the first installment of the series and was directed by Takashi Miike. The movie premiered in the United States on June 23 at IFC theater.&#91;39&#93; American distributor Tokyo Shock, a Media Blasters affiliate, released a licensed DVD on February 23, 2010.&#91;40&#93;
Since September 2008, Japanese voice actors from the Yakuza series, including Takaya Kuroda (Kazuma Kiryu) and Hidenari Ugaki (Goro Majima), are running a radio drama which is known as Ryu Ga Gotoku Presents Kamuro-cho Radio Station (龍が如くPresents神室町RADIOSTATION). The second season Shin Kamuro-cho Radio Station (新・神室町RADIOSTATION), which covers 2009~2010, is ongoing with back number episodes available for download as podcasts.&#91;41&#93; Past episodes from the 2008~2009 season, Kamuro-cho Radio Station (神室町RADIOSTATION), are also available as archived podcasts.&#91;42&#93;
The Kamurocho Caba Jou TV (神室町キャバ嬢 T V) is a Japanese web television dedicated to the series's cabaret girls. Main contents are audition and girls profile, but it can also be related to other aspect of the game series; for example volume 15 focuses on its soundtrack artists. All shows, called "volumes", are archived within the web TV's official website.&#91;43&#93;
The original game was heavily acclaimed in Japan for combining innovative gameplay with cinema-like storytelling and character development on the back of Japan's criminal underground.&#91;67&#93; Weekly Famitsu gave high scores to the series, Yakuza scored 37/40 (92.5/100),&#91;68&#93; Yakuza 2 scored 38/40 (95/100),&#91;69&#93; Ryū Ga Gotoku Kenzan! scored 37/40 (92,5/100),&#91;69&#93; Yakuza 3 scored 38/40 (95/100)&#91;69&#93; and Yakuza 4 scored 38/40 (95/100).&#91;70&#93; Yakuza 5 scored (40/40) which has the highest score out of all of the Yakuza installments. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life scored (39/40).
Each installment earned an excellence award at the Japan Game Awards and had a PlayStation the Best re-release in both Japanese, Asian and Korean markets.&#91;71&#93; The Japanese entertainment industry gave Yakuza 3 the "Award for Excellence" in the 2009 Japan Game Awards "Games of the Year Division" for its "dramatic story development, freedom of the story and the graphics elaborated up to the details of the work. In addition, amusement found in every portion of the game including the vast number of sub-stories and mini games. This work was awarded the prize for the high quality of entertainment".&#91;72&#93; In 2010, the Japan Game Awards once again gave a Yakuza series game the "Award for Excellence". Yakuza 4 won due to "a rich story with a high degree of freedom that is developed from the different perspectives of the 4 characters. There are also many play spots that boast several sub-stories and mini games. The astounding quality and volume provide a high level of entertainment and was the reason for granting this award".&#91;73&#93; As the protagonist of the series, Kazuma Kiryu is often recognized as a PlayStation mascot.&#91;74&#93;
The western localized versions were released between one and three years after the originals and received generally favorable reviews.&#91;75&#93;
The series sold 3.2 ;million games worldwide as of 2009&#91;76&#93; and 4 ;million copies as of September 2010;&#91;77&#93; the best sellers being the first two games which sold between 500,000 – 1 ;million worldwide, each winning the PlayStation Gold Award.&#91;78&#93; Yakuza 3 sold 500,000 copies in the Asian markets as of 2010, also winning SCEJ's PlayStation Gold Award.&#91;76&#93; However, after Yakuza 4, Sega said that sales were slow in North America and Europe due to "the adverse market condition", noting "sluggish personal consumption" in those regions.&#91;79&#93;
By June 2015, the Yakuza series sold over 7 ;million units worldwide.&#91;80&#93; As of 2019, the series has sold over 12 ;million copies.&#91;2&#93;

Sega Corporation&#91;a&#93; is a Japanese multinational video game developer and publisher headquartered in Shinagawa, Tokyo. Its international branches, Sega of America and Sega Europe, are respectively headquartered in Irvine, California, and London.  Sega's arcade division existed as Sega Interactive Co., Ltd. from 2015 to 2020.  Sega is a subsidiary of Sega Group Corporation, which is, in turn, a part of Sega Sammy Holdings.  From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed video game consoles.
Sega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as Nihon Goraku Bussan&#91;b&#93; on June 3, 1960; shortly after, the company acquired the assets of its predecessor, Service Games of Japan. Five years later, the company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd., after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of coin-operated games. Sega developed its first coin-operated game, Periscope, in the late 1960s. Sega was sold to Gulf and Western Industries in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the SG-1000 and Master System but struggled against competitors such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.  In 1984, Sega executives David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama led a management buyout of the company with backing from CSK Corporation.
Sega released its next console, the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. The Genesis struggled against the competition in Japan, but found success overseas after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, in the U.S. Later in the decade, Sega suffered several commercial failures such as the 32X, Saturn, and Dreamcast consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a third-party developer and publisher and was acquired by Sammy Corporation in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable. Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, Sega Corporation, being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed Sega Corporation.
Sega has produced several multi-million-selling game franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Total War, and Yakuza, and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates amusement arcades and produces other entertainment products, including Sega Toys. Sega is recognized for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations. In more recent years, it has been criticized for its business decisions and the quality of its creative output.
In 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert formed Standard Games in Honolulu, Hawaii. Their aim was to provide coin-operated amusement machines, including slot machines, to military bases as the increase in personnel with the onset of World War II would create demand for entertainment. After the war, the founders sold Standard Games in 1945, and in 1946 established Service Games, named for the military focus.&#91;1&#93; After the United States government outlawed slot machines in its territories in 1952, Bromley sent employees Richard Stewart and Ray LeMaire to Tokyo to establish Service Games of Japan to provide coin-operated slot machines to U.S. bases in Japan.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; A year later, all five men established Service Games Panama to control the entities of Service Games worldwide.  The company expanded over the next seven years to include distribution in South Korea, the Philippines, and South Vietnam.&#91;5&#93; The name Sega, an abbreviation of Service Games,&#91;6&#93; was first used in 1954 on a slot machine, the Diamond Star.&#91;5&#93;
Due to notoriety arising from investigations into criminal business practices, Service Games of Japan was dissolved on May 31, 1960.&#91;5&#93; On June 3,&#91;7&#93; Bromley established two companies to take over its business activities, Nihon Goraku Bussan and Nihon Kikai Seizō.&#91;c&#93; The two new companies purchased all of Service Games of Japan's assets.  Kikai Seizō, doing business as Sega, Inc., focused on manufacturing slot machines.  Goraku Bussan, doing business under Stewart as Utamatic, Inc., served as a distributor and operator of coin-operated machines, particularly jukeboxes.&#91;5&#93;&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;  The companies merged in 1964, retaining the Nihon Goraku Bussan name.&#91;5&#93;
During the same time frame, David Rosen, an American officer in the United States Air Force stationed in Japan, launched a photo booth business in Tokyo in 1954.&#91;2&#93; This company became Rosen Enterprises, and in 1957 began importing coin-operated games into Japan. In 1965, Nihon Goraku Bussan acquired Rosen Enterprises to form Sega Enterprises, Ltd.&#91;d&#93;  Rosen was installed as the CEO and managing director, while Stewart was named president and LeMaire was the director of planning.  Shortly afterward, Sega stopped leasing to military bases and moved its focus from slot machines to coin-operated amusement machines.&#91;10&#93; Its imports included Rock-Ola jukeboxes, pinball games by Williams, and gun games by Midway Manufacturing.&#91;11&#93;
Because Sega imported second-hand machines that required frequent maintenance, it began constructing replacement guns and flippers for its imported games.  According to former Sega director Akira Nagai, this led to the company developing its own games.&#91;11&#93; The first electromechanical game Sega manufactured was the submarine simulator Periscope, released worldwide in the late 1960s. It featured light and sound effects considered innovative, and was successful in Japan. It was exported to malls and department stores in Europe and the United States, and helped standardize the 25-cent-per-play cost for arcade games in the U.S. Sega was surprised by the success, and for the next two years, the company produced and exported between eight and ten games per year.&#91;12&#93; Despite this, rampant piracy in the industry would lead to Sega stepping away from exporting its games around 1970.&#91;13&#93;
In 1969, Sega was sold to the American conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries, although Rosen remained CEO.  In 1974, Gulf and Western made Sega Enterprises, Ltd., a subsidiary of an American company renamed Sega Enterprises, Inc. Sega released Pong-Tron, its first video-based game, in 1973.&#91;13&#93; Despite late competition from Taito's hit arcade game Space Invaders in 1978,&#91;11&#93; Sega prospered from the arcade game boom of the late 1970s, with revenues climbing to over US$100 ;million by 1979.  During this period, Sega acquired Gremlin Industries, which manufactured microprocessor-based arcade games,&#91;14&#93; and Esco Boueki, a coin-op distributor founded and owned by Hayao Nakayama. Nakayama was placed in a management role of Sega's Japanese operations.&#91;15&#93; In the early 1980s, Sega was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues rose to $214 ;million.&#91;16&#93;  1979 saw the release of Head On, which introduced the "eat the dots" gameplay Namco later used in Pac-Man.&#91;17&#93; In 1981, Sega licensed and released Frogger, its most successful game until then.&#91;18&#93;  In 1982, Sega introduced the first game with isometric graphics, Zaxxon.&#91;19&#93;
Following a downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982, Gulf and Western sold its North American arcade game manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing in September 1983.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;  Gulf and Western retained Sega's North American R&amp;D operation and its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd.  With its arcade business in decline, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. president Nakayama advocated for the company to use its hardware expertise to move into the home consumer market in Japan.&#91;23&#93;  This led to Sega's development of a computer, the SC-3000.  Learning that Nintendo was developing a games-only console, the Famicom, Sega developed its first home video game system, the SG-1000, alongside the SC-3000.&#91;24&#93; Rebranded versions of the SG-1000 were released in several other markets worldwide.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;  The SG-1000 sold 160,000 units in 1983, which far exceeded Sega's projection of 50,000 in the first year,&#91;24&#93; but was outpaced by the Famicom. This was in part because Nintendo expanded its game library by courting third-party developers, whereas Sega was hesitant to collaborate with companies with which it was competing in the arcades.&#91;24&#93;
In 1985, Sega began working on the Mark III,&#91;32&#93; a redesigned SG-1000.&#91;33&#93; For North America, Sega rebranded the Mark III as the Master System,&#91;34&#93; with a futuristic design intended to appeal to Western tastes.&#91;35&#93;  The Mark III was released in Japan in October 1985.&#91;36&#93;  Despite featuring more powerful hardware than the Famicom in some ways, it was unsuccessful at launch. As Nintendo required third-party developers not to publish their Famicom games on other consoles, Sega developed its own games and obtained the rights to port games from other developers.&#91;32&#93;  To help market the console in North America, Sega planned to sell the Master System as a toy, similar to how Nintendo had done with the Nintendo Entertainment System. Sega partnered with Tonka, an American toy company, to make use of Tonka's expertise in the toy industry.&#91;37&#93; Ineffective marketing by Tonka handicapped sales of the Master System.&#91;38&#93;  By early 1992, production had ceased in North America. The Master System sold between 1.5 ;million and 2 ;million units in the region.&#91;39&#93; This was less market share in North America than both Nintendo and Atari, which controlled 80 percent and 12 percent of the market respectively.&#91;40&#93; The Master System was eventually a success in Europe, where it outsold the NES by a considerable margin.&#91;41&#93;  As late as 1993, the Master System's active installed user base in Europe was 6.25 ;million units.&#91;41&#93;  The Master System has had continued success in Brazil. New versions continue to be released by Sega's partner in the region, Tectoy.&#91;42&#93; By 2016, the Master System had sold 8 ;million units in Brazil.&#91;43&#93;
During 1984, Sega opened its European division of arcade distribution, Sega Europe.&#91;44&#93;  It re-entered the North American arcade market in 1985 with the establishment of Sega Enterprises USA at the end of a deal with Bally. The release of Hang-On in 1985 would prove successful in the region, becoming so popular that Sega struggled to keep up with demand for the game.&#91;45&#93; UFO Catcher was introduced in 1985 and as of 2005 was Japan's most commonly installed claw crane game.&#91;46&#93;  In 1986, Sega of America was established to manage the company's consumer products in North America, beginning with marketing the Master System.&#91;47&#93; During Sega's partnership with Tonka, Sega of America relinquished marketing and distribution of the console and focused on customer support and some localization of titles.&#91;37&#93; Out Run, released in 1986, became Sega's best selling arcade cabinet of the 1980s.&#91;48&#93;  Former Sega director Akira Nagai stated that Hang-On and Out Run helped to pull the arcade game market out of the 1982 downturn and created new genres of video games.&#91;11&#93;
With the arcade game market once again growing, Sega was one of the most recognized game brands at the end of the 1980s. In the arcades, the company focused on releasing games to appeal to diverse tastes, including racing games and side-scrollers.&#91;49&#93; Sega released the Master System's successor, the Mega Drive, in Japan on October 29, 1988. The launch was overshadowed by Nintendo's release of Super Mario Bros. 3 a week earlier. Positive coverage from magazines Famitsu and Beep! helped establish a following, but Sega only shipped 400,000 units in the first year.&#91;50&#93;  The Mega Drive struggled to compete against the Famicom&#91;51&#93; and lagged behind Nintendo's Super Famicom and NEC's PC Engine in Japanese sales throughout the 16-bit era.&#91;52&#93;  For the North American launch, where the console was renamed Genesis, Sega had no sales and marketing organization. After Atari declined an offer to market the console in the region, Sega launched it through its own Sega of America subsidiary. The Genesis was launched in New York City and Los Angeles on August 14, 1989, and in the rest of North America later that year.&#91;53&#93;  The European version of the Mega Drive was released in September 1990.&#91;54&#93;
Former Atari executive and new Sega of America president Michael Katz developed a two-part strategy to build sales in North America. The first part involved a marketing campaign to challenge Nintendo and emphasize the more arcade-like experience available on the Genesis,&#91;53&#93;&#91;55&#93; with slogans including "Genesis does what Nintendon't".&#91;50&#93; Since Nintendo owned the console rights to most arcade games of the time, the second part involved creating a library of games which used the names and likenesses of celebrities, such as Michael Jackson's Moonwalker and Joe Montana Football.&#91;2&#93;&#91;56&#93; Nonetheless, Sega had difficulty overcoming Nintendo's ubiquity in homes.&#91;57&#93; Despite being tasked by Nakayama to sell one million units in the first year, Katz and Sega of America sold only 500,000.&#91;50&#93;
After the launch of the Genesis, Sega sought a new flagship series to compete with Nintendo's Mario series.&#91;59&#93; Its new character, Sonic the Hedgehog, went on to feature in one of the best-selling video game franchises in history.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93; Sonic the Hedgehog began with a tech demo created by Yuji Naka involving a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a winding tube; this was fleshed out with Naoto Ohshima's character design and levels conceived by designer Hirokazu Yasuhara.&#91;62&#93; Sonic's color was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo; his shoes were inspired by Michael Jackson's boots, and his personality by Bill Clinton's "can-do" attitude.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93;
Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske as CEO of Sega of America in mid-1990, and Katz departed soon after. Kalinske knew little about the video game market, but surrounded himself with industry-savvy advisors. A believer in the razor-and-blades business model, he developed a four-point plan: cut the price of the Genesis, create a U.S. team to develop games targeted at the American market, expand the aggressive advertising campaigns, and replace the bundled game Altered Beast with Sonic the Hedgehog. The Japanese board of directors disapproved,&#91;57&#93; but it was approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, "I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it."&#91;50&#93; In large part due to the popularity of Sonic the Hedgehog,&#91;57&#93; the Genesis outsold its main competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), in the United States nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season. By January 1992, Sega controlled 65 percent of the 16-bit console market.&#91;66&#93; Sega outsold Nintendo for four consecutive Christmas seasons&#91;67&#93; due to the Genesis' head start, lower price, and a larger library compared to the SNES at release.&#91;68&#93; Nintendo's dollar share of the U.S. 16-bit market dropped from 60% at the end of 1992 to 37% at the end of 1993,&#91;69&#93; Sega claimed 55% of all 16-bit hardware sales during 1994,&#91;70&#93; and the SNES outsold the Genesis from 1995 through 1997.&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93;
In 1990, Sega launched the Game Gear, a handheld console, to compete against Nintendo's Game Boy. The Game Gear was designed as a portable version of the Master System and featured a full-color screen, in contrast to the monochrome Game Boy screen.&#91;74&#93;  Due to its short battery life, lack of original games, and weak support from Sega, the Game Gear did not surpass the Game Boy, having sold approximately 11 ;million units.&#91;75&#93;  Sega launched the Mega-CD in Japan on December 1, 1991, initially retailing at JP¥49,800.&#91;76&#93;  The add-on uses CD-ROM technology. Further features include a second, faster processor, vastly expanded system memory, a graphics chip that performed scaling and rotation similar to Sega's arcade games, and another sound chip.&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93; In North America, it was renamed the Sega CD and launched on October 15, 1992, with a retail price of US$299.&#91;77&#93; It was released in Europe as the Mega-CD in 1993.&#91;76&#93;  The Mega-CD sold only 100,000 units during its first year in Japan, falling well below expectations.&#91;76&#93; Sega did have success with arcade games; in 1992 and 1993, the new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased in-house development studio Sega AM2's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter (the first 3D fighting game), which played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics.&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93;
In 1993, the American media began to focus on the mature content of certain video games, such as Night Trap for the Sega CD and the Genesis version of Midway's Mortal Kombat.&#91;83&#93;&#91;84&#93; This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an "edgy" company with "attitude", and this reinforced that image.&#91;51&#93; To handle this, Sega instituted the United States' first video game ratings system, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC), for all its systems. Ratings ranged from the family-friendly GA rating to the more mature rating of MA-13, and the adults-only rating of MA-17.&#91;84&#93; Executive vice president of Nintendo of America Howard Lincoln was quick to point out in the United States congressional hearings in 1993 that Night Trap was not rated at all. Senator Joe Lieberman called for another hearing in February 1994 to check progress toward a rating system for video game violence.&#91;84&#93; After the hearings, Sega proposed the universal adoption of the VRC; after objections by Nintendo and others, Sega took a role in forming the Entertainment Software Rating Board.&#91;84&#93;
Sega began work on the Genesis' successor, the Sega Saturn, over two years before the system was showcased at the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994.&#91;85&#93; According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama became concerned about the 1994 release of the Atari Jaguar, and that the Saturn would not be available until the next year.  As a result, Nakayama decided to have a second console release to market by the end of 1994.  Sega began to develop the 32X, a Genesis add-on which would serve as a less expensive entry into the 32-bit era.&#91;86&#93; The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but would play Genesis games.&#91;31&#93; Sega released the 32X on November 21, 1994, in North America, December 3, 1994, in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at less than half of the Saturn's launch price.&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93; After the holiday season, interest in the 32X rapidly declined.&#91;86&#93;&#91;89&#93;
Sega released the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994.&#91;90&#93; Virtua Fighter, a port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.&#91;91&#93;&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93; Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day,&#91;2&#93;&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93; and it was more popular than new competitor Sony's PlayStation in Japan.&#91;93&#93;&#91;95&#93;  In March 1995, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske announced that the Saturn would be released in the U.S. on "Saturnday" (Saturday) September 2, 1995.&#91;96&#93;&#91;97&#93; Sega of Japan mandated an early launch to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation.&#91;94&#93; At the first Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles on May 11, 1995, Kalinske revealed the release price and that Sega had shipped 30,000 Saturns to Toys "R" Us, Babbage's, Electronics Boutique, and Software Etc. for immediate release.&#91;96&#93;  The Saturn's release in Europe also came before the previously announced North American date, on July 8, 1995.&#91;98&#93;  Within two days of the PlayStation's American launch on September 9, 1995, the PlayStation sold more units than the Saturn had in the five months following its surprise launch.&#91;99&#93;&#91;100&#93; Within its first year, the PlayStation secured over 20 percent of the U.S. video game market.&#91;101&#93; The console's high price point, surprise launch causing issues with distributors and third-party developers, and difficulty handling polygonal graphics were factors in its lack of success.&#91;102&#93; Sega also underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis; sales of 16-bit games and consoles accounted for 64 percent of the market in 1995.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93; Despite capturing 43 percent of the dollar share of the U.S. market and selling more than 2 ;million Genesis units in 1995, Kalinske estimated that Sega could have sold another 300,000 consoles if it had been prepared for demand.&#91;105&#93;
Sega announced that Shoichiro Irimajiri had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America in July 1996, while Kalinske left Sega after September 30 of that year.&#91;106&#93;&#91;107&#93; A former Honda executive,&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93; Irimajiri had been involved with Sega of America since joining Sega in 1993.&#91;106&#93;&#91;110&#93; The company also announced that Rosen and Nakayama had resigned from their positions at Sega of America, though both remained with Sega.&#91;106&#93;&#91;111&#93; Bernie Stolar, a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America,&#91;112&#93;&#91;113&#93; became Sega of America's executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party relations.&#91;106&#93;&#91;107&#93; Stolar was not supportive of the Saturn, believing its hardware was poorly designed.&#91;2&#93; While Stolar had stated that "the Saturn is not our future" at E3 1997, he continued to emphasize the quality of its games,&#91;2&#93; and later reflected that "we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer".&#91;113&#93; At Sony, Stolar had opposed the localization of certain Japanese PlayStation games that he felt would not represent the system well in North America. He advocated a similar policy for the Saturn, although he later sought to distance himself from this stance.&#91;2&#93;&#91;114&#93;&#91;115&#93; Other changes included a softer image in Sega's advertising, including removing the "Sega!" scream, and holding press events for the education industry.&#91;116&#93;
Sega partnered with GE to develop the Model 2 arcade system board, building onto 3D technology in the arcade industry at the time. This led to several successful arcade games, including Daytona USA, launched in a limited capacity in late 1993 and worldwide in 1994. Other popular games included Virtua Cop, and Virtua Fighter 2.&#91;117&#93; Aside from the Saturn, Sega made forays in the PC market with the 1995 establishment of SegaSoft, which was tasked with creating original Saturn and PC games.&#91;118&#93;&#91;119&#93; In 1996, Sega operated in-door theme parks not only in Japan with Joypolis, but also overseas, with Sega World branded arcades in the UK and Australia.&#91;120&#93;&#91;121&#93; From 1994 to 1999, Sega participated in the pinball market when it took over Data East's pinball division.&#91;122&#93;
In January 1997, Sega announced its intentions to merge with the Japanese toymaker Bandai. The merger, planned as a $1 ;billion stock swap whereby Sega would wholly acquire Bandai, was set to form a company known as Sega Bandai, Ltd.&#91;123&#93;&#91;124&#93; Though it was to be finalized in October of that year, it was called off in May after growing opposition from Bandai's midlevel executives. Bandai instead agreed to a business alliance with Sega.&#91;125&#93; As a result of Sega's deteriorating financial situation, Nakayama resigned as Sega president in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri.&#91;108&#93; Nakayama's resignation may have in part been due to the failure of the merger, as well as Sega's 1997 performance.&#91;126&#93; Stolar became CEO and president of Sega of America.&#91;113&#93;&#91;127&#93;
The Saturn failed to take the lead in the market. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and its games fell sharply,&#91;113&#93; while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn three-to-one in the U.S. in 1997.&#91;101&#93;  Following five years of declining profits,&#91;128&#93; in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as both a parent company and a corporation as a whole.&#91;129&#93; Shortly before the announcement of the losses, Sega discontinued the Saturn in North America to prepare for the launch of its successor, the Dreamcast.&#91;108&#93;&#91;113&#93; The decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year.&#91;130&#93; The Saturn lasted longer in Japan and Europe,&#91;109&#93; Irimajiri telling Japanese newspaper Daily Yomiuri that Saturn development would stop at the end of 1998 and games would continue to be produced until mid-1999.&#91;131&#93; Sega suffered a further ¥42.881 ;billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce.&#91;132&#93;&#91;133&#93;  With lifetime sales of 9.26 ;million units,&#91;134&#93; the Saturn is considered a commercial failure.&#91;135&#93; Sega's arcade divisions also struggled in the late 1990s, partly due to a market slump following competition from home consoles.&#91;136&#93;
Despite a 75 percent drop in half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders.&#91;137&#93; Sega announced that Sonic Adventure, the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, would be a Dreamcast launch game. It was promoted with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall.&#91;138&#93;&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93; Due to a high failure rate in the manufacturing process, Sega could not ship enough consoles for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch.&#91;137&#93;&#91;141&#93; As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan.&#91;142&#93;  Before the launch, Sega announced the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade system board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3.&#91;143&#93; NAOMI shared technology with the Dreamcast, allowing nearly identical ports of arcade games.&#91;130&#93;&#91;144&#93;
The Dreamcast launched in Japan on November 27, 1998. The entire stock of 150,000 consoles sold out by the end of the day.&#91;142&#93; Irimajiri estimated that another 200,000 to 300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply.&#91;142&#93; He hoped to sell over 1 ;million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold.  The low sales undermined Sega's attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers.&#91;145&#93; Before the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast in Japan by JP¥9,100, effectively making it unprofitable but increasing sales.&#91;137&#93;
On August 11, 1999, Sega of America confirmed that Stolar had been fired.&#91;146&#93; Peter Moore, whom Stolar had hired as a Sega of America executive only six months before,&#91;147&#93; was placed in charge of the North American launch.&#91;146&#93;&#91;148&#93;&#91;149&#93;&#91;150&#93; The Dreamcast launched in North America on September 9, 1999,&#91;130&#93;&#91;145&#93;&#91;151&#93; with 18 games.&#91;151&#93;&#91;152&#93;&#91;153&#93; Sega set a record by selling more than 225,132 Dreamcast units in 24 hours, earning $98.4 ;million in what Moore called "the biggest 24 hours in entertainment retail history".&#91;147&#93; Within two weeks, U.S. Dreamcast sales exceeded 500,000.&#91;147&#93; By Christmas, Sega held 31 percent of the U.S. video game market by revenue.&#91;154&#93; On November 4, Sega announced it had sold over one million Dreamcast units.&#91;155&#93; Nevertheless, the launch was marred by a glitch at one of Sega's manufacturing plants, which produced defective GD-ROMs where data was not properly burned onto the disc.&#91;156&#93;  Sega released the Dreamcast in Europe on October 14, 1999.&#91;155&#93; While Sega sold 500,000 units in Europe by Christmas 1999,&#91;137&#93; sales there slowed, and by October 2000 Sega had sold only about 1 ;million units.&#91;157&#93;
Though the Dreamcast's launch was successful, Sony's PlayStation still held 60 percent of the overall market share in North America at the end of 1999.&#91;155&#93; On March 2, 1999, in what one report called a "highly publicized, vaporware-like announcement",&#91;158&#93; Sony revealed the first details of its "next-generation PlayStation".&#91;159&#93;&#91;160&#93; The same year, Nintendo announced that its next console would meet or exceed anything on the market, and Microsoft began development of its own console, the Xbox.&#91;161&#93;&#91;162&#93;&#91;163&#93;  Sega's initial momentum proved fleeting as U.S. Dreamcast sales—which exceeded 1.5 ;million by the end of 1999&#91;164&#93;—began to decline as early as January 2000.&#91;165&#93; Poor Japanese sales contributed to Sega's ¥42.88 ;billion ($404 ;million) consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 2000. This followed a similar loss of ¥42.881 ;billion the previous year and marked Sega's third consecutive annual loss.&#91;132&#93;&#91;166&#93; Sega's overall sales for the term increased 27.4 percent, and Dreamcast sales in North America and Europe greatly exceeded its expectations. However, this coincided with a decrease in profitability due to the investments required to launch the Dreamcast in Western markets and poor software sales in Japan.&#91;132&#93; At the same time, worsening conditions reduced the profitability of Sega's Japanese arcade business, prompting the closure of 246 locations.&#91;132&#93;&#91;167&#93;
Moore stated that the Dreamcast would need to sell 5 ;million units in the U.S. by the end of 2000 to remain viable, but Sega fell short of this goal with some 3 ;million units sold.&#91;154&#93;&#91;168&#93; Moreover, Sega's attempts to spur Dreamcast sales through lower prices and cash rebates caused escalating financial losses.&#91;169&#93; In March 2001, Sega posted a consolidated net loss of ¥51.7 ;billion ($417.5 ;million).&#91;170&#93; While the PlayStation 2's October 26 U.S. launch was marred by shortages, this did not benefit the Dreamcast as much as expected, as many disappointed consumers continued to wait or purchased a PSone.&#91;154&#93;&#91;171&#93;&#91;172&#93; Eventually, Sony and Nintendo held 50 and 35 percent of the U.S. video game market respectively, while Sega held only 15 percent.&#91;137&#93;
CSK chairman Isao Okawa replaced Irimajiri as president of Sega on May 22, 2000.&#91;175&#93; Okawa had long advocated that Sega abandon the console business.&#91;176&#93; Others shared this view; Sega co-founder David Rosen had "always felt it was a bit of a folly for them to be limiting their potential to Sega hardware", and Stolar had suggested that Sega should have sold the company to Microsoft.&#91;2&#93;&#91;177&#93; In a September 2000 meeting with Sega's Japanese executives and heads of its first-party game studios, Moore and Sega of America executive Charles Bellfield recommended that Sega abandon its console business.  In response, the studio heads walked out.&#91;147&#93; Sega announced an official company name change from Sega Enterprises, Ltd. to Sega Corporation effective November 1, 2000.  Sega stated in a release that this was to display its commitment to its "network entertainment business".&#91;178&#93;
On January 23, 2001, Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shinbun reported that Sega would cease production of the Dreamcast and develop software for other platforms.&#91;179&#93; After an initial denial, Sega of Japan released a press release confirming it was considering producing software for the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance as part of its "new management policy".&#91;180&#93; On January 31, 2001, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast after March 31 and the restructuring of the company as a "platform-agnostic" third-party developer.&#91;181&#93;&#91;182&#93; Sega also announced a Dreamcast price reduction to eliminate its unsold inventory, estimated at 930,000 units as of April 2001.&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93; This was followed by further reductions to clear the remaining inventory.&#91;185&#93;&#91;186&#93; The final manufactured Dreamcast was autographed by the heads of all nine of Sega's first-party game studios, plus the heads of sports game developer Visual Concepts and audio studio Wave Master, and given away with 55 first-party Dreamcast games through a competition organized by GamePro.&#91;187&#93;
Okawa, who had loaned Sega $500 ;million in 1999, died on March 16, 2001. Shortly before his death, he forgave Sega's debts to him and returned his $695 ;million worth of Sega and CSK stock, helping the company survive the third-party transition.&#91;188&#93;&#91;189&#93;&#91;190&#93; He held failed talks with Microsoft about a sale or merger with their Xbox division.&#91;191&#93; According to former Microsoft executive Joachim Kempin, Microsoft founder Bill Gates decided against acquiring Sega because "he didn't think that Sega had enough muscle to eventually stop Sony".&#91;192&#93; As part of the restructuring, nearly one third of Sega's Tokyo workforce was laid off in 2001.&#91;193&#93; 2002 was Sega's fifth consecutive fiscal year of net losses.&#91;194&#93;  After Okawa's death, Hideki Sato, a 30-year Sega veteran who had worked on Sega's consoles, became company president. Following poor sales in 2002, Sega cut its profit forecast for 2003 by 90 percent, and explored opportunities for mergers. In 2003, Sega began talks with Sammy Corporation–a pachinko and pachislot manufacturing company–and video game company Namco. The president of Sammy, Hajime Satomi, had a history with Sega, as he was mentored by Isao Okawa and was previously asked to be CEO of Sega.&#91;195&#93; On February 13, Sega announced that it would merge with Sammy but, as late as April 17, Sega was still in talks with Namco, which was attempting to overturn the merger. Sega's consideration of Namco's offer upset Sammy executives. The day after Sega announced it was no longer planning to merge with Sammy, Namco withdrew its offer.&#91;196&#93; In 2003, Sato and COO Tetsu Kamaya stepped down, Sato being replaced by Hisao Oguchi, the head of the Sega studio Hitmaker.&#91;197&#93;
After the decline of the global arcade industry around the 21st century, Sega introduced several novel concepts tailored to the Japanese market. Derby Owners Club was an arcade machine with memory cards for data storage, designed to take over half an hour to complete and costing JP¥500 to play. Testing of Derby Owners Club in an arcade in Chicago showed that it became the most popular machine in the arcade, with a 92% replay rate. While the eight-player Japanese version of the game was released in 1999, the game was reduced to a smaller four-player version due to size issues and released in North America in 2003.&#91;198&#93; Sega introduced trading card game machines, with games such as World Club Champion Football for general audiences and Mushiking: The King of Beetles for young children. The company also introduced internet functionality in arcades with Virtua Fighter 4 in 2001, and further enhanced it with ALL.Net, a network system for arcade games, introduced in 2004.&#91;199&#93;
In August 2003, Sammy bought 22.4 percent of Sega's shares from CSK, making Sammy into Sega's largest shareholder.&#91;200&#93;&#91;201&#93;  In the same year, Hajime Satomi  stated that Sega's activity would focus on its profitable arcade business as opposed to loss-incurring home software development.&#91;202&#93; In 2004, Sega Sammy Holdings, an entertainment conglomerate, was created; Sega and Sammy became subsidiaries of the new holding company, both companies operating independently while the executive departments merged.  According to the first Sega Sammy Annual Report, the merger went ahead as both companies were facing difficulties. Satomi stated that Sega had been operating at a loss for nearly 10 years,&#91;203&#93; while Sammy feared stagnation and overreliance of its highly profitable pachislot and pachinko machine business and wanted to diversify.&#91;46&#93;  Sammy acquired the remaining percentages of Sega, completing a takeover.&#91;204&#93; The stock swap deal valued Sega between $1.45 ;billion and $1.8 ;billion.&#91;203&#93;&#91;205&#93;  Sega Sammy Holdings was structured into four parts: Consumer Business (video games), Amusement Machine Business (arcade games), Amusement Center Business (Sega's theme parks and arcades) and Pachislot and Pachinko Business (Sammy's pachinko and pachislot business).&#91;206&#93;
In the console and handheld business, Sega found success with games targeted at the Japanese market such as the Yakuza and Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series while also distributing games from smaller Japanese game developers and localizations of Western games in Japan.&#91;207&#93;&#91;208&#93; Sega's most successful arcade games at the time, such as Sangokushi Taisen and Border Break, continued to be based on network and card systems. Arcade machine sales incurred higher profits than the company's console, mobile and PC games on a year-to-year basis until the fiscal year of 2014.&#91;209&#93; In 2004, the GameWorks chain of arcades came under Sega ownership, until it was sold in 2011. In 2009, Sega Republic, an indoor theme park, opened in Dubai. The next year, Sega began providing the 3D imaging for Hatsune Miku's holographic concerts.&#91;210&#93; In 2013, Index Corporation was purchased by Sega Sammy after going bankrupt.&#91;211&#93; After the buyout, Sega implemented a corporate spin-off with Index. The latter's game assets were rebranded as Atlus, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sega.&#91;212&#93;
Due in part to the decline of packaged game sales worldwide in the 2010s,&#91;213&#93; Sega began layoffs and closed five offices based in Europe and Australia on July 1, 2012.&#91;214&#93; This was to focus on the digital game market, such as PC and mobile devices.&#91;215&#93;&#91;216&#93; Strong performers for Sega on these platforms include Phantasy Star Online 2 and Chain Chronicle.&#91;217&#93; Sega gradually reduced its arcade centers from 450 in 2005&#91;218&#93; to around 200 in 2015.&#91;219&#93; In the mobile market, Sega released its first app on the iTunes Store with a version of Super Monkey Ball in 2008. The Western lineup consisted of emulations of games and pay-to-play apps. These were eventually overshadowed by free-to-play games, leading to 19 older mobile games being pulled due to quality concerns in May 2015.&#91;220&#93;&#91;221&#93; In 2012, Sega also began acquiring studios for mobile development, studios such as Hardlight, Three Rings Design, and Demiurge Studios becoming fully owned subsidiaries.&#91;222&#93;&#91;223&#93;&#91;224&#93;
To streamline operations, Sega established operational firms for each of its businesses in the 2010s. In 2012, Sega established Sega Networks as a subsidiary company for its mobile games.&#91;225&#93;  The same year, Sega Entertainment was established for Sega's amusement facility business.&#91;226&#93; In January 2015, Sega of America announced its relocation from San Francisco to Atlus USA's headquarters in Irvine, California, which was completed later that year.&#91;227&#93; From 2005 to 2015, Sega's operating income generally saw improvements compared to Sega's past financial problems, but was not profitable every year.&#91;228&#93;
Sega Sammy Holdings announced in April 2017 that it would relocate its head office functions and domestic subsidiaries located in the Tokyo metropolitan area to Shinagawa-ku by January 2018. This was to consolidate scattered head office functions including Sega Sammy Holdings, Sammy Corporation, Sega Holdings, Sega Games, Atlus, Sammy Network, and Dartslive.&#91;234&#93;  Sega's previous headquarters in Ōta was sold in 2019 and will likely be torn down.&#91;235&#93; In June 2018, Gary Dale, formerly of Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive, replaced Chris Bergstresser as president and COO of Sega Europe.&#91;236&#93;  A few months later, Ian Curran, a former executive at THQ and Acclaim Entertainment, replaced John Cheng as president and COO of Sega of America in August 2018.&#91;237&#93; In October 2018, Sega reported favorable western sales results from games such as Yakuza 6 and Persona 5, due to the localization work of Atlus USA.&#91;238&#93;
Despite a 35 percent increase in the sale of console games and success in its PC game business, profits fell 70 percent for the 2018 fiscal year in comparison to the previous year, mainly due to the digital games market which includes mobile games as well as Phantasy Star Online 2. In response, Sega announced that for its digital games it would focus on releases for its existing intellectual property and also focus on growth areas such as packaged games in the overseas market. Sega blamed the loss on market miscalculations and having too many games under development. Projects in development at Sega included a new game in the Yakuza series, Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers, the Sonic the Hedgehog film, and the Sega Genesis Mini,&#91;239&#93;&#91;240&#93; which was released in September 2019.&#91;241&#93; In May 2019, Sega acquired Two Point Studios, known for its positively reviewed Two Point Hospital.&#91;242&#93;&#91;243&#93;
On April 1, 2020, Sega Interactive merged with Sega Games Co., Ltd.  The company was again renamed Sega Corporation, while Sega Holdings Co., Ltd. was renamed Sega Group Corporation.&#91;244&#93; According to a company statement, the move was made to allow greater research and development flexibility.&#91;245&#93; In April 2020, Sega sold Demiurge Studios to Demiurge co-founder Albert Reed. Demiurge said it would continue to support the mobile games it developed under Sega.&#91;246&#93;
Sega's headquarters is in Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan.  Sega also has offices in Irvine, California (as Sega of America), in London (as Sega Europe),&#91;247&#93; in Seoul, South Korea as Sega Publishing Korea,&#91;248&#93; and in Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Taipei.&#91;249&#93;  In other regions, Sega has contracted distributors for its games and consoles, such as Tectoy in Brazil.&#91;32&#93;  Sega has had offices in France, Germany, Spain, and Australia;&#91;214&#93; those markets have since contracted distributors.&#91;250&#93;
Relations between the regional offices have not always been smooth.&#91;251&#93;  Some conflict in the 1990s may have been caused by Sega president Nakayama and his admiration for Sega of America; according to Kalinske, "There were some guys in the executive suites who really didn't like that Nakayama in particular appeared to favor the U.S. executives. A lot of the Japanese executives were maybe a little jealous, and I think some of that played into the decisions that were made."&#91;2&#93; By contrast, author Steven L. Kent stated that Nakayama bullied American executives and that Nakayama believed the Japanese executives made the best decisions. Kent also stated that Sega of American CEOs Kalinske, Stolar, and Moore dreaded meeting with Sega of Japan executives.&#91;252&#93;
Sega Toys Co., Ltd. has created toys for children's franchises such as Oshare Majo: Love and Berry, Mushiking: King of the Beetles, Lilpri, Bakugan, Jewelpet, Rilu Rilu Fairilu, Dinosaur King and Hero Bank. Products released in the West include the Homestar and the iDog. Sega Toys also inherited the Sega Pico handheld system and produced Pico software.&#91;253&#93;  Sega has operations of bowling alleys and arcades through its Sega Entertainment Co., Ltd. subsidiary.&#91;231&#93;  Since its first arcade opened in Japan in 1970, Sega has maintained a presence in operating arcades there, but has not been consistently successful in other territories.&#91;254&#93;  Its DartsLive subsidiary creates electronic darts games,&#91;249&#93; while Sega Logistics Service distributes and repairs arcade games.&#91;231&#93;  In 2015, Sega and Japanese advertising agency Hakuhodo formed a joint venture, Stories LLC, to create entertainment for film and TV. Stories LLC has exclusive licensing rights to adapt Sega properties into film and television,&#91;255&#93;&#91;256&#93; and has partnered with producers to develop series based on properties including Shinobi, Golden Axe, Virtua Fighter, The House of the Dead, and Crazy Taxi.&#91;257&#93;
As a games publisher, Sega produces games through its research and development teams. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, maintained through Sega's Sonic Team division, is one of the best-selling franchises in the history of video games.&#91;258&#93; Sega has also acquired third-party studios that are now owned by the company, including Amplitude Studios,&#91;259&#93; Atlus,&#91;212&#93; Creative Assembly,&#91;260&#93; Hardlight,&#91;224&#93; Relic Entertainment,&#91;261&#93; Sports Interactive,&#91;262&#93; and Two Point Studios.&#91;242&#93;&#91;243&#93;
Sega's software research and development teams began with one development division operating under Sega's longtime head of R&amp;D, Hisashi Suzuki. As the market increased for home video game consoles, Sega expanded with three Consumer Development (CS) divisions. After October 1983, arcade development expanded to three teams: Sega DD No. 1, 2, and 3. Some time after the release of Power Drift, the company restructured its teams again as the Sega Amusement Machine Research and Development Teams, or AM teams. Each arcade division was segregated, and a rivalry existed between the arcade and consumer development divisions.&#91;263&#93; In what has been called "a brief moment of remarkable creativity",&#91;130&#93; in 2000, Sega restructured its arcade and console development teams into nine semi-autonomous studios headed by the company's top designers.&#91;2&#93;&#91;151&#93;&#91;264&#93; The studios were United Game Artists, Smilebit, Hitmaker, Sega Rosso, Sega Wow, Overworks, Amusement Vision, Sega AM2, and Sonic Team.&#91;130&#93;&#91;265&#93; Sega's design houses were encouraged to experiment and benefited from a relatively lax approval process.&#91;266&#93; After taking over as company president in 2003, Hisao Oguchi announced his intention to consolidate Sega's studios.&#91;197&#93; Prior to the acquisition by Sammy, Sega began the process of re-integrating its subsidiaries into the main company.&#91;267&#93;
Sega still operates first-party studios as departments of its research and development division. Sonic Team exists as Sega's CS2 research and development department,&#91;268&#93; while Sega's CS3 department has developed games such as Phantasy Star Online 2,&#91;269&#93; and Sega Interactive's AM2 department has more recently worked on projects such as smartphone game Soul Reverse Zero.&#91;270&#93; Toshihiro Nagoshi, formerly the head of Amusement Vision, remains involved with research and development as Sega's chief creative officer while working on the Yakuza series.&#91;271&#93;
Sega is the world's most prolific arcade game producer, having developed more than 500 games, 70 franchises, and 20 arcade system boards since 1981. It has been recognized by Guinness World Records for this achievement.&#91;272&#93; Of Sega's arcade division, Eurogamer's Martin Robinson said, "It's boisterous, broad and with a neat sense of showmanship running through its range. On top of that, it has something that's often evaded its console-dwelling cousin: success."&#91;273&#93;
The Sega Genesis is often ranked among the best consoles in history.&#91;274&#93;&#91;275&#93;&#91;276&#93;  In 2014, USgamer's Jeremy Parish credited it for galvanizing the market by breaking Nintendo's near-monopoly, helping create modern sports game franchises, and popularizing television games in the UK.&#91;277&#93; Kalinske felt Sega had innovated by developing games for an older demographic and pioneering the "street date" concept with the simultaneous North American and European release of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.&#91;278&#93; Sega of America's marketing campaign for the Genesis influenced marketing for later consoles.&#91;279&#93;
Despite its commercial failure, the Saturn is well regarded for its library,&#91;98&#93;&#91;280&#93;&#91;281&#93; though it has been criticized for a lack of high-profile franchise releases.&#91;2&#93; Edge wrote that "hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like Burning Rangers, Guardian Heroes, Dragon Force and Panzer Dragoon Saga".&#91;282&#93; Sega's management was criticized for its handling of the Saturn.&#91;2&#93;&#91;98&#93; According to Greg Sewart of 1Up.com, "the Saturn will go down in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time".&#91;280&#93;
The Dreamcast is remembered for being ahead of its time,&#91;283&#93;&#91;284&#93;&#91;285&#93; with several concepts that became standard in consoles, such as motion controls and online functionality.&#91;286&#93; Its demise has been connected with transitions in the video game industry. In 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Duncan Harris wrote that the Dreamcast's end "signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture ;... Sega's console gave hope that things were not about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games."&#91;287&#93; Parish contrasted the Dreamcast's diverse library with the "suffocating sense of conservatism" that pervaded the industry in the following decade.&#91;288&#93;
In Eurogamer, Damien McFerran wrote that Sega's decisions in the late 1990s were "a tragic spectacle of overconfidence and woefully misguided business practice".&#91;51&#93;  Travis Fahs of IGN noted that since the Sammy takeover Sega had developed fewer games and outsourced to more western studios, and that its arcade operations had been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, he wrote: "Sega was one of the most active, creative, and productive developers the industry has ever known, and nothing that can happen to their name since will change that."&#91;2&#93; In 2015, Sega president Haruki Satomi told Famitsu that, in the previous ten years, Sega had "betrayed" the trust of older fans and that he hoped to re-establish the Sega brand.&#91;289&#93; During the promotion of the Sega Genesis Mini, Sega executive manager Hiroyuki Miyazaki reflected on Sega's history, saying, "I feel like Sega has never been the champion, at the top of all the video game companies, but I feel like a lot of people love Sega because of the underdog image."&#91;290&#93; In his 2018 book The Sega Arcade Revolution, Horowitz connected Sega's decline in the arcades after 1995 with broader industry changes. He argued that its most serious problems came from the loss of its creative talent, particularly Yuji Naka and Yu Suzuki, after the Sammy takeover, but concluded that "as of this writing, Sega is in its best financial shape of the past two decades. The company has endured."&#91;291&#93;

Adore is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on June 2, 1998 by Virgin Records. After the multi-platinum success of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and a subsequent yearlong world tour, follow-up Adore was considered "one of the most anticipated albums of 1998" by MTV.&#91;5&#93; Recording the album proved to be a challenge as the band members struggled with lingering interpersonal problems and musical uncertainty in the wake of three increasingly successful rock albums and the departure of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin.&#91;6&#93; Frontman Billy Corgan would later characterize Adore as "a band falling apart".&#91;7&#93; Corgan has also mentioned he was going through a divorce while recording the album.
The result was a much more subdued and electronica-tinged sound that Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine called "a complete break with the past".&#91;8&#93; The album divided the fan base and sold only a fraction of the previous two albums. However, the album was well received by critics, and became the third straight Pumpkins album to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance&#91;9&#93; and has gained a cult following. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released on CD and vinyl in September 2014 as a part of the band's project to reissue their back catalogue from 1991–2000.
During this period, the band released two new singles on movie soundtracks—"Eye" and "The End Is the Beginning Is the End". Both songs incorporated electronic elements, yet retained the hard rock elements of the band's previous material; one reviewer called the two singles "balls-out, full-energy chargers" and wrote off the Pumpkins' previous remarks that the upcoming album would "rock" less.&#91;14&#93; However, the new album material Corgan was writing consisted mainly of simple acoustic songs.&#91;13&#93; Corgan, James Iha, D'arcy Wretzky, and Matt Walker spent a few days in the studio in February 1997 laying down demos mostly as live takes, and the band hoped to quickly record an entire album in such a manner.&#91;13&#93; Corgan, hoping to maintain the band's progressive rock-inspired experimentation, soon had second thoughts about this approach and began envisioning a hybrid of folk rock and electronica that was at once "ancient" and "futuristic".&#91;13&#93;
The Smashing Pumpkins started demoing in February 1997 and recorded 30 songs for the album which, at one point, looked set to be a double album. The band subsequently cut the number of tracks on the album to 14.&#91;15&#93;
After playing several festival dates in summer 1997, the band began working at a variety of Chicago studios with producer Brad Wood—with whom Corgan previously had worked in the early 1990s.&#91;16&#93; While Mellon Collie had mostly been recorded with the full participation of all the band members, the band dynamics during the new sessions soon muddled as Corgan, uninspired by his bandmates, worked mostly alone.&#91;13&#93; Wood, too, was leaving Corgan unsatisfied, so, after six weeks in Chicago, the band—minus Wood and Matt Walker—relocated to Los Angeles and started work at Sunset Sound, with Corgan now the de facto producer.&#91;13&#93;&#91;17&#93;
The band rented a house, and hoped living communally would foster good relations and a happier recording environment.&#91;18&#93; According to Corgan, Iha refused to live in the house and rarely visited.&#91;18&#93; The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical.&#91;19&#93; In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation.&#91;18&#93; The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93; Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.&#91;22&#93;
At the behest of the band's management, Rick Rubin was brought in to produce one song, "Let Me Give the World to You", but the song was left off the album, later to be re-recorded for Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music.&#91;23&#93; With around thirty songs recorded, Corgan began to see an end, and enlisted Mellon Collie co-producer Flood to help finish the recording, pull the album together, and mix the songs.&#91;19&#93;
Art direction for the album is credited to Frank Olinsky, Billy Corgan, and Corgan's then-girlfriend and frequent collaborator Yelena Yemchuk. The artwork for the album and its singles consisted almost entirely of black-and-white photographs shot by Yemchuk, many of which featured model Amy Wesson.&#91;24&#93;
Corgan was deliberately setting out to widen his band's sound and message, explaining that he was not "talking to teenagers anymore. I'm talking to everyone now. It's a wider dialogue. I'm talking to people who are older than me and younger than me, and our generation as well."&#91;17&#93; He said much of the record was "an attempt to go back to what's important at a musical core and build it outward".&#91;25&#93; He would later reflect that he was "stuck on the idea that [he] needed to prove [he] was an artist, which is the death knell of any artist".&#91;26&#93;
Distorted guitars and live drums, the previous hallmarks of the Pumpkins sound, took a back seat in a sonic palette that included much more synthesizers, drum programming, acoustic guitar, and piano.&#91;8&#93; At least five songs on the album are driven chiefly by piano.&#91;8&#93;
"Tear" was written for the Lost Highway soundtrack, but was rejected by David Lynch in favor of "Eye".&#91;27&#93; "Pug" was originally recorded as a "minor key blues death march" with drums by Matt Cameron, while the album version uses drum programming.&#91;23&#93; The only song on the album to feature Cameron, "For Martha", is a tribute to Corgan's mother that was primarily recorded as one live take.&#91;19&#93;
Apart from being the first album without Jimmy Chamberlin, Adore was the first album to not include writing contributions from James Iha,&#91;24&#93; who was concurrently working on his solo album Let It Come Down. However, he did contribute the track "Summer" to the "Perfect" single.&#91;24&#93;
The lead-up to Adore was marked by conflicting statements as to the album's sound—Corgan initially said the band was heading in the direction of the heavy-metal-guitar-and-electronic music-driven "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" in summer 1997.&#91;28&#93; while the band's management reported the album would be all-acoustic.&#91;29&#93; In early 1998, Corgan called the sound "arcane night music",&#91;30&#93; elaborating, "The people that say it's acoustic will be wrong. The people that say it's electronic will be wrong. The people that say it's a Pumpkins record will be wrong. I will try to make something that is indescribable".&#91;31&#93; Further complicating the situation was the record label's initial insistence to use the Rick Rubin produced, upbeat, poppy song "Let Me Give the World to You" as the album's lead single, something Corgan strongly objected to, fearing it would give listeners the wrong first impression of the album.&#91;32&#93; Corgan had to drop the song off the track list altogether to avoid using it as a single.&#91;32&#93;
Adore was released on June 2, 1998, in most of the world, the same day the video for first single "Ava Adore" premiered. The album booklet and music video showcased the band's new gothic look. The second single, "Perfect", was also accompanied by a music video, which debuted on August 16.&#91;33&#93;
After the release of Adore, the band embarked on a scaled-back 14-show world tour entitled An Evening with The Smashing Pumpkins to support Adore.&#91;34&#93; Abroad, the Pumpkins played at what had been called an "eclectic mix of interesting venues",&#91;35&#93; among them the rooftop of a FNAC record store in Paris, France,&#91;36&#93; in the botanic gardens of Brussels, Belgium,&#91;37&#93; at the Cannes Film Festival,&#91;38&#93; and at an International Shipping Harbor in Sydney, Australia.&#91;39&#93; In the United States, the Pumpkins donated 100% of their ticket profits to local charities&#91;40&#93; (yet one stop on the tour, Minneapolis, was a free concert and underestimated the attendance of the show).&#91;41&#93; In the end, the Pumpkins, with the help of their fans, raised over $2.8 ;million in this manner.&#91;42&#93;
The lineup was the most expansive yet, including former John Mellencamp and Melissa Etheridge drummer Kenny Aronoff,&#91;43&#93; percussionists Dan Morris and Stephen Hodges, and David Bowie pianist Mike Garson.&#91;44&#93; Violinist Lisa Germano was also set to appear,&#91;45&#93; but did not ultimately appear in the touring line-up. The set was mainly Adore material, with only a handful of reworked Mellon Collie songs and no songs from prior to 1995, eliminating many of their radio hits and fan favorites,&#91;34&#93; with the exception of some shows performed in South American countries like Brazil and Chile, where they played for the first time, so they included old hits like "Today" and "Disarm".&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;
In retrospect, Corgan regretted the decision to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what he was feeling, so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician."&#91;48&#93;
Critical reception to Adore was generally positive. Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine regarded Adore as "the most intimate album the Pumpkins have ever made and also the prettiest, a parade of swooning melodies and gentle, unfolding nocturnes".&#91;8&#93; Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork described the album as "the Pumpkins' best offering since Siamese Dream".&#91;14&#93; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Adore as "a hushed, elegiac album that sounds curiously out of time".&#91;3&#93; Adore was considered one of "an inspiring range of 25 classic alternative American albums" by The Guardian.&#91;56&#93; The lyrics received particular praise from critics—Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times, who in 1993 had criticized Corgan's lyrics as "too often sound[ing] like sophomoric poetry",&#91;57&#93; said Corgan "took a big leap forward as a lyricist" starting with Adore.&#91;58&#93; Schreiber, who criticized Mellon Collie as "lyrical rock-bottom",&#91;59&#93; called Adore&#39;s lyrics "poetic", particularly singling out "To Sheila".&#91;14&#93; Greg Kot emphasized the "oblique, private longings, and weighty, sometimes awkward conceits" in the lyrics,&#91;8&#93; while David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called them "unsettled and unsettling".&#91;50&#93; The contributions of Wretzky and Iha also received praise, with Kot noting that "Iha's quirky guitar accents and Wretzky's unflashy resolve [...] give Adore a warmth and camaraderie no other Pumpkins album can match."&#91;60&#93;
Corgan blamed himself for the record's reception with the public, saying he "made the mistake of telling people it was a techno record" and that if he "would have told everyone Adore was the Pumpkins' acoustic album we would have never had the problems that we had".&#91;64&#93; Corgan wrote on the band's website that the album's title was "misunderstood" and "a joke that no one ever got", explaining that Adore was meant as a play on "A Door", meaning the album would offer a new entrance to the band's career.&#91;65&#93; In 2005, Corgan would call the making of the album "one of the most painful experiences of my life".&#91;18&#93;
As part of Virgin/Universal Music's reissue campaign, a special edition of the album was released on September 23, 2014.&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93; The release consists of the original album remastered and 91 bonus tracks of previously unreleased material, demos and alternate versions of Adore-era songs, and was released in five formats; the physical box set containing all 107 tracks, the digital deluxe edition containing 74 of the bonus tracks, as well as single disc CD and double-LP versions containing only the stereo remaster of the album.&#91;66&#93; The digital version of the reissue was released on October 3, 2014.&#91;68&#93;
The actual Adore album was remastered by Bob Ludwig. The entire set includes session outtakes and a mono version of the album, with Corgan saying the new mixes contain "elements from the original sessions that were stored digitally, but never used; such as some of the work done by Bon Harris".&#91;69&#93;
The package also includes a DVD consisting of footage of the band's show from August 4, 1998, at the Fox Theater in Atlanta, Georgia.&#91;66&#93;

SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse ("HMS Emperor William the Great")&#91;a&#93; was a German pre-dreadnought battleship of the Kaiser Friedrich III&#x20;class, built around the turn of the 20th century. The ship was one of the first battleships built by the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) as part of a program of naval expansion under Kaiser Wilhelm II. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&#91;b&#93; was built in Kiel at the Germaniawerft shipyard. She was laid down in January 1898, launched in June 1899, and completed in May 1901. The ship was armed with a main battery of four 24-centimeter (9.4 ;in) guns in two twin turrets.
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse served in the main fleet—the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet) and later the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet)—for the first seven years of her career. She participated in several of the fleet's training cruises and maneuvers, primarily in the North and Baltic Seas. Her peacetime career was relatively uneventful and she suffered no accidents. She was decommissioned for a major reconstruction in 1908–10, after which she was assigned to the Reserve Division with her four sister ships, essentially obsolete by that time.
At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet and deployed to coastal defense in the North Sea. They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic but saw no action. In 1915, the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was used as a depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship. After the war, the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for scrap to a German company and broken up in 1920.
After the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) ordered the four Brandenburg-class battleships in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The former Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), Leo von Caprivi, became the Chancellor of Germany in 1890, and Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann became the new Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt. Hollmann requested the first Kaiser Friedrich III-class&#x20;battleship in 1892, but the Franco-Russian Alliance, signed the year before, put the government's attention on expanding the Army's budget. Parliamentary opposition forced Hollmann to delay until the following year, when Caprivi spoke in favor of the project, noting that Russia's recent naval expansion threatened Germany's Baltic Sea coastline. In late 1893, Hollmann presented the Navy's estimates for the 1894–1895 budget year, and now the Reichstag approved the new ship; a second member of the class followed in early 1896, and the third ship, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, was authorized for the following year's budget.&#91;1&#93;
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was 125.3 ;m (411 ;ft 1 ;in) long overall and had a beam of 20.4 ;m (66 ;ft 11 ;in) and a draft of 7.89 ;m (25 ;ft 11 ;in) forward and 8.25 ;m (27 ;ft 1 ;in) aft. She displaced 11,097 ;t (10,922 long tons) as designed and up to 11,785 ;t (11,599 long tons) at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines that drove three screw propellers. Steam was provided by four Marine-type and eight cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&#39;s powerplant was rated at 13,000 metric horsepower (12,822 ;ihp; 9,561 ;kW), which generated a top speed of 17.5 knots (32.4 ;km/h; 20.1 ;mph). She had a cruising radius of 3,420 ;nmi (6,330 ;km; 3,940 ;mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19 ;km/h; 12 ;mph). She had a normal crew of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men.&#91;2&#93;
The ship's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 ;cm (9.4 ;in) SK L/40 guns in twin turrets,&#91;c&#93; one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 ;cm (5.9 ;inch) SK L/40 guns and twelve 8.8 ;cm (3.45 ;in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns. She also carried twelve 3.7 ;cm (1.5 ;in) machine cannon. Six 45 ;cm (17.7 ;in) torpedo tubes were mounted in above-water swivel mounts. The ship's belt armor was 300 ;mm (11.8 ;in) thick, and the main armor deck was 65 ;mm (2.6 ;in) thick. The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 250 ;mm (9.8 ;in) of armor, and the secondary casemates received 150 ;mm (5.9 ;in) of protection.&#91;2&#93;
Kaiser Wilhelm II, the emperor of Germany, believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe. He initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s; the first battleships built under this program were the four Brandenburg-class ships. These were immediately followed by the five Kaiser Friedrich III-class battleships, of which Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was the third.&#91;4&#93; Her keel was laid on 22 January 1898 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel,&#91;5&#93; as construction number 22. She was ordered under the contract name Ersatz König Wilhelm,&#91;d&#93; to replace the obsolete armored frigate König Wilhelm.&#91;2&#93; Her scheduled launching on 29 April 1899 was delayed to 1 June after a large fire at the shipyard damaged the slipway. Louise, the Grand Duchess of Baden, christened the ship after her father Wilhelm I of Germany, the ship's namesake. Wilhelm II gave the launching speech for the ship commemorating his grandfather. After completing fitting-out work, dockyard sea trials began on 19 February 1901, followed by acceptance trials that started on 18 March. These were completed by May, and she was formally commissioned on 5 May.&#91;5&#93; That year, Erich Raeder—who went on to command the Kriegsmarine in World War II—was promoted to serve as a watch officer aboard her.&#91;6&#93;
After commissioning in 1901, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse joined her sister ships in I Squadron of the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet).&#91;7&#93; After her sister Kaiser Friedrich III ran aground and had to be docked for repairs, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse replaced her as the I Squadron flagship, which was commanded by Prince Heinrich, the brother of Wilhelm II. She held this post until 24 October, when Kaiser Friedrich III returned to service. In the meantime, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was present for the Kiel Week sailing regatta in June and the dedication of a monument at the Marineakademie (Naval Academy) in Kiel.&#91;5&#93; At the end of July, she led the squadron on a cruise to Spanish waters, and while docked in Cádiz, they rendezvoused with the Brandenburg-class battleships returning from East Asian waters. I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August, though the late arrival of the Brandenburgs delayed the participation of I Squadron in the annual autumn fleet training. The maneuvers began with exercises in the German Bight, followed by a mock attack on the fortifications in the lower Elbe. Gunnery drills took place in Kiel Bay before the fleet steamed to Danzig Bay, where the maneuvers concluded on 15 September. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and the rest of I Squadron went on their normal winter cruise to Norway in December, which included a stop at Oslo from 7 to 12 December.&#91;8&#93;
On 13 December, the new battleship Wittelsbach ran aground off Korsør; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse took her under tow back to port.&#91;5&#93; I Squadron went on a short cruise in the western Baltic, then embarked on a major cruise around the British Isles, which lasted from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July. The annual fleet maneuvers began in August in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade.&#91;9&#93; During the exercises, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was assigned to the "hostile" force, as were several of her sister ships. The "hostile" force was first tasked with preventing the "German" squadron from passing through the Great Belt in the Baltic. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River, where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized. The "hostile" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days.&#91;10&#93; The regular winter cruise followed during 1–12 December.&#91;9&#93;
In 1903, the fleet, which was composed of only one squadron of battleships, was reorganized as the "Active Battle Fleet". Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse remained in I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest Wittelsbach-class battleships, while the older Brandenburg-class ships were placed in reserve to be rebuilt.&#91;11&#93; The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises. The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain from 7 May to 10 June. In July, I Squadron went on its annual cruise to Norway.&#91;9&#93; The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September.&#91;12&#93; The winter cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak on 1 December.&#91;13&#93;
I Squadron held its first exercise of 1904 in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January. Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March. A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May, and in July I Squadron and I Scouting Group visited Britain, stopping at Plymouth on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when it departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports.&#91;14&#93; The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. The fleet then began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major landing operation, after which the ships took the ground troops from IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further landing operations with IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end.&#91;15&#93; I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.&#91;16&#93;
The ships of I Squadron went on a pair of training cruises during 9–19 January and 27 February ;– 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The summer cruise ended on 9 August; the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, Swinemünde, and Flensburg, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; Kaiser Wilhelm II and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit's impact was lessened by the ongoing Anglo-German naval arms race.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe.&#91;19&#93; During the exercises, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse won the Kaiser's Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in I Squadron.&#91;5&#93; In October, the ship was reassigned to I Division of II Squadron.&#91;20&#93; In early December, I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. On the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.&#91;21&#93;
Over the winter of 1906–07, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse underwent a major overhaul in Kiel, which was completed by the end of April.&#91;5&#93; By this time, the newest Deutschland-class battleships were coming into service; along with the Braunschweig-class battleships, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. As a result, the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet).&#91;11&#93; Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic.&#91;21&#93; The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernförde Bay outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel.&#91;22&#93; The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days.&#91;23&#93;
A shorter period of dockyard work took place from 7 December to 27 January 1908. She returned to the fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises, and after the conclusion of the autumn maneuvers, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September. She was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910.&#91;5&#93; During the refit, four of the ship's 15 ;cm guns and the stern-mounted torpedo tube were removed. Two 8.8 ;cm guns were added and the arrangement of the 8.8 ;cm battery was modified.&#91;24&#93; Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively,&#91;25&#93; and the ship's funnels were lengthened.&#91;24&#93; After reconstruction, the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic, along with her sister ships. She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises, then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division. She remained there for the rest of her peacetime career.&#91;5&#93;
As a result of the outbreak of World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The ships were prepared for war very slowly, and were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August.&#91;26&#93; They were initially tasked with coastal defense, but they served in this capacity for a very short time.&#91;7&#93; In mid-September, V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Heinrich. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault against the Russians at Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September.&#91;27&#93; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse  and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic.&#91;28&#93;
Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters.&#91;28&#93; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse first went to Hamburg, where her crew was reduced on 5 March. She was moved to Kiel on 30 April, where the rest of her crew were removed. She was disarmed and thereafter used as a depot ship.&#91;29&#93; The following year, the ship was used as a torpedo target ship.&#91;30&#93; In November 1918, Germany surrendered and signed the Armistice at Compiègne that ended the fighting. According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, that formally ended the war, Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the "Deutschland or Lothringen types".&#91;31&#93; On 6 December 1919, the vessel was struck from the naval list and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Berlin. The following year, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was broken up for scrap metal in Kiel-Nordmole.&#91;30&#93;

The scientists at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire included William Penney, William Cook, Ken Allen, Samuel Curran,  Henry Hulme, Bryan Taylor and John Ward. They did not know how to build a hydrogen bomb, but produced three designs: Orange Herald, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. The first series of Operation Grapple tests involved Britain's first airdrop of a thermonuclear bomb. Although hailed as a success at the time, the first test of the Green Granite design was a failure. The second test validated Orange Herald as a usable design of a megaton weapon, but it was not a thermonuclear bomb, and the core boosting did not work. A third test attempted to correct the Green Granite design, but was another failure.
In the Grapple X test in November 1957, they successfully tested a thermonuclear design. The Grapple Y test the following April obtained most of its yield  from nuclear fusion, and the Grapple Z test series later that year demonstrated a mastery of thermonuclear weapons technology. An international moratorium on nuclear tests commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good. The successful development of the hydrogen bomb, along with the Sputnik crisis, resulted in the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, in which the nuclear Special Relationship was restored.
The neutron was discovered by James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in February 1932,&#91;2&#93; and in April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split lithium atoms with accelerated protons.&#91;3&#93; In December 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at Hahn's laboratory in Berlin-Dahlem bombarded uranium with slow neutrons,&#91;4&#93; and discovered that barium had been produced, and therefore that the uranium nucleus had been split.&#91;5&#93; Hahn wrote to his colleague Lise Meitner, who, with her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, developed a theoretical explanation of the process.&#91;6&#93; By analogy with the division of biological cells, they named the process "fission".&#91;7&#93;
The discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created.&#91;8&#93; Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, both German refugee scientists working in Britain, calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as 1 to 10 kilograms (2.2 to 22.0 ;lb) would suffice, and would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; The MAUD Committee was established to investigate further.&#91;11&#93; It reported that an atomic bomb was technically feasible, and recommended pursuing its development as a matter of urgency.&#91;12&#93;&#91;13&#93; A new directorate known as Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys.&#91;14&#93;
In July 1940, Britain offered the United States access to its scientific research,&#91;15&#93; and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments.&#91;16&#93; He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.&#91;12&#93; The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts,&#91;17&#93; ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.&#91;18&#93;
The United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart.&#91;19&#93; The British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.&#91;20&#93; At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged the two national projects.&#91;21&#93; The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate their efforts.&#91;22&#93; The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.&#91;23&#93;
A British mission led by Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York.&#91;24&#93; Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory.&#91;25&#93; Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory.&#91;26&#93; A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership,&#91;29&#93; and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.&#91;30&#93;
With the end of the war the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States became, in the words of Margaret Gowing, "very much less special".&#91;31&#93; The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery.&#91;32&#93; On 8 August 1945 the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, sent a message to President Harry Truman in which he referred to both of them as "heads of the Governments which have control of this great force".&#91;32&#93;
On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.&#91;33&#93;&#91;34&#93; A Memorandum of Intention they signed replaced the Quebec Agreement.&#91;35&#93; The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes were soon disappointed.&#91;36&#93; The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), which was signed into law by Truman on 1 August 1946,&#91;37&#93; ended technical cooperation. Its control of "restricted data" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information.&#91;38&#93;
This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who had worked in the Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.&#91;39&#93; It was but the first of a series of spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950,&#91;40&#93; and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements.&#91;41&#93; The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.&#91;42&#93;
Attlee set up a cabinet sub-committee, the Gen 75 Committee (known informally by Attlee as the "Atomic Bomb Committee"),&#91;43&#93; on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of an independent British nuclear weapons programme.&#91;44&#93; The Chiefs of Staff Committee considered the issue of nuclear weapons in July 1946, and recommended that Britain acquire them.&#91;45&#93;  A nuclear reactor and plutonium-processing facility was approved by the Gen 75 committee on 18 December 1945 "with the highest urgency and importance".&#91;46&#93;  The decision to proceed was formally made on 8 January 1947 at a meeting of Gen 163, another cabinet subcommittee,&#91;47&#93; and was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948. D notice No. 25 forbid the publication of details on the design, construction or location of atomic weapons.&#91;48&#93;&#91;49&#93; The project was given the cover name "High Explosive Research".&#91;50&#93;
Production facilities were constructed under the direction of Christopher Hinton, who established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire.&#91;51&#93; These included a uranium metal plant at Springfields,&#91;52&#93; nuclear reactors and a plutonium processing plant at Windscale,&#91;53&#93; and a gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment facility at Capenhurst, near Chester.&#91;54&#93;  Uranium ore was stockpiled at Springfields. As the American nuclear programme expanded, its requirements became greater than the production of the existing mines. To gain access to the stockpile, they reopened negotiations, which resulted in the 1948 Modus Vivendi,&#91;55&#93; which allowed for consultation on the use of nuclear weapons, and limited sharing of technical information.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;
As Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced "Caesar"),  Penney directed bomb design from Fort Halstead.&#91;58&#93; In 1951 his design group moved to a new site at Aldermaston in Berkshire.&#91;59&#93; The first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in Operation Hurricane on 3 October 1952.&#91;60&#93; Britain thereby became the third country to test nuclear weapons.&#91;61&#93;  The first Blue Danube atomic bombs were delivered to Bomber Command in November 1953,&#91;62&#93; although the V bombers to deliver them to their targets were not available until 1955.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93; In the meantime, nuclear deterrence was provided by the United States Strategic Air Command,&#91;65&#93; which had begun operating from British bases in 1949.&#91;66&#93;
The successful test of an atomic bomb represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power, reaffirming its status as a great power, but hopes that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to restore the Special Relationship were soon dashed.&#91;67&#93; On 1 November 1952, the United States conducted Ivy Mike, the first successful test of a true thermonuclear device (also known as a hydrogen bomb). Due to its physical size and use of cryogenic liquid deuterium, it was not suitable for use as a deliverable weapon, but the Castle Bravo test on 1 March 1954 used a much smaller device with solid lithium deuteride. Boosted by the nuclear fusion reaction in lithium-7, the yield of 15 megatonnes of TNT (63 ;PJ)  was more than twice what had been expected, and indeed was the largest detonation the Americans would ever carry out. This resulted in widespread radioactive fallout that affected 236 Marshall Islanders, 28 Americans, and the 23 crewmen of a Japanese fishing boat, the Daigo Fukuryū Maru (Lucky Dragon No. 5).&#91;68&#93; Meanwhile, the Soviet Union tested Joe 4, a boosted fission weapon with a yield of 400 kilotonnes of TNT (1,700 ;TJ) on 12 August 1953. This was followed by Joe 19, a true two-stage thermonuclear weapon on 20 November 1954.&#91;69&#93;
Although the British Hurricane device was more advanced than the American Fat Man bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology,&#91;70&#93; and while British and Soviet advances had taken much of the heat out of American opposition to renewed cooperation with the British,&#91;71&#93; the United States Congress saw little benefit in it for the United States.&#91;69&#93; The McMahon Act was amended by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 on 30 August, which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,&#91;72&#93; but it fell far short of what the British government wanted.&#91;73&#93; Churchill, who had replaced Attlee as prime minister,&#91;74&#93; turned to Lord Cherwell for advice on the prospect of producing a British hydrogen bomb. Cherwell reported that "We think we know how to make an H-bomb",&#91;75&#93; but Penney did not agree with this sanguine assessment.&#91;76&#93;
A New Weapons Committee was established at Aldermaston on 15 October 1951 to examine improvements to their atomic bombs. John Corner, the head of the theoretical group at Aldermaston, suggested producing a device in the "megaton range"—one with a yield of 500 kilotonnes of TNT (2,100 ;TJ) or more. In this he was thinking not of a thermonuclear weapon, but of a large fission one. The idea was not pursued at that time, because the RAF wanted more, not bigger, atomic bombs.&#91;77&#93; Meeting in Bermuda in December 1953 with Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had replaced Truman as president earlier that year, Churchill told him that the RAF had reckoned that fission bombs would be sufficient for most targets, and therefore that Britain had no intention of developing hydrogen bombs.&#91;78&#93;
There was another political consideration. The Lucky Dragon incident had touched off a storm of protest, and there were calls from trade unions and the Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing,&#91;83&#93; resulting in an acrimonious debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new Eisenhower administration in the United States looked favourably on the idea of a moratorium, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles.&#91;84&#93; The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; but it would also lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.&#91;85&#93;
The Defence Policy Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister and consisting of the senior Cabinet members, considered the political and strategic implications on 1 June, and concluded that "we must maintain and strengthen our position as a world power so that Her Majesty's Government can exercise a powerful influence in the counsels of the world."&#91;1&#93; Churchill informed Cabinet of the decision on 7 July 1954, and they were not happy about not being consulted, particularly the Lord Privy Seal, Harry Crookshank. Cabinet debated the matter that day and the next, before postponing a final decision. On 27 July 1954, the Lord President of the Council, the Marquess of Salisbury, raised the matter, although it was not on the agenda, stressing the need for a decision. This time Cabinet agreed to proceed with the development of thermonuclear weapons.&#91;86&#93;
Churchill's return to the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's return to the post of Paymaster General. He was a strong supporter of the atomic energy programme,&#91;87&#93; but while he agreed with its size and scope, he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil Service pay and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure was absurdly slow.&#91;88&#93; Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared to those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton.&#91;89&#93; Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.&#91;88&#93;
Cherwell managed to persuade Churchill to propose to Cabinet that a small committee be established to examine the matter. Cabinet agreed at a meeting in November 1952, and the committee was created, chaired by Crookshank.&#91;90&#93; Cabinet accepted its recommendations in April 1953, and another committee was established under Anderson (now Lord Waverley) to make recommendations on the implementation of the new organisation and its structure. The Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 created the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) on 19 July 1954.&#91;91&#93; Plowden became its first chairman.&#91;92&#93; His fellow board members were Hinton, who was in charge of the Industrial Group at Risley; Cockcroft, who headed the Research Group at Harwell; and Penney, who led the Weapons Group at Aldermaston.&#91;93&#93;  The UKAEA initially reported to Salisbury in his capacity as Lord President of the Council;&#91;91&#93; later in the decade the UKAEA would report directly to the Prime Minister.&#91;92&#93; Over 20,000 staff transferred to the UKAEA; by the end of the decade, their numbers had grown to nearly 41,000.&#91;93&#93;
Like Hinton, Penney had difficulty recruiting and retaining the highly skilled staff he needed. In particular, he wanted a deputy with a strong scientific background. An approach to Vivian Bowden failed. After Penney repeatedly asked for William Cook,&#91;94&#93; Salisbury managed to persuade McGrigor to release Cook from the Admiralty to be Penney's deputy.&#91;95&#93; Cook commenced work at Aldermaston on 1 September 1954.&#91;94&#93; Henry Hulme joined in 1954.&#91;96&#93; He was too senior to be placed in Corner's theoretical physics division, so he became an assistant to Penney, with special responsibility for the hydrogen bomb programme. Samuel Curran, who had worked on the Manhattan Project in Berkeley, became head of the radiation measurements division. The physicist John Ward was also recruited at this time.&#91;94&#93;
British knowledge of thermonuclear weapons was based on work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference there on the Super (as it was then called) in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946.&#91;97&#93; The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable.&#91;98&#93; There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi.&#91;77&#93; Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston: Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design similar to the Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design.&#91;99&#93; Orange Herald would be the first British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.&#91;100&#93;
For Green Granite, Penney proposed a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, which he called Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission device. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo.&#91;99&#93; Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, but there was an incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.&#91;101&#93;
Additional information came from the study of Joe 19. It was found that there was a large amount of residual uranium-233. The Soviet scientists had used this isotope so they could distinguish the behaviour of uranium in different parts of the system. This clarified that it was a two-stage device. Hulme prepared a paper in January 1956. At this point there were still three stages, Dick being a fission device and Harry the thermonuclear component. Two weeks later, Ken Allen produced a paper in which he described the mechanism of thermonuclear burning. He suggested that the Americans had compressed lithium-6 and uranium around a fissile core. In April 1956, the recognisable ancestor of the later devices appeared. There were now only two stages: Tom, the fission primary; and Dick, which was now also a set of concentric spheres, with uranium-235 and lithium-6 deuteride shells.&#91;101&#93; A spherical Dick was chosen in preference to a cylindrical one for ease of calculation; work on a cylindrical Dick was postponed until a new IBM 704 computer arrived from the United States.&#91;102&#93;
The Orange Herald boosted core design was a set of concentric spheres. Tritium and deuterium gas (green) was placed inside the uranium-235 core (dark blue), which was enclosed by a uranium-238 tamper. Explosives (orange) imploded it.
In the Green Bamboo boosted core design, solid lithium-6 deuteride (green) was placed between the uranium-235 core (dark blue) and a uranium-238 tamper. There were multiple layers of these.  Explosives (orange) imploded it.
In the Green Granite design, the secondary (Dick) is also a set of concentric spheres. The lithium-6 deuteride (green) was placed around the uranium-235 core (dark blue) which was enclosed by a uranium-235 tamper. The design used in the Grapple 1 and 3 tests had fourteen layers; the one used in Grapple X had just three. It was imploded by the fission Tom.
Implicit in the creation of a hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested. Eden, who replaced Churchill as prime minister after the latter's retirement,&#91;103&#93; gave a radio broadcast in which he declared: "You cannot prove a bomb until it has exploded. Nobody can know whether it is effective or not until it has been tested."&#91;104&#93;
Testing of boosted designs was carried out by Operation Mosaic in the Monte Bello Islands in Western Australia in May and June 1956.&#91;105&#93; This was a sensitive matter; there was an agreement with Australia that no thermonuclear testing would be carried out there.&#91;106&#93; The Australian Minister for Supply Howard Beale, responding to rumours reported in the newspapers,&#91;107&#93; asserted that "the Federal Government has no intention of allowing any, hydrogen bomb tests to take place in Australia. Nor has it any intention of allowing any experiments connected with hydrogen bomb tests to take place here."&#91;108&#93;  Since the tests were connected with hydrogen bomb development, this prompted Eden to cable the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, detailing the nature and purpose of the tests. He promised that the yield of the second, larger test would not be more than two and a half times that of the Operation Hurricane test,&#91;106&#93; which was 25 kilotonnes of TNT (100 ;TJ). Menzies cabled his approval of the tests on 20 June 1955.&#91;109&#93; The yield of the second test turned out to be 60 kilotonnes of TNT (250 ;TJ),&#91;105&#93;&#91;110&#93; which was larger than the limit of 50 kilotonnes of TNT (210 ;TJ) for tests in Australia.&#91;111&#93;
Another test site was therefore required. For safety and security reasons, in light of the Lucky Dragon incident, a large site remote from population centres was required. Various remote islands in the South Pacific and Southern Oceans were considered, along with Antarctica. The Admiralty suggested the Antipodes Islands,&#91;112&#93; which are about 860 kilometres (530 ;mi) southeast of New Zealand.&#91;113&#93; In May 1955, the Minister for Defence, Selwyn Lloyd, concluded that the Kermadec Islands,&#91;112&#93; which lie about 1,000 kilometres (620 ;mi) northeast of New Zealand, would be suitable. They were part of New Zealand,&#91;114&#93; so Eden wrote to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sidney Holland, to ask for permission to use the islands. Holland refused, fearing an adverse public reaction in forthcoming elections. Despite reassurances and pressure from the British government, Holland remained firm. The search for a location continued, with Malden Island and McKean Island being considered.&#91;112&#93; The former became the frontrunner. Three Avro Shackletons from No. 240 Squadron RAF were sent to conduct an aerial reconnaissance and Holland agreed to send the survey ship HMNZS ;Lachlan to conduct a maritime survey.&#91;115&#93;
The test series was given the secret codename "Operation Grapple". Air Commodore Wilfrid Oulton was appointed task force commander,&#91;116&#93; with the acting rank of air vice marshal from 1 March 1956.&#91;117&#93; He had a formidable task ahead of him. Nearby Christmas Island was chosen as a base. It was claimed by both Britain and the United States, but the Americans were willing to let the British use it for the tests.&#91;116&#93; With pressure mounting at home and abroad for a moratorium on testing,&#91;118&#93; 1 April 1957 was set as the target date.&#91;119&#93; Oulton held the first meeting of the Grapple Executive Committee on New Oxford Street in London on 21 February 1956.&#91;120&#93; The RAF and Royal Engineers would improve the airfield to enable it to operate large, heavily loaded aircraft, and the port and facilities would be improved to enable Christmas Island to operate as a base by 1 December 1956. It was estimated that 18,640 measurement tons (21,110 ;m3) of stores would be required for the construction effort alone.&#91;121&#93; The tank landing ship  HMS Narvik would reprise the role of control ship it had for Operation Hurricane; but as it was also required for Operation Mosaic, it had very little time to return to the Chatham Dockyard for a refit before heading out to Christmas Island for Operation Grapple.&#91;119&#93;
Having decided on a location and date, there still remained the matter of what would be tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group would have to produce the assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. The designs were frozen in July. Green Bamboo was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with the design continued. On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would have cost another £1.5 ;million.&#91;122&#93;
The first test of the series was Grapple 1, of Short Granite. This bomb was dropped from a height of 14,000 metres (45,000 ;ft) by a Vickers Valiant bomber of No. 49 Squadron RAF piloted by Wing Commander Kenneth Hubbard, off the shore of Malden Island at 11:38 local time on 15 May 1957.&#91;123&#93; It was Britain's second airdrop of a nuclear bomb after the Operation Buffalo test at Maralinga on 11 October 1956, and the first of a thermonuclear weapon.&#91;124&#93; The United States had not attempted an airdrop of a hydrogen bomb until the Operation Redwing Cherokee test on 21 May 1956. Their bomb had landed 6.4 kilometres (4 ;mi) from the target;&#91;125&#93; Hubbard missed by just 382 metres (418 ;yd). The Short Granite's yield was estimated at 300 kilotonnes of TNT (1,300 ;TJ), far below its designed capability. Penney cancelled the Green Granite test and substituted a new weapon codenamed Purple Granite. This was identical to Short Granite, but with some minor modification to it; additional uranium-235 was added, and the outer layer was replaced with aluminium.&#91;126&#93; Despite its failure, the test was described as a successful thermonuclear explosion, and the government did not confirm or deny reports that the UK had become a third thermonuclear power.&#91;127&#93; When documents on the series were declassified in the 1990s, the tests were denounced as a hoax,&#91;128&#93; but the reports were unlikely to have fooled the American observers.&#91;129&#93;
The next test was Grapple 2, of Orange Herald (small). This bomb was dropped at 10:44 local time on 31 May by another 49 Squadron Valiant, piloted by Squadron Leader Dave Roberts.&#91;130&#93; It exploded with a force of 720 to 800 kilotonnes of TNT (3,000 to 3,300 ;TJ). The yield was the largest ever achieved by a single stage device,&#91;131&#93; and made it technically a megaton weapon, but it was close to Corner's estimate for an unboosted yield, and Hulme doubted that the lithium-6 deuteride had contributed at all.&#91;132&#93; This was chalked up to Taylor instability, which limited the compression of the light elements in the core.&#91;131&#93; The bomb was hailed as a hydrogen bomb, and the truth that it was actually a large fission bomb was kept secret by the British government until the end of the Cold War.&#91;133&#93;&#91;134&#93;
An Operational Requirement (OR1142) had been issued in 1955 for a thermonuclear warhead for a medium-range ballistic missile, which became Blue Streak. This was revised in November 1955, with "megaton" replacing "thermonuclear". Orange Herald (small) could then meet the requirement.&#91;135&#93; A version was created as an interim megaton weapon in order to provide the RAF with one at the earliest possible date.&#91;136&#93; Codenamed Green Grass, the unsuccessful fusion boosting was omitted, and it used Green Bamboo's 72-lens implosion system instead of Orange Herald's 32. This allowed the amount of highly enriched uranium to be reduced from 120 kilograms (260 ;lb) to 75 kilograms (165 ;lb). Its yield was estimated at 0.5 megatonnes of TNT (2.1 ;PJ).&#91;131&#93; It was placed in a Blue Danube casing, and this bomb became known as Violet Club.&#91;137&#93; About ten were delivered before Yellow Sun became available.&#91;136&#93;
The third and final shot of the series was Grapple 3, the test of Purple Granite. This was dropped by a Valiant piloted by Squadron Leader Arthur Steele on 19 June.&#91;138&#93;&#91;130&#93; The yield was a very disappointing 300 kilotonnes of TNT (1,300 ;TJ), even less than Short Granite. The changes had not worked.&#91;132&#93; "We haven't got it right", Cook told a flabbergasted Oulton. "We shall have to do it all again, providing we can do so before the ban comes into force; so that means as soon as possible."&#91;139&#93;
A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of explaining the failure to the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material, that they could not be built to produce yields of more than a megaton, and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister,&#91;140&#93; now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation in the wake of the Suez crisis.&#91;141&#93; The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled, but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.&#91;140&#93;
The scientists at Aldermaston had created a design incorporating staging, radiation implosion, and compression, but they had not mastered the design of thermonuclear weapons. Knowing that much of the yield of American and Soviet bombs came from fission in the uranium-238 tamper, they had focused on what they called the "lithium-uranium cycle", whereby neutrons from the fission of uranium would trigger fusion, which would produce more neutrons to induce fission in the tamper. However, this is not the most important reaction. Corner and his theoretical physicists at Aldermaston argued that Green Granite could be made to work by increasing compression and reducing Taylor instability. The first step would be achieved with an improved Tom. The Red Beard Tom was given an improved high explosive supercharge, a composite (uranium-235 and plutonium) core, and a beryllium tamper, thereby increasing its yield to 45 kilotonnes of TNT (190 ;TJ). The Dick was greatly simplified; instead of the 14 layers in Short Granite, it would have just three.&#91;140&#93;&#91;142&#93; This was called Round A; a five-layer version was also discussed, which was called Round B. A third round, Round C, was produced, for diagnostics. It had the same three layers as Round A, but an inert layer instead of lithium deuteride.  Calculations for Round B were performed on the new IBM 704, while the old Ferranti Mark 1 was used for the simpler Round A.&#91;140&#93;
The next trial was known as Grapple X. To save time and money, and as Narvik and the light aircraft carrier HMS ;Warrior were unavailable,&#91;140&#93; the bomb would be dropped off the southern tip of Christmas Island rather than off Malden Island, just 20 nautical miles (37 ;km; 23 ;mi) from the airfield where 3,000 men would be based.&#91;143&#93; This required a major construction effort to improve the facilities on Christmas Island, and those that had been constructed on Malden Island had to now be duplicated on Christmas Island.&#91;140&#93; Works included 26 blast-proof shelters, a control room, and tented accommodation.&#91;144&#93; Components of Rounds A and C were delivered to Christmas Island on 24, 27 and 29 October. Round B would not be available; to get the calculations for Round A completed, the IBM 704 had to be turned over to them, and there was no possibility of completing the Round B calculations on the Ferranti. On inspection, a fault was found in the Round A Tom, and the fissile core was replaced with the one from Round C.&#91;145&#93;
Round A was dropped by a Valiant bomber piloted by Squadron Leader Barney Millett at 08:47  on 8 November 1957.&#91;146&#93;&#91;147&#93;  This time the yield of 1.8 megatonnes of TNT (7.5 ;PJ) exceeded expectations; the predicted yield had only been 1 megatonne of TNT (4.2 ;PJ). But it was still below the 2 megatonnes of TNT (8.4 ;PJ) safety limit. This was the real hydrogen bomb Britain wanted, but it used a relatively large quantity of expensive highly enriched uranium. Due to the higher-than-expected yield of the explosion, there was some damage to buildings, the fuel storage tanks, and helicopters on the island.&#91;148&#93;
The physicists at Aldermaston had plenty of ideas about how to follow up Grapple X. Possibilities were discussed in September 1957. One was to tinker with the width of the shells in the Dick to find an optimal configuration. If they were too thick, they would slow the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction; if they were too thin, they would give rise to Taylor instability. Another was to do away with the shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had an idea, which Sam Curran supported, of a three-layer Dick that used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7), but more of it, reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the centre of the core. This proposal was the one adopted in October, and it became known as "Dickens" because it used Ken's Dick. The device would otherwise be similar to Round A, but with a larger radiation case. The safety limit was again set to 2 megatonnes of TNT (8.4 ;PJ). Keith Roberts calculated that the yield could reach 3 megatonnes of TNT (13 ;PJ), and suggested that this could be reduced by modifying the tamper, but Cook opposed this, fearing that it might cause the test to fail. Because of the possibility of a moratorium on testing, plans for the test, codenamed Grapple Y, were restricted to the Prime Minister, who gave verbal approval, and a handful of officials.&#91;149&#93;
Air Vice Marshal John Grandy succeeded Oulton as Task Force commander.&#91;150&#93; The bomb was dropped off Christmas at 10:05 local time on 28 April 1958 by a Valiant piloted by Squadron Leader Bob Bates.&#91;151&#93;&#91;152&#93; It had an explosive yield of about 3 megatonnes of TNT (13 ;PJ), and remains the largest British nuclear weapon ever tested.&#91;152&#93; The design of Grapple Y was successful because much of its yield came from its thermonuclear reaction instead of fission of a heavy uranium-238 tamper, making it a true hydrogen bomb, and because its yield had been closely predicted—indicating that its designers understood what they were doing.&#91;142&#93;&#91;153&#93;
On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower announced a moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November.&#91;154&#93; A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices.&#91;155&#93; The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased atmospheric testing for good.&#91;156&#93;
British timing was good. The Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite, on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the Sputnik crisis, officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend the relationship with Britain that had been damaged by the Suez Crisis.&#91;157&#93; At the suggestion of Harold Caccia, the British Ambassador to the United States, Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources to meet the challenge. To do this, the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear cooperation needed to be relaxed.&#91;158&#93; British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb. The trenchant opposition from the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that had derailed previous attempts was absent.&#91;159&#93; Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and were signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.&#91;160&#93; The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed on 3 July,&#91;161&#93; and was approved by Congress on 30 July.&#91;162&#93; Macmillan called this "the Great Prize".&#91;163&#93;
The Anglo-American Special Relationship proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals; the United States was far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs.&#91;166&#93; The British decided to adapt the Mark 28 as a British weapon as a cheaper alternative to doing their own development, which became Red Snow.&#91;167&#93; Other weapons were supplied through Project E, under which weapons in American custody were supplied for the use of the RAF and British Army.&#91;168&#93;&#91;169&#93; Nuclear material was also acquired from the United States. Under the Mutual Defence Agreement 5.4 ;tonnes of UK-produced plutonium was sent to the US in return for 6.7 kilograms (15 ;lb) of tritium and 7.5 ;tonnes of highly enriched uranium between 1960 and 1979, replacing Capenhurst production, although much of the highly enriched uranium was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing UK fleet of nuclear submarines.&#91;170&#93; The British ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the UK Polaris programme and Trident nuclear programme using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.&#91;171&#93;

The San Francisco Bay Salt Ponds are an approximately 16,500-acre (6,700 ;ha) part of the San Francisco Bay that have been used as salt evaporation ponds since the California Gold Rush era. Most of the ponds were once wetlands in the cities of Redwood City, Newark, Hayward and other parts of the bay.
Salt production goes back to when the Ohlone were the only people in the area. After the large influx of people to the area in the 1850s, industrial production began. At first, production was predominantly small family operations, but over time these were replaced by companies like the Oliver Salt Company in Mount Eden and Leslie Salt in Newark. Eventually, Cargill bought out the companies to become the dominant producer in the area. Since 2003, there has been a move to close the ponds and return the area to its natural state. This process may take as long as thirty years.
On the West Coast, the San Francisco Bay is one of two areas with the natural conditions from the sun and wind needed to allow for salt extraction from sea salt to be a commercially viable operation.&#91;1&#93; 
The ponds are noted for their vivid colors, ranging from magenta to blue-green, that are especially visible from the air. The colors come from the brine shrimp and microorganisms that thrive in the different salinity levels in the ponds. In particular, synechococcus, halobacteria, and dunaliella affect the color of salt ponds.&#91;2&#93;
At the time of the Gold Rush, salt was an important part of food preservation and was used in many industries. The favorable conditions and the immediate need sparked the explosion in salt production.&#91;3&#93;
At the time, the marshlands were seen as unproductive land that could be developed for better uses. Eventually this led to 80% of the original marshes developed for other uses.&#91;3&#93; Over time, many of the smaller producers sold their land and producing rights to the Oliver Salt Company,&#91;4&#93; which would eventually replace the Leslie Salt Company in Newark. In 1972, Cargill purchased Leslie to become the dominant landholder and holder of salt production rights in the area.&#91;5&#93;
In 2003, Cargill sold the bulk of its salt ponds to the California Coastal Conservancy, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and private foundations with the goal of restoring the ponds to wetlands. This effort is known as the "South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project".&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;
Not all the salt ponds are being restored. Cargill has proposed development of the ponds into housing in Redwood City.&#91;8&#93;
The project is being headed by the state of California and the federal government to restore 15,100 acres (61 ;km2) of Cargill's former salt ponds in San Francisco Bay.&#91;9&#93; In October 2000, Cargill proposed to consolidate its operations and sell lands and salt production rights on 61% of its South Bay Operation area. Negotiations were headed by Senator Dianne Feinstein and a framework agreement was signed in May 2002 by the conservancy, the California Resources Agency, the Wildlife Conservation Board, the California Department of Fish and Game, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Cargill and Senator Feinstein.&#91;9&#93; California approved purchase of the property on February 11, 2003. The land is currently managed and owned by the US Fish and Wildlife Services and the Department of Fish and Game.&#91;9&#93; The goal of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project is to restore 90% of the former salt ponds to natural wetlands. The Native Plant Nursery at Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is providing plants to the restoration project. The SBSPRP, with over 15,000 acres and a 50-year plan, is the largest wetlands restoration project on the West Coast and provides the benefits of wetland restoration, including flood control, pollution reduction, habitat expansion for wildlife, and public access and recreation for people.&#91;10&#93;
The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project is integrating restoration with flood management, while also providing for public access and wildlife-oriented recreation and education opportunities.&#91;9&#93; Restored tidal marshes will provide critical habitat for the endangered California clapper rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse. Large marsh areas will also provide extensive channel systems which will provide habitat for aquatic life and harbor seals.&#91;9&#93; Flood management will also be integrated to protect local communities. Restoration will also offer many opportunities for public use, including trails for hiking and biking, hunting, bird watching, environmental education and other recreational opportunities.&#91;9&#93;
Eden Landing Ecological Reserve is part of the area being restored. The Hewlett Foundation has funded restoration of the Bay Area Salt Ponds.&#91;11&#93;

Artemia is a genus of aquatic crustaceans also known as brine shrimp. Artemia, the only genus in the family Artemiidae, has changed little externally since the Triassic period. The first historical record of the existence of Artemia dates back to the first half of the 10th century AD from Urmia Lake, Iran, with an example called by an Iranian geographer an "aquatic dog",&#91;2&#93; although the first unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schlösser in 1757 of animals from Lymington, England.&#91;3&#93; Artemia populations are found worldwide in inland saltwater lakes, but not in oceans. Artemia are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators, such as fish, by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity (up to 25%).&#91;4&#93;
The ability of the Artemia to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts, has led to extensive use of Artemia in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored indefinitely and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval fish and crustaceans.&#91;4&#93; Nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia constitute the most widely used food item, and over 2000 tonnes of dry Artemia cysts are marketed worldwide annually. In addition, the resilience of Artemia makes them ideal animals running biological toxicity assays and it has become a model organism used to test the toxicity of chemicals. Breeds of Artemia are sold as novelty gifts under the marketing name Sea-Monkeys or Aqua Dragons.&#91;5&#93;
The brine shrimp Artemia comprises a group of seven to nine species very likely to have diverged from an ancestral form living in the Mediterranean area about 5.5 ;million years ago,&#91;6&#93; around the time of the Messinian salinity crisis.
The Laboratory of Aquaculture &amp; Artemia Reference Center (ARC) at Ghent University possesses the largest known Artemia cyst collection, a cyst bank containing over 1,700 Artemia population samples collected from different locations around the world.&#91;7&#93;
Artemia is a typical primitive arthropod with a segmented body to which is attached broad leaf-like appendages. The body usually consists of 19 segments, the first 11 of which have pairs of appendages, the next two which are often fused together carry the reproductive organs, and the last segments lead to the tail.&#91;8&#93; The total length is usually about 8–10 millimetres (0.31–0.39 ;in) for the adult male and 10–12 ;mm (0.39–0.47 ;in) for the female, but the width of both sexes, including the legs, is about 4 ;mm (0.16 ;in).
The body of Artemia is divided into head, thorax, and abdomen. The entire body is covered with a thin, flexible exoskeleton of chitin to which muscles are attached internally and which is shed periodically.&#91;9&#93; In female Artemia, a moult precedes every ovulation.
For brine shrimp, many functions, including swimming, digestion and reproduction are not controlled through the brain; instead, local nervous system ganglia may control some regulation or synchronisation of these functions.&#91;9&#93; Autotomy, the voluntary shedding or dropping of parts of the body for defence, is also controlled locally along the nervous system.&#91;8&#93; Artemia have two types of eyes. They have two widely separated compound eyes mounted on flexible stalks. These compound eyes are the main optical sense organ in adult brine shrimps. The median eye, or the naupliar eye, is situated anteriorly in the centre of the head and is the only functional optical sense organ in the nauplii, which is functional until the adult stage.&#91;9&#93;
Brine shrimp can tolerate any levels of salinity from 25‰ to 250‰ (25–250 ;g/L),&#91;10&#93; with an optimal range of 60‰–100‰,&#91;10&#93; and occupy the ecological niche that can protect them from predators.&#91;11&#93; Physiologically, optimal levels of salinity are about 30–35‰, but due to predators at these salt levels, brine shrimp seldom occur in natural habitats at salinities of less than 60–80‰. Locomotion is achieved by the rhythmic beating of the appendages acting in pairs. Respiration occurs on the surface of the legs through fibrous, feather-like plates (lamellar epipodites)&#91;8&#93;
Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilisation. Thelytoky is a particular form of parthenogenesis in which the development of a female individual occurs from an unfertilised egg. Automixis is a form of thelytoky, but there are different kinds of automixis. The kind of automixis relevant here is one in which two haploid products from the same meiosis combine to form a diploid zygote.
Diploid Artemia parthenogenetica reproduce by automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion (see diagram) and low but nonzero recombination.&#91;13&#93; Central fusion of two of the haploid products of meiosis (see diagram) tends to maintain heterozygosity in transmission of the genome from mother to offspring, and to minimise inbreeding depression. Low crossover recombination during meiosis likely restrains the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity over successive generations.
In their first stage of development, Artemia do not feed but consume their own energy reserves stored in the cyst.&#91;14&#93; Wild brine shrimp eat microscopic planktonic algae. Cultured brine shrimp can also be fed particulate foods including yeast, wheat flour, soybean powder or egg yolk.&#91;15&#93;
Artemia comprises sexually reproducing, diploid species and several obligate parthenogenetic Artemia populations consisting of different clones and ploidies (2n-&gt;5n).&#91;16&#93;
Fish farm owners search for a cost-effective, easy to use, and available food that is preferred by the fish. From cysts, brine shrimp nauplii can readily be used to feed fish and crustacean larvae just after one-day incubation. Instar I (the nauplii that just hatched and with large yolk reserves in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, because they are easy for operation, rich in nutrients, and small, which makes them suitable for feeding fish and crustacean larvae live or after drying.
Artemia found favor as a model organism for use in toxicological assays, despite the recognition that it is too robust an organism to be a sensitive indicator species.&#91;17&#93;
In pollution research Artemia, the brine shrimp, has had extensive use as a test organism and in some circumstances is an acceptable alternative to the toxicity testing of mammals in the laboratory.&#91;18&#93; The fact that millions of brine shrimp are so easily reared has been an important help in assessing the effects of a large number of environmental pollutants on the shrimps under well controlled experimental conditions.
Overall brine shrimp are abundant, but some populations and localized species do face threats, especially from habitat loss to introduced species. For example, A. franciscana of the Americas has been widely introduced to places outside its native range and is often able to outcompete local species, such as A. salina in the Mediterranean region.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93;
Among the highly localized species are A. urmiana from Lake Urmia in Iran. Once abundant, the species has drastically declined due to drought, leading to fears that it was almost extinct.&#91;21&#93; However, a second population of this species has recently been discovered in the Koyashskoye Salt Lake at the Crimean Peninsula.&#91;22&#93;
A. monica, the species commonly known as Mono Lake brine shrimp, can be found in Mono Lake, Mono County, California. In 1987, Dennis D. Murphy from Stanford University petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to add A. monica to the endangered species list under the Endangered Species Act (1973). The diversion of water by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power resulted in rising salinity and concentration of sodium hydroxide in Mono Lake. Despite the presence of trillions of brine shrimp in the lake, the petition contended that the increase in pH would endanger them. The threat to the lake's water levels was addressed by a revision to California State Water Resources Control Board's policy, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service found on 7 September 1995 that the Mono Lake brine shrimp did not warrant listing.&#91;23&#93;
Scientists have taken the eggs of brine shrimp to outer space to test the impact of radiation on life. Brine shrimp cysts were flown on the U.S. Biosatellite II, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17 missions, and on the Russian Bion-3 (Cosmos 782), Bion-5 (Cosmos 1129), Foton 10, and Foton 11 flights. Some of the Russian flights carried European Space Agency experiments.
On Apollo 16 and Apollo 17, the cysts traveled to the Moon and back. Cosmic rays that passed through an egg would be detected on the photographic film in its container. Some eggs were kept on Earth as experimental controls as part of the tests. Also, as the take-off in a spacecraft involves a lot of shaking and acceleration, one control group of egg cysts was accelerated to seven times the force of gravity and vibrated mechanically from side to side for several minutes so that they could experience the same violence of a rocket take-off.&#91;24&#93; There were 400 eggs in each experimental group. All the egg cysts from the experiment were then placed in salt water to hatch under optimum conditions. The results showed Artemia salina eggs are highly sensitive to cosmic radiation; 90% of the embryo induced to develop from hit eggs died at different developmental stages.&#91;25&#93;

The Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries was the largest contiguous land empire and second-largest empire in history, behind only the British Empire.&#91;2&#93; Originating in Mongolia, the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe to the Sea of Japan, extending northward into parts of the Arctic;&#91;3&#93; eastward and southward into the Indian subcontinent, Mainland Southeast Asia and the Iranian Plateau; and westward as far as the Levant and the Carpathian Mountains.
The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of several nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan (c.&#8201; 1162–1227), whom a council proclaimed as the ruler of all Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent out invading armies in every direction.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; The vast transcontinental empire connected the East with the West, the Pacific to the Mediterranean, in an enforced Pax Mongolica, allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade, technologies, commodities and ideologies across Eurasia.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;
The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir Ögedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi. The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of Ögedeid and Chagatai factions, but disputes continued among the descendants of Tolui. A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire, or would stay true to the Mongol nomadic and steppe-based lifestyle. After Möngke Khan died (1259), rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq Böke and Kublai Khan, who fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (1260–1264) and also dealt with challenges from the descendants of other sons of Genghis.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93; Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as he sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and Ögedeid families.
During the reigns of Genghis and Ögedei, the Mongols suffered the occasional defeat when a less skilled general received the command. The Siberian Tumeds defeated the Mongol forces under Borokhula around 1215–1217; Jalal al-Din defeated Shigi-Qutugu at the Battle of Parwan in 1221; and the Jin generals Heda and Pu'a defeated Dolqolqu in 1230. In each case, the Mongols returned shortly after with a much larger army led by one of their best generals, and were invariably victorious. The Battle of Ain Jalut in Galilee in 1260 marked the first time that the Mongols would not return to immediately avenge a defeat, due to a combination of the death of Möngke Khan in 1259, the Toluid Civil War between Ariq Böke and Kublai Khan, and Berke Khan of the Golden Horde attacking Hulegu in Persia. Although the Mongols launched many more invasions of the Levant, briefly occupying it and raiding as far as Gaza after a decisive victory at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar in 1299, they withdrew due to various geopolitical factors.
By the time of Kublai's death in 1294 the Mongol Empire had fractured into four separate khanates or empires, each pursuing its own separate interests and objectives: the Golden Horde khanate in the northwest, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the Ilkhanate in the southwest, and the Yuan dynasty in the east, based in modern-day Beijing.&#91;10&#93;
What is referred to in English as the Mongol Empire was called the  Ikh Mongol Uls (ikh: "great", uls: "state"; Great Mongolian State).&#91;13&#93; In the 1240s, one of Genghis's descendants, Güyük Khan, wrote a letter to Pope Innocent IV which used the preamble "Dalai (great/oceanic) Khagan of the great Mongolian state (ulus)".&#91;14&#93;
After the succession war between Kublai Khan and his brother Ariq Böke, Ariq limited Kublai's power to the eastern part of the empire. Kublai officially issued an imperial edict on 18 December 1271 to name the country Great Yuan (Dai Yuan, or Dai Ön Ulus) to establish the Yuan dynasty. Some sources state that the full Mongolian name was Dai Ön Yehe Monggul Ulus.&#91;15&#93;
The area around Mongolia, Manchuria, and parts of North China had been controlled by the Liao dynasty since the 10th century. In 1125, the Jin dynasty founded by the Jurchens overthrew the Liao dynasty and attempted to gain control over former Liao territory in Mongolia. In the 1130s the Jin dynasty rulers, known as the Golden Kings, successfully resisted the Khamag Mongol confederation, ruled at the time by Khabul Khan, great-grandfather of Genghis Khan.&#91;16&#93;
The Mongolian plateau was occupied mainly by five powerful tribal confederations (khanlig): Keraites, Khamag Mongol, Naiman, Mergid, and Tatar. The Jin emperors, following a policy of divide and rule, encouraged disputes among the tribes, especially between the Tatars and the Mongols, in order to keep the nomadic tribes distracted by their own battles and thereby away from the Jin. Khabul's successor was Ambaghai Khan, who was betrayed by the Tatars, handed over to the Jurchen, and executed. The Mongols retaliated by raiding the frontier, resulting in a failed Jurchen counter-attack in 1143.&#91;16&#93;
In 1147, the Jin somewhat changed their policy, signing a peace treaty with the Mongols and withdrawing from a score of forts. The Mongols then resumed attacks on the Tatars to avenge the death of their late khan, opening a long period of active hostilities. The Jin and Tatar armies defeated the Mongols in 1161.&#91;16&#93;
During the rise of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the usually cold, parched steppes of Central Asia enjoyed their mildest, wettest conditions in more than a millennium. It is thought that this resulted in a rapid increase in the number of war horses and other livestock, which significantly enhanced Mongol military strength.&#91;17&#93;
Known during his childhood as Temüjin, Genghis Khan was a son of a Mongol chieftain. As a young man he rose very rapidly by working with Toghrul Khan of the Kerait. The most powerful Mongol leader at the time was Kurtait; he was given the Chinese title "Wang", which means King.&#91;18&#93; Temujin went to war with Wang Khan. After Temujin defeated Wang Khan he gave himself the name Genghis Khan. He then enlarged his Mongol state under himself and his kin. The term Mongol came to be used to refer to all Mongolic speaking tribes under the control of Genghis Khan. His most powerful allies were his father's friend, Khereid chieftain Wang Khan Toghoril, and Temujin's childhood anda (blood brother) Jamukha of the Jadran clan. With their help, Temujin defeated the Merkit tribe, rescued his wife Börte, and went on to defeat the Naimans and the Tatars.&#91;19&#93;
Temujin forbade looting of his enemies without permission, and he implemented a policy of sharing spoils with his warriors and their families instead of giving it all to the aristocrats.&#91;20&#93; These policies brought him into conflict with his uncles, who were also legitimate heirs to the throne; they regarded Temujin not as a leader but as an insolent usurper. This dissatisfaction spread to his generals and other associates, and some Mongols who had previously been allies broke their allegiance.&#91;19&#93; War ensued, and Temujin and the forces still loyal to him prevailed, defeating the remaining rival tribes between 1203 and 1205 and bringing them under his sway. In 1206, Temujin was crowned as the khagan (Emperor) of the Yekhe Mongol Ulus (Great Mongol State) at a Kurultai (general assembly/council). It was there that he assumed the title of Genghis Khan (universal leader) instead of one of the old tribal titles such as Gur Khan or Tayang Khan, marking the start of the Mongol Empire.&#91;19&#93;
Genghis Khan introduced many innovative ways of organizing his army: for example dividing it into decimal subsections of arbans (10 soldiers), zuuns (100), Mingghans (1000), and tumens (10,000). The Kheshig, the imperial guard, was founded and divided into day (khorchin torghuds) and night (khevtuul) guards.&#91;21&#93; Genghis rewarded those who had been loyal to him and placed them in high positions, as heads of army units and households, even though many of them came from very low-ranking clans.&#91;22&#93;
Compared to the units he gave to his loyal companions, those assigned to his own family members were relatively few. He proclaimed a new code of law of the empire, Ikh Zasag or Yassa; later he expanded it to cover much of the everyday life and political affairs of the nomads. He forbade the selling of women, theft, fighting among the Mongols, and the hunting of animals during the breeding season.&#91;22&#93;
He appointed his adopted brother Shigi-Khuthugh as supreme judge (jarughachi), ordering him to keep records of the empire. In addition to laws regarding family, food, and the army, Genghis also decreed religious freedom and supported domestic and international trade. He exempted the poor and the clergy from taxation.&#91;23&#93; He also encouraged literacy, adopting the Uyghur script, which would form the Uyghur-Mongolian script of the empire, and he ordered the Uyghur Tatatunga, who had previously served the khan of Naimans, to instruct his sons.&#91;24&#93;
Genghis quickly came into conflict with the Jin dynasty of the Jurchens and the Western Xia of the Tanguts in northern China. He also had to deal with two other powers, Tibet and Qara Khitai.&#91;25&#93; Then, he moved towards the west, gaining claim to parts of Russia, Ukraine, and whole countries in Central Asia, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and other countries.
Before his death, Genghis Khan divided his empire among his sons and immediate family, making the Mongol Empire the joint property of the entire imperial family who, along with the Mongol aristocracy, constituted the ruling class.&#91;26&#93;
Prior to the three western khanates' adoption of Islam, Genghis Khan and a number of his Yuan successors placed restrictions on religious practices they saw as alien. Muslims, including Hui, and Jews, were collectively referred to as Huihui. Muslims were forbidden from Halal or Zabiha butchering, while Jews were similarly forbidden from Kashrut or Shehita butchering.&#91;27&#93; Referring to the conquered subjects as "our slaves," Genghis Khan demanded they no longer be able to refuse food or drink, and imposed restrictions on slaughter. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret.&#91;28&#93;
Genghis Khan arranged for the Chinese Taoist master Qiu Chuji to visit him in Afghanistan, and also gave his subjects the right to religious freedom, despite his own shamanistic beliefs.
Genghis Khan died on 18 August 1227, by which time the Mongol Empire ruled from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea, an empire twice the size of the Roman Empire or the Muslim Caliphate at their height.&#91;citation needed&#93; Genghis named his third son, the charismatic Ögedei, as his heir. According to Mongol tradition, Genghis Khan was buried in a secret location. The regency was originally held by Ögedei's younger brother Tolui until Ögedei's formal election at the kurultai in 1229.&#91;30&#93;
Among his first actions Ögedei sent troops to subjugate the Bashkirs, Bulgars, and other nations in the Kipchak-controlled steppes.&#91;31&#93; In the east, Ögedei's armies re-established Mongol authority in Manchuria, crushing the Eastern Xia regime and the Water Tatars. In 1230, the great khan personally led his army in the campaign against the Jin dynasty of China. Ögedei's general Subutai captured the capital of Emperor Wanyan Shouxu in the siege of Kaifeng in 1232.&#91;32&#93; The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234 when the Mongols captured Caizhou, the town to which Wanyan Shouxu had fled. In 1234, three armies commanded by Ögedei's sons Kochu and Koten and the Tangut general Chagan invaded southern China. With the assistance of the Song dynasty the Mongols finished off the Jin in 1234.&#91;33&#93;&#91;34&#93;
Many Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin. Two Han Chinese leaders, Shi Tianze, Liu Heima (劉黑馬, Liu Ni),&#91;35&#93; and the Khitan Xiao Zhala defected and commanded the 3 Tumens in the Mongol army.&#91;36&#93; Liu Heima and Shi Tianze served Ogödei Khan.&#91;37&#93; Liu Heima and Shi Tianxiang led armies against Western Xia for the Mongols.&#91;38&#93; There were four Han Tumens and three Khitan Tumens, with each Tumen consisting of 10,000 troops. The Yuan dynasty created a Han army 漢軍 from Jin defectors, and another of ex-Song troops called the Newly Submitted Army 新附軍.&#91;39&#93;
In the West Ögedei's general Chormaqan destroyed Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, the last shah of the Khwarizmian Empire. The small kingdoms in southern Persia voluntarily accepted Mongol supremacy.&#91;40&#93;&#91;41&#93; In East Asia, there were a number of Mongolian campaigns into Goryeo Korea, but Ögedei's attempt to annex the Korean Peninsula met with little success. Gojong, the king of Goryeo, surrendered but later revolted and massacred Mongol darughachis (overseers); he then moved his imperial court from Gaeseong to Ganghwa Island.&#91;42&#93;
Meanwhile, in an offensive action against the Song dynasty, Mongol armies captured Siyang-yang, the Yangtze and Sichuan, but did not secure their control over the conquered areas. The Song generals were able to recapture Siyang-yang from the Mongols in 1239. After the sudden death of Ögedei's son Kochu in Chinese territory the Mongols withdrew from southern China, although Kochu's brother Prince Koten invaded Tibet immediately after their withdrawal.&#91;19&#93;
Batu Khan, another grandson of Genghis Khan, overran the territories of the Bulgars, the Alans, the Kypchaks, Bashkirs, Mordvins, Chuvash, and other nations of the southern Russian steppe. By 1237 the Mongols were encroaching upon Ryazan, the first Kievan Rus' principality they were to attack. After a three-day siege involving fierce fighting, the Mongols captured the city and massacred its inhabitants. They then proceeded to destroy the army of the Grand Principality of Vladimir at the Battle of the Sit River.&#91;43&#93;
The Mongols captured the Alania capital Maghas in 1238. By 1240, all Kievan Rus' had fallen to the Asian invaders except for a few northern cities. Mongol troops under Chormaqan in Persia connecting his invasion of Transcaucasia with the invasion of Batu and Subutai, forced the Georgian and Armenian nobles to surrender as well.&#91;43&#93;
Giovanni de Plano Carpini, the pope's envoy to the Mongol great khan, travelled through Kiev in February 1246 and wrote:
Despite the military successes, strife continued within the Mongol ranks. Batu's relations with Güyük, Ögedei's eldest son, and Büri, the beloved grandson of Chagatai Khan, remained tense and worsened during Batu's victory banquet in southern Kievan Rus'. Nevertheless, Güyük and Buri could not do anything to harm Batu's position as long as his uncle Ögedei was still alive. Ögedei continued with offensives into the Indian subcontinent, temporarily investing Uchch, Lahore, and Multan of the Delhi Sultanate and stationing a Mongol overseer in Kashmir,&#91;45&#93; though the invasions into India eventually failed and were forced to retreat. In northeastern Asia, Ögedei agreed to end the conflict with Goryeo by making it a client state and sent Mongolian princesses to wed Goryeo princes. He then reinforced his kheshig with the Koreans through both diplomacy and military force.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93;
Following the Great Khan Ögedei's death in 1241, and before the next kurultai, Ögedei's widow Töregene took over the empire. She persecuted her husband's Khitan and Muslim officials and gave high positions to her own allies. She built palaces, cathedrals, and social structures on an imperial scale, supporting religion and education.&#91;52&#93; She was able to win over most Mongol aristocrats to support Ögedei's son Güyük. But Batu, ruler of the Golden Horde, refused to come to the kurultai, claiming that he was ill and that the Mongolian climate was too harsh for him. The resulting stalemate lasted more than four years and further destabilized the unity of the empire.&#91;52&#93;
When Genghis Khan's youngest brother Temüge threatened to seize the throne, Güyük came to Karakorum to try to secure his position.&#91;53&#93; Batu eventually agreed to send his brothers and generals to the kurultai convened by Töregene in 1246. Güyük by this time was ill and alcoholic, but his campaigns in Manchuria and Europe gave him the kind of stature necessary for a great khan. He was duly elected at a ceremony attended by Mongols and foreign dignitaries from both within and without the empire ;— leaders of vassal nations, representatives from Rome, and other entities who came to the kurultai to show their respects and conduct diplomacy.&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93;
Güyük took steps to reduce corruption, announcing that he would continue the policies of his father Ögedei, not those of Töregene. He punished Töregene's supporters, except for governor Arghun the Elder. He also replaced young Qara Hülëgü, the khan of the Chagatai Khanate, with his favorite cousin Yesü Möngke, to assert his newly conferred powers.&#91;56&#93; He restored his father's officials to their former positions and was surrounded by Uyghur, Naiman and Central Asian officials, favoring Han Chinese commanders who had helped his father conquer Northern China. He continued military operations in Korea, advanced into Song China in the south, and into Iraq in the west, and ordered an empire-wide census. Güyük also divided the Sultanate of Rum between Izz-ad-Din Kaykawus and Rukn ad-Din Kilij Arslan, though Kaykawus disagreed with this decision.&#91;56&#93;
Not all parts of the empire respected Güyük's election. The Hashshashins, former Mongol allies whose Grand Master Hasan Jalalud-Din had offered his submission to Genghis Khan in 1221, angered Güyük by refusing to submit. Instead he murdered the Mongol generals in Persia. Güyük appointed his best friend's father Eljigidei as chief commander of the troops in Persia and gave them the task of both reducing the strongholds of the Nizari Ismailis and conquering the Abbasids at the center of the Islamic world, Iran and Iraq.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93;
In 1248, Güyük raised more troops and suddenly marched westward from the Mongol capital of Karakorum. The reasoning was unclear. Some sources wrote that he sought to recuperate at his personal estate, Emyl; others suggested that he might have been moving to join Eljigidei to conduct a full-scale conquest of the Middle East, or possibly to make a surprise attack on his rival cousin Batu Khan in Russia.&#91;59&#93;
Suspicious of Güyük's motives, Sorghaghtani Beki, the widow of Genghis's son Tolui, secretly warned her nephew Batu of Güyük's approach. Batu had himself been traveling eastward at the time, possibly to pay homage, or perhaps with other plans in mind. Before the forces of Batu and Güyük met, Güyük, sick and worn out by travel, died en route at Qum-Senggir (Hong-siang-yi-eulh) in Xinjiang, possibly a victim of poison.&#91;59&#93;
Güyük's widow Oghul Qaimish stepped forward to take control of the empire, but she lacked the skills of her mother-in-law Töregene, and her young sons Khoja and Naku and other princes challenged her authority. To decide on a new great khan, Batu called a kurultai on his own territory in 1250. As it was far from the Mongolian heartland, members of the Ögedeid and Chagataid families refused to attend. The kurultai offered the throne to Batu, but he rejected it, claiming he had no interest in the position.&#91;60&#93; Batu instead nominated Möngke, a grandson of Genghis from his son Tolui's lineage. Möngke was leading a Mongol army in Russia, the northern Caucasus and Hungary. The pro-Tolui faction supported Batu's choice, and Möngke was elected; though given the kurultai's limited attendance and location, it was of questionable validity.&#91;60&#93;
Batu sent Möngke, under the protection of his brothers, Berke and Tukhtemur, and his son Sartaq to assemble a more formal kurultai at Kodoe Aral in the heartland. The supporters of Möngke repeatedly invited Oghul Qaimish and the other major Ögedeid and Chagataid princes to attend the kurultai, but they refused each time. The Ögedeid and Chagataid princes refused to accept a descendant of Genghis's son Tolui as leader, demanding that only descendants of Genghis's son Ögedei could be great khan.&#91;60&#93;
When Möngke's mother Sorghaghtani and their cousin Berke organized a second kurultai on 1 July 1251, the assembled throng proclaimed Möngke great khan of the Mongol Empire. This marked a major shift in the leadership of the empire, transferring power from the descendants of Genghis's son Ögedei to the descendants of Genghis's son Tolui. The decision was acknowledged by a few of the Ögedeid and Chagataid princes, such as Möngke's cousin Kadan and the deposed khan Qara Hülëgü, but one of the other legitimate heirs, Ögedei's grandson Shiremun, sought to topple Möngke.&#91;61&#93;
Shiremun moved with his own forces toward the emperor's nomadic palace with a plan for an armed attack, but Möngke was alerted by his falconer of the plan. Möngke ordered an investigation of the plot, which led to a series of major trials all across the empire. Many members of the Mongol elite were found guilty and put to death, with estimates ranging from 77–300, though princes of Genghis's royal line were often exiled rather than executed.&#91;61&#93;
Möngke confiscated the estates of the Ögedeid and the Chagatai families and shared the western part of the empire with his ally Batu Khan. After the bloody purge, Möngke ordered a general amnesty for prisoners and captives, but thereafter the power of the great khan's throne remained firmly with the descendants of Tolui.&#91;61&#93;
Möngke was a serious man who followed the laws of his ancestors and avoided alcoholism. He was tolerant of outside religions and artistic styles, leading to the building of foreign merchants' quarters, Buddhist monasteries, mosques, and Christian churches in the Mongol capital. As construction projects continued, Karakorum was adorned with Chinese, European, and Persian architecture. One famous example was a large silver tree with cleverly designed pipes that dispensed various drinks. The tree, topped by a triumphant angel, was crafted by Guillaume Boucher, a Parisian goldsmith.&#91;62&#93;
Although he had a strong Chinese contingent, Möngke relied heavily on Muslim and Mongol administrators and launched a series of economic reforms to make government expenses more predictable. His court limited government spending and prohibited nobles and troops from abusing civilians or issuing edicts without authorization. He commuted the contribution system to a fixed poll tax which was collected by imperial agents and forwarded to units in need.&#91;63&#93; His court also tried to lighten the tax burden on commoners by reducing tax rates. He also centralized control of monetary affairs and reinforced the guards at the postal relays. Möngke ordered an empire-wide census in 1252 that took several years to complete and was not finished until Novgorod in the far northwest was counted in 1258.&#91;63&#93;
In another move to consolidate his power, Möngke assigned his brothers Hulagu and Kublai to rule Persia and Mongol-held China respectively. In the southern part of the empire he continued his predecessors' struggle against the Song dynasty. In order to outflank the Song from three directions, Möngke dispatched Mongol armies under his brother Kublai to Yunnan, and under his uncle Iyeku to subdue Korea and pressure the Song from that direction as well.&#91;56&#93;
Kublai conquered the Dali Kingdom in 1253 after the Dali King Duan Xingzhi defected to the Mongols and helped them conquer the rest of Yunnan. Möngke's general Qoridai stabilized his control over Tibet, inducing leading monasteries to submit to Mongol rule. Subutai's son Uryankhadai reduced the neighboring peoples of Yunnan to submission and went to war with the kingdom of Đại Việt under the Trần dynasty in northern Vietnam in 1258, but they had to draw back.&#91;56&#93; The Mongol Empire tried to invade Đại Việt again in 1285 and 1287 but were defeated both times.
After stabilizing the empire's finances, Möngke once again sought to expand its borders. At kurultais in Karakorum in 1253 and 1258 he approved new invasions of the Middle East and south China. Möngke put Hulagu in overall charge of military and civil affairs in Persia, and appointed Chagataids and Jochids to join Hulagu's army.&#91;64&#93;
The Muslims from Qazvin denounced the menace of the Nizari Ismailis, a well-known sect of Shiites. The Mongol Naiman commander Kitbuqa began to assault several Ismaili fortresses in 1253, before Hulagu advanced in 1256. Ismaili Grand Master Rukn al-Din Khurshah surrendered in 1257 and was executed. All of the Ismaili strongholds in Persia were destroyed by Hulagu's army in 1257, except for Girdkuh which held out until 1271.&#91;64&#93;
The center of the Islamic Empire at the time was Baghdad, which had held power for 500 years but was suffering internal divisions. When its caliph al-Mustasim refused to submit to the Mongols, Baghdad was besieged and captured by the Mongols in 1258 and subjected to a merciless sack, an event considered as one of the most catastrophic events in the history of Islam, and sometimes compared to the rupture of the Kaaba. With the destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate, Hulagu had an open route to Syria and moved against the other Muslim powers in the region.&#91;65&#93;
His army advanced toward Ayyubid-ruled Syria, capturing small local states en route. The sultan Al-Nasir Yusuf of the Ayyubids refused to show himself before Hulagu; however, he had accepted Mongol supremacy two decades earlier. When Hulagu headed further west, the Armenians from Cilicia, the Seljuks from Rum and the Christian realms of Antioch and Tripoli submitted to Mongol authority, joining them in their assault against the Muslims. While some cities surrendered without resisting, others, such as Mayafarriqin fought back; their populations were massacred and the cities were sacked.&#91;65&#93;
Meanwhile, in the northwestern portion of the empire, Batu's successor and younger brother Berke sent punitive expeditions to Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. Dissension began brewing between the northwestern and southwestern sections of the Mongol Empire as Batu suspected that Hulagu's invasion of Western Asia would result in the elimination of Batu's own dominance there.&#91;66&#93;
In the southern part of the empire, Möngke Khan himself led his army did not complete the conquest of China. Military operations were generally successful, but prolonged, so the forces did not withdraw to the north as was customary when the weather turned hot. Disease ravaged the Mongol forces with bloody epidemics, and Möngke died there on 11 August 1259. This event began a new chapter in the history of the Mongols, as again a decision needed to be made on a new great khan. Mongol armies across the empire withdrew from their campaigns to convene a new kurultai.&#91;67&#93;
Möngke's brother Hulagu broke off his successful military advance into Syria, withdrawing the bulk of his forces to Mughan and leaving only a small contingent under his general Kitbuqa. The opposing forces in the region, the Christian Crusaders and Muslim Mamluks, both recognizing that the Mongols were the greater threat, took advantage of the weakened state of the Mongol army and engaged in an unusual passive truce with each other.&#91;68&#93;
In 1260, the Mamluks advanced from Egypt, being allowed to camp and resupply near the Christian stronghold of Acre, and engaged Kitbuqa's forces just north of Galilee at the Battle of Ain Jalut. The Mongols were defeated, and Kitbuqa executed. This pivotal battle marked the western limit for Mongol expansion in the Middle East, and the Mongols were never again able to make serious military advances farther than Syria.&#91;68&#93;
In a separate part of the empire, Kublai Khan, another brother of Hulagu and Möngke, heard of the great khan's death at the Huai River in China. Rather than returning to the capital, he continued his advance into the Wuchang area of China, near the Yangtze River. Their younger brother Ariqboke took advantage of the absence of Hulagu and Kublai, and used his position at the capital to win the title of great khan for himself, with representatives of all the family branches proclaiming him as the leader at the kurultai in Karakorum. When Kublai learned of this, he summoned his own kurultai at Kaiping, and nearly all the senior princes and great noyans in North China and Manchuria supported his own candidacy over that of Ariqboke.&#91;51&#93;
Battles ensued between the armies of Kublai and those of his brother Ariqboke, which included forces still loyal to Möngke's previous administration. Kublai's army easily eliminated Ariqboke's supporters and seized control of the civil administration in southern Mongolia. Further challenges took place from their cousins, the Chagataids.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93; Kublai sent Abishka, a Chagataid prince loyal to him, to take charge of Chagatai's realm. But Ariqboke captured and then executed Abishka, having his own man Alghu crowned there instead. Kublai's new administration blockaded Ariqboke in Mongolia to cut off food supplies, causing a famine. Karakorum fell quickly to Kublai, but Ariqboke rallied and re-took the capital in 1261.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93;
In southwestern Ilkhanate, Hulagu was loyal to his brother Kublai, but clashes with their cousin Berke, the ruler of the Golden Horde, began in 1262. The suspicious deaths of Jochid princes in Hulagu's service, unequal distribution of war booty, and Hulagu's massacres of Muslims increased the anger of Berke, who considered supporting a rebellion of the Georgian Kingdom against Hulagu's rule in 1259–1260.&#91;72&#93;&#91;full citation needed&#93; Berke also forged an alliance with the Egyptian Mamluks against Hulagu and supported Kublai's rival claimant, Ariqboke.&#91;73&#93;
Hulagu died on 8 February 1264. Berke sought to take advantage and invade Hulagu's realm, but he died along the way, and a few months later Alghu Khan of the Chagatai Khanate died as well. Kublai named Hulagu's son Abaqa as new Ilkhan, and nominated Batu's grandson Möngke Temür to lead the Golden Horde. Abaqa sought foreign alliances, such as attempting to form a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Egyptian Mamluks.&#91;74&#93; Ariqboqe surrendered to Kublai at Shangdu on 21 August 1264.&#91;75&#93;
In the south, after the fall of Xiangyang in 1273, the Mongols sought the final conquest of the Song dynasty in South China. In 1271, Kublai renamed the new Mongol regime in China as the Yuan dynasty and sought to sinicize his image as Emperor of China to win the control of the Chinese people. Kublai moved his headquarters to Dadu, the genesis for what later became the modern city of Beijing. His establishment of a capital there was a controversial move to many Mongols who accused him of being too closely tied to Chinese culture.&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93;
The Mongols were eventually successful in their campaigns against (Song) China, and the Chinese Song imperial family surrendered to the Yuan in 1276, making the Mongols the first non-Chinese people to conquer all of China. Kublai used his base to build a powerful empire, creating an academy, offices, trade ports and canals, and sponsoring arts and science. Mongol records list 20,166 public schools created during his reign.&#91;78&#93;
After achieving actual or nominal dominion over much of Eurasia and successfully conquering China, Kublai pursued further expansion. His invasions of Burma and Sakhalin were costly, and his attempted invasions of Đại Việt (northern Vietnam) and Champa (southern Vietnam) ended in devastating defeat, but secured vassal statuses of those countries. The Mongol armies were repeatedly beaten in Đại Việt and were crushed at the Battle of Bạch Đằng (1288).
Nogai and Konchi, the khan of the White Horde, established friendly relations with the Yuan dynasty and the Ilkhanate. Political disagreement among contending branches of the family over the office of great khan continued, but the economic and commercial success of the Mongol Empire continued despite the squabbling.&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93;
Major changes occurred in the Mongol Empire in the late 1200s. Kublai Khan, after having conquered all of China and established the Yuan dynasty, died in 1294. He was succeeded by his grandson Temür Khan, who continued Kublai's policies. At the same time the Toluid Civil War, along with the Berke–Hulagu war and the subsequent Kaidu–Kublai war, greatly weakened the authority of the great khan over the entirety of the Mongol Empire and the empire fractured into autonomous khanates, the Yuan dynasty and the three western khanates: the Golden Horde, the Chagatai Khanate and the Ilkhanate. Only the Ilkhanate remained loyal to the Yuan court but endured its own power struggle, in part because of a dispute with the growing Islamic factions within the southwestern part of the empire.&#91;82&#93;
After the death of Kaidu, the Chatagai ruler Duwa initiated a peace proposal and persuaded the Ögedeids to submit to Temür Khan.&#91;83&#93;&#91;84&#93; In 1304, all of the khanates approved a peace treaty and accepted Yuan emperor Temür's supremacy.&#91;85&#93;&#91;86&#93;&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93; This established the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty over the western khanates, which was to last for several decades. This supremacy was based on weaker foundations than that of the earlier Khagans and each of the four khanates continued to develop separately and function as independent states.
Nearly a century of conquest and civil war was followed by relative stability, the Pax Mongolica, and international trade and cultural exchanges flourished between Asia and Europe. Communication between the Yuan dynasty in China and the Ilkhanate in Persia further encouraged trade and commerce between east and west. Patterns of Yuan royal textiles could be found on the opposite side of the empire adorning Armenian decorations; trees and vegetables were transplanted across the empire; and technological innovations spread from Mongol dominions toward the West.&#91;89&#93;&#91;citation needed&#93; Pope John XXII was presented a memorandum from the eastern church describing the Pax Mongolica: "... Khagan is one of the greatest monarchs and all lords of the state, e.g., the king of Almaligh (Chagatai Khanate), emperor Abu Said and Uzbek Khan, are his subjects, saluting his holiness to pay their respects."&#91;90&#93; However, while the four khanates continued to interact with one another well into the 14th century, they did so as sovereign states and never again pooled their resources in a cooperative military endeavor.&#91;91&#93;
In spite of his conflicts with Kaidu and Duwa, Yuan emperor Temür established a tributary relationship with the war-like Shan people after his series of military operations against Thailand from 1297 to 1303. This was to mark the end of the southern expansion of the Mongols.
When Ghazan took the throne of the Ilkhanate in 1295, he formally accepted Islam as his own religion, marking a turning point in Mongol history after which Mongol Persia became more and more Islamic. Despite this, Ghazan continued to strengthen ties with Temür Khan and the Yuan dynasty in the east. It was politically useful to advertise the great khan's authority in the Ilkhanate, because the Golden Horde in Russia had long made claims on nearby Georgia.&#91;82&#93; Within four years, Ghazan began sending tribute to the Yuan court and appealing to other khans to accept Temür Khan as their overlord. He oversaw an extensive program of cultural and scientific interaction between the Ilkhanate and the Yuan dynasty in the following decades.&#91;93&#93;
Ghazan's faith may have been Islamic, but he continued his ancestors' war with the Egyptian Mamluks, and consulted with his old Mongolian advisers in his native tongue. He defeated the Mamluk army at the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in 1299, but he was only briefly able to occupy Syria, due to distracting raids from the Chagatai Khanate under its de facto ruler Kaidu, who was at war with both the Ilkhans and the Yuan dynasty.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Struggling for influence within the Golden Horde, Kaidu sponsored his own candidate Kobeleg against Bayan (r. 1299–1304), the khan of the White Horde. Bayan, after receiving military support from the Mongols in Russia, requested assistance from both Temür Khan and the Ilkhanate to organize a unified attack against Kaidu's forces. Temür was amenable and attacked Kaidu a year later. After a bloody battle with Temür's armies near the Zawkhan River in 1301, Kaidu died and was succeeded by Duwa.&#91;94&#93;&#91;95&#93;
Duwa was challenged by Kaidu's son Chapar, but with the assistance of Temür, Duwa defeated the Ögedeids. Tokhta of the Golden Horde, also seeking a general peace, sent 20,000 men to buttress the Yuan frontier.&#91;96&#93; Tokhta died in 1312, though, and was succeeded by Ozbeg (r. 1313–41), who seized the throne of the Golden Horde and persecuted non-Muslim Mongols. The Yuan's influence on the Horde was largely reversed and border clashes between Mongol states resumed. Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan's envoys backed Tokhta's son against Ozbeg.&#91;citation needed&#93;
In the Chagatai Khanate, Esen Buqa I (r. 1309–1318) was enthroned as khan after suppressing a sudden rebellion by Ögedei's descendants and driving Chapar into exile. The Yuan and Ilkhanid armies eventually attacked the Chagatai Khanate. Recognising the potential economic benefits and the Genghisid legacy, Ozbeg reopened friendly relations with the Yuan in 1326. He strengthened ties with the Muslim world as well, building mosques and other elaborate structures such as baths.&#91;citation needed&#93; By the second decade of the 14th century, Mongol invasions had further decreased. In 1323, Abu Said Khan (r. 1316–35) of the Ilkhanate signed a peace treaty with Egypt. At his request, the Yuan court awarded his custodian Chupan the title of commander-in-chief of all Mongol khanates, but Chupan died in late 1327.&#91;97&#93;
Civil war erupted in the Yuan dynasty in 1328–29. After the death of Yesün Temür in 1328, Tugh Temür became the new leader in Dadu, while Yesün Temür's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu, leading to the civil war known as the War of the Two Capitals. Tugh Temür defeated Ragibagh, but the Chagatai khan Eljigidey (r. 1326–29) supported Kusala, elder brother of Tugh Temür, as great khan. He invaded with a commanding force, and Tugh Temür abdicated. Kusala was elected khan on 30 August 1329. Kusala was then poisoned by a Kypchak commander under Tugh Temür, who returned to power.
Tugh Temür (1304–32) was knowledgeable about Chinese language and history and was also a creditable poet, calligrapher, and painter. In order to be accepted by other khanates as the sovereign of the Mongol world, he sent Genghisid princes and descendants of notable Mongol generals to the Chagatai Khanate, Ilkhan Abu Said, and Ozbeg. In response to the emissaries, they all agreed to send tribute each year.&#91;98&#93; Furthermore, Tugh Temür gave lavish presents and an imperial seal to Eljigidey to mollify his anger.
With the death of Ilkhan Abu Said Bahatur in 1335, Mongol rule faltered and Persia fell into political anarchy. A year later his successor was killed by an Oirat governor, and the Ilkhanate was divided between the Suldus, the Jalayir, Qasarid Togha Temür (d. 1353), and Persian warlords. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Georgians pushed the Mongols out of their territory, and the Uyghur commander Eretna established an independent state (Ertenids) in Anatolia in 1336. Following the downfall of their Mongol masters, the loyal vassal, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, received escalating threats from the Mamluks and were eventually overrun.&#91;99&#93;
Along with the dissolution of the Ilkhanate in Persia, Mongol rulers in China and the Chagatai Khanate were also in turmoil. The plague known as the Black Death, which started in the Mongol dominions and spread to Europe, added to the confusion. Disease devastated all the khanates, cutting off commercial ties and killing millions.&#91;100&#93; Plague may have taken 50 ;million lives in Europe alone in the 14th century.&#91;101&#93;
As the power of the Mongols declined, chaos erupted throughout the empire as non-Mongol leaders expanded their own influence. The Golden Horde lost all of its western dominions (including modern Belarus and Ukraine) to Poland and Lithuania between 1342 and 1369. Muslim and non-Muslim princes in the Chagatai Khanate warred with each other from 1331 to 1343, and the Chagatai Khanate disintegrated when non-Genghisid warlords set up their own puppet khans in Transoxiana and Moghulistan. Janibeg Khan (r. 1342–1357) briefly reasserted Jochid dominance over the Chaghataids. Demanding submission from an offshoot of the Ilkhanate in Azerbaijan, he boasted that "today three uluses are under my control".&#91;102&#93;
However, rival families of the Jochids began fighting for the throne of the Golden Horde after the assassination of his successor Berdibek Khan in 1359. The last Yuan ruler Toghan Temür (r. 1333–70) was powerless to regulate those troubles, a sign that the empire had nearly reached its end. His court's unbacked currency had entered a hyperinflationary spiral and the Han-Chinese people revolted due to the Yuan's harsh impositions. In the 1350s, Gongmin of Goryeo successfully pushed Mongolian garrisons back and exterminated the family of Toghan Temür Khan's empress while Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen managed to eliminate the Mongol influence in Tibet.&#91;102&#93;
Increasingly isolated from their subjects, the Mongols quickly lost most of China to the rebellious Ming forces and in 1368 fled to their heartland in Mongolia. After the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty the Golden Horde lost touch with Mongolia and China, while the two main parts of the Chagatai Khanate were defeated by Timur (Tamerlane) (1336–1405), who founded the Timurid Empire. However, remnants of the Chagatai Khanate survived; the last Chagataid state to survive was the Yarkent Khanate, until its defeat by the Oirat Dzungar Khanate in the Dzungar conquest of Altishahr in 1680. The Golden Horde broke into smaller Turkic-hordes that declined steadily in power over four centuries. Among them, the khanate's shadow, the Great Horde, survived until 1502, when one of its successors, the Crimean Khanate, sacked Sarai.&#91;103&#93; The Crimean Khanate lasted until 1783, whereas khanates such as the Khanate of Bukhara and the Kazakh Khanate lasted even longer.
The number of troops mustered by the Mongols is the subject of some scholarly debate,&#91;104&#93; but was at least 105,000 in 1206.&#91;105&#93; The Mongol military organization was simple but effective, based on the decimal system. The army was built up from squads of ten men each, arbans (10 people), zuuns (100), Mingghans (1000), and tumens (10,000).&#91;106&#93;
The Mongols were most famous for their horse archers, but troops armed with lances were equally skilled, and the Mongols recruited other military talents from the lands they conquered. With experienced Chinese engineers and a bombardier corps which was expert at building trebuchets, catapults and other machines, the Mongols could lay siege to fortified positions, sometimes building machinery on the spot using available local resources.&#91;106&#93;
Forces under the command of the Mongol Empire were trained, organized, and equipped for mobility and speed. Mongol soldiers were more lightly armored than many of the armies they faced but were able to make up for it with maneuverability. Each Mongol warrior would usually travel with multiple horses, allowing him to quickly switch to a fresh mount as needed. In addition, soldiers of the Mongol army functioned independently of supply lines, considerably speeding up army movement.&#91;107&#93; Skillful use of couriers enabled the leaders of these armies to maintain contact with each other.
Discipline was inculcated during a nerge (traditional hunt), as reported by Juvayni. These hunts were distinctive from hunts in other cultures, being the equivalent to small unit actions. Mongol forces would spread out in a line, surround an entire region, and then drive all of the game within that area together. The goal was to let none of the animals escape and to slaughter them all.&#91;107&#93;
Another advantage of the Mongols was their ability to traverse large distances, even in unusually cold winters; for instance, frozen rivers led them like highways to large urban centers on their banks. The Mongols were adept at river-work, crossing the river Sajó in spring flood conditions with thirty thousand cavalry soldiers in a single night during the Battle of Mohi (April 1241) to defeat the Hungarian king Béla IV. Similarly, in the attack against the Muslim Khwarezmshah a flotilla of barges was used to prevent escape on the river.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Traditionally known for their prowess with ground forces, the Mongols rarely used naval power. In the 1260s and 1270s they used seapower while conquering the Song dynasty of China, though their attempts to mount seaborne campaigns against Japan were unsuccessful. Around the Eastern Mediterranean, their campaigns were almost exclusively land-based, with the seas controlled by the Crusader and Mamluk forces.&#91;108&#93;
All military campaigns were preceded by careful planning, reconnaissance, and the gathering of sensitive information relating to enemy territories and forces. The success, organization, and mobility of the Mongol armies permitted them to fight on several fronts at once. All adult males up to the age of 60 were eligible for conscription into the army, a source of honor in their tribal warrior tradition.&#91;109&#93;
The Mongol Empire was governed by a code of law devised by Genghis, called Yassa, meaning "order" or "decree". A particular canon of this code was that those of rank shared much the same hardship as the common man. It also imposed severe penalties, e.g., the death penalty if one mounted soldier following another did not pick up something dropped from the mount in front. Penalties were also decreed for rape and to some extent for murder. Any resistance to Mongol rule was met with massive collective punishment. Cities were destroyed and their inhabitants slaughtered if they defied Mongol orders.&#91;citation needed&#93; Under Yassa, chiefs and generals were selected based on merit. The empire was governed by a non-democratic, parliamentary-style central assembly, called kurultai, in which the Mongol chiefs met with the great khan to discuss domestic and foreign policies. Kurultais were also convened for the selection of each new great khan.&#91;110&#93;
Genghis Khan also created a national seal, encouraged the use of a written alphabet in Mongolia, and exempted teachers, lawyers, and artists from taxes.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China and sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, thus using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands.&#91;111&#93; The Mongols were tolerant of other religions, and rarely persecuted people on religious grounds. This was associated with their culture and progressive thought. Some historians of the 20th century thought this was a good military strategy: when Genghis was at war with Sultan Muhammad of Khwarezm, other Islamic leaders did not join the fight, as it was seen as a non-holy war between two individuals.&#91;citation needed&#93;
At the time of Genghis Khan, virtually every religion had found Mongol converts, from Buddhism to Christianity, from Manichaeism to Islam. To avoid strife, Genghis Khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, though he himself was a shamanist. Under his administration, all religious leaders were exempt from taxation and from public service.&#91;112&#93;
Initially there were few formal places of worship because of the nomadic lifestyle. However, under Ögedei (1186–1241), several building projects were undertaken in the Mongol capital. Along with palaces, Ögedei built houses of worship for the Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and Taoist followers. The dominant religions at that time were Shamanism, Tengrism, and Buddhism, although Ögedei's wife was a Nestorian Christian.&#91;113&#93;
Eventually, each of the successor states adopted the dominant religion of the local populations: the Chinese-Mongolian Yuan dynasty in the East (originally the great khan's domain) embraced Buddhism and Shamanism, while the three Western khanates adopted Islam.&#91;114&#93;&#91;115&#93;&#91;116&#93;
The oldest surviving literary work in the Mongolian language is The Secret History of the Mongols, which was written for the royal family some time after Genghis Khan's death in 1227. It is the most significant native account of Genghis's life and genealogy, covering his origins and childhood through to the establishment of the Mongol Empire and the reign of his son, Ögedei.
Another classic from the empire is the Jami' al-tawarikh, or "Universal History". It was commissioned in the early 14th century by the Ilkhan Abaqa Khan as a way of documenting the entire world's history, to help establish the Mongols' own cultural legacy.
Mongol scribes in the 14th century used a mixture of resin and vegetable pigments as a primitive form of correction fluid;&#91;117&#93; this is arguably its first known usage.
The Mongols also appreciated the visual arts, though their taste in portraiture was strictly focused on portraits of their horses, rather than of people.
The Mongol Empire saw some significant developments in science due to the patronage of the Khans. Roger Bacon attributed the success of the Mongols as world conquerors principally to their devotion to mathematics.&#91;118&#93; Astronomy was one branch of science that the Khans took a personal interest in.  According to the Yuanshi, Ögedei Khan twice ordered the armillary sphere of Zhongdu to be repaired (in 1233 and 1236) and also ordered in 1234 the revision and adoption of the Damingli calendar.&#91;119&#93; He built a Confucian temple for Yelü Chucai in Karakorum around 1236 where Yelü Chucai created and regulated a calendar on the Chinese model. Möngke Khan was noted by Rashid al-Din as having solved some of the difficult problems of Euclidean geometry on his own and written to his brother Hulagu Khan to send him the astronomer Tusi.&#91;120&#93; Möngke Khan's desire to have Tusi build him an observatory in Karakorum did not reach fruition as the Khan died on campaign in southern China. Hulagu Khan instead gave Tusi a grant to build the Maragheh Observatory in Persia in 1259 and ordered him to prepare astronomical tables for him in 12 years, despite Tusi asking for 30 years. Tusi successfully produced the Ilkhanic Tables in 12 years, produced a revised edition of Euclid's elements and taught the innovative mathematical device called the Tusi couple. The Maragheh Observatory held around 400,000 books salvaged by Tusi from the siege of Baghdad and other cities. Chinese astronomers brought by Hulagu Khan worked there as well.
Kublai Khan built a number of large observatories in China and his libraries included the Wu-hu-lie-ti (Euclid) brought by Muslim mathematicians.&#91;121&#93;  Zhu Shijie and Guo Shoujing were notable mathematicians in Mongol-ruled China. The Mongol physician Hu Sihui described the importance of a healthy diet in a 1330 medical treatise.
Ghazan Khan, able to understand four languages including Latin, built the Tabriz Observatory in 1295. The Byzantine Greek astronomer Gregory Choniades studied there under Ajall Shams al-Din Omar who had worked at Maragheh under Tusi. Chioniades played an important role in transmitting several innovations from the Islamic world to Europe. These include the introduction of the universal latitude-independent astrolabe to Europe and a Greek description of the Tusi-couple, which would later have an influence on Copernican heliocentrism. Choniades also translated several Zij treatises into Greek, including the Persian Zij-i Ilkhani by al-Tusi and the Maragheh observatory. The Byzantine-Mongol alliance and the fact that the Empire of Trebizond was an Ilkhanate vassal facilitated Choniades' movements between Constantinople, Trebizond and Tabriz. Prince Radna, the Mongol viceroy of Tibet based in Gansu province, patronized the Samarkandi astronomer al-Sanjufini. The Arabic astronomical handbook dedicated by al-Sanjufini to Prince Radna, a descendant of Kublai Khan, was completed in 1363. It is notable for having Middle Mongolian glosses on its margins.&#91;122&#93;
The Mongol Empire had an ingenious and efficient mail system for the time, often referred to by scholars as the Yam. It had lavishly furnished and well-guarded relay posts known as örtöö set up throughout the Empire.&#91;123&#93; A messenger would typically travel 25 miles (40 ;km) from one station to the next, either receiving a fresh, rested horse, or relaying the mail to the next rider to ensure the speediest possible delivery. The Mongol riders regularly covered 125 miles (200 ;km) per day, better than the fastest record set by the Pony Express some 600 years later.&#91;citation needed&#93; The relay stations had attached households to service them. Anyone with a paiza was allowed to stop there for re-mounts and specified rations, while those carrying military identities used the Yam even without a paiza. Many merchants, messengers, and travelers from China, the Middle East, and Europe used the system. When the great khan died in Karakorum, news reached the Mongol forces under Batu Khan in Central Europe within 4–6 weeks thanks to the Yam.&#91;49&#93;
Genghis and his successor Ögedei built a wide system of roads, one of which carved through the Altai mountains. After his enthronement, Ögedei further expanded the road system, ordering the Chagatai Khanate and Golden Horde to link up roads in western parts of the Mongol Empire.&#91;124&#93;
Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty, built special relays for high officials, as well as ordinary relays, that had hostels. During Kublai's reign, the Yuan communication system consisted of some 1,400 postal stations, which used 50,000 horses, 8,400 oxen, 6,700 mules, 4,000 carts, and 6,000 boats.&#91;citation needed&#93;
In Manchuria and southern Siberia, the Mongols still used dogsled relays for the yam. In the Ilkhanate, Ghazan restored the declining relay system in the Middle East on a restricted scale. He constructed some hostels and decreed that only imperial envoys could receive a stipend. The Jochids of the Golden Horde financed their relay system by a special yam tax.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The Mongols had a history of supporting merchants and trade. Genghis Khan had encouraged foreign merchants early in his career, even before uniting the Mongols. Merchants provided information about neighboring cultures, served as diplomats and official traders for the Mongols, and were essential for many goods, since the Mongols produced little of their own.
Mongol government and elites provided capital for merchants and sent them far afield, in an ortoq (merchant partner) arrangement.In Mongol times, the contractual features of a Mongol-ortoq partnership closely resembled that of qirad and commenda arrangements, however, Mongol investors were not constrained using uncoined precious metals and tradable goods for partnership investments and primarily financed money-lending and trade activities.&#91;125&#93; Moreover, Mongol elites formed trade partnerships with merchants from Italian cities, including Marco Polo’s family.&#91;126&#93; As the empire grew, any merchants or ambassadors with proper documentation and authorization received protection and sanctuary as they traveled through Mongol realms. Well-traveled and relatively well-maintained roads linked lands from the Mediterranean basin to China, greatly increasing overland trade and resulting in some dramatic stories of those who travelled through what would become known as the Silk Road.
Western explorer Marco Polo traveled east along the Silk Road, and the Chinese Mongol monk Rabban Bar Sauma made a comparably epic journey along the route, venturing from his home of Khanbaliq (Beijing) as far as Europe. European missionaries, such as William of Rubruck, also traveled to the Mongol court to convert believers to their cause, or went as papal envoys to correspond with Mongol rulers in an attempt to secure a Franco-Mongol alliance. It was rare, however, for anyone to journey the full length of Silk Road. Instead, merchants moved products like a bucket brigade, goods being traded from one middleman to another, moving from China all the way to the West; the goods moved over such long distances fetched extravagant prices.&#91;citation needed&#93;
After Genghis, the merchant partner business continued to flourish under his successors Ögedei and Güyük. Merchants brought clothing, food, information, and other provisions to the imperial palaces, and in return the great khans gave the merchants tax exemptions and allowed them to use the official relay stations of the Mongol Empire. Merchants also served as tax farmers in China, Russia and Iran. If the merchants were attacked by bandits, losses were made up from the imperial treasury.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Policies changed under the Great Khan Möngke. Because of money laundering and overtaxing, he attempted to limit abuses and sent imperial investigators to supervise the ortoq businesses. He decreed that all merchants must pay commercial and property taxes, and he paid off all drafts drawn by high-ranking Mongol elites from the merchants. This policy continued under the Yuan dynasty.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The fall of the Mongol Empire in the 14th century led to the collapse of the political, cultural, and economic unity along the Silk Road. Turkic tribes seized the western end of the route from the Byzantine Empire, sowing the seeds of a Turkic culture that would later crystallize into the Ottoman Empire under the Sunni faith. In the East, the native Chinese overthrew the Yuan dynasty in 1368, launching their own Ming dynasty and pursuing a policy of economic isolationism.&#91;127&#93;
The Mongol Empire ;— at its height of the largest contiguous empire in history ;— had a lasting impact, unifying large regions. Some of these (such as eastern and western Russia, and the western parts of China) remain unified today.&#91;128&#93; Mongols might have been assimilated into local populations after the fall of the empire, and some of their descendants adopted local religions; for example, the eastern khanate largely adopted Buddhism, and the three western khanates adopted Islam, largely under Sufi influence.&#91;114&#93;
According to some&#91;specify&#93; interpretations, Genghis Khan's conquests caused wholesale destruction on an unprecedented scale in certain geographic regions, leading to changes in the demographics of Asia.
The non-military achievements of the Mongol Empire include the introduction of a writing system, a Mongol alphabet based on the characters of the Uyghur language, which is still used in Mongolia today.&#91;129&#93;
Some of the other long-term consequences of the Mongol Empire include:

Güyük (1233)
The Mongol conquest of Eastern Xia was part of the conquest of China by the Mongol Empire. An initial conflict broke out in 1217 when the founder of Eastern Xia, Puxian Wannu, rebelled against the Mongol Empire. However, Wannu shortly afterward submitted to Mongol overlordship. Wannu later broke from the Mongols again, and in 1233 Ögedei Khan sent his son Güyük to conquer the kingdom. Eastern Xia was destroyed and Wannu executed.
Eastern Xia, also known as Dongxia or Dongzhen, was a kingdom founded by the warlord Puxian Wannu in 1215.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; Wannu served under the Jin dynasty during its war with the Mongol Empire. In late 1214, his army was defeated by the Eastern Liao, a vassal of the Mongols.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; The Jin capital, Zhongdu, fell to Muqali, and Wannu used the opportunity to establish a breakaway state, originally based in Liaoyang. After the Mongols defeated him in 1216, he sent his son Tege to the Mongols as a hostage in order to pledge his loyalty to the empire.&#91;2&#93;&#91;5&#93; In 1217, due to the futility of him establishing a kingdom in the area of Liaoning, he relocated to northeast Manchuria along the border with Korea.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;&#91;6&#93;
In 1217, Wannu attempted a rebellion against his Mongol allies.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; This was swiftly subdued, and Wannu accepted the Mongols as his lords.&#91;8&#93; In 1218, the Eastern Xia armies joined those of the Mongols in pursuit of remnants of the Khitan armies from the Later Liao dynasty which were invading Goryeo territory.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; Goryeo aided in these endeavors and accepted tributary status to the Mongol Empire and Eastern Xia.&#91;11&#93; Wannu over the next decade raided into Goryeo numerous times.&#91;3&#93;&#91;12&#93; At some point after 1221, Wannu broke from the Mongols, and in 1232 the Mongol Empire requested Goryeo to attack Eastern Xia. In 1233, as part of a punitive expedition into Goryeo to force that dynasty's compliance,&#91;3&#93;&#91;13&#93; Ögedai sent Güyük and Alchidai to subdue Eastern Xia.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; The Mongol armies quickly overwhelmed Eastern Xia and Wannu was beheaded.&#91;9&#93;&#91;16&#93; The conquered territory was given to the youngest brother of the late Genghis Khan, Temüge.&#91;6&#93;
The Jin dynasty fell the year after, completing the Mongol conquest of North China. The empire then, in 1235, launched invasions against Korea and the Song dynasty.&#91;14&#93; The conquest of all of China would not be complete until 1279 with the Battle of Yamen.&#91;17&#93;

Visual anthropology  is a subfield of social anthropology that is concerned, in part, with the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, new media.  More recently it has been used by historians of science and visual culture.&#91;1&#93;   Although sometimes wrongly conflated with ethnographic film, Visual Anthropology encompasses much more, including the anthropological study of all visual representations such as dance and other kinds of performance, museums and archiving, all visual arts, and the production and reception of mass media.  Histories and analyses of representations from many cultures are part of Visual Anthropology: research topics include sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs.  Also within the province of the subfield are studies of human vision, properties of media, the relationship of visual form and function, and applied, collaborative uses of visual representations.  Multimodal anthropology describes the latest turn in the subfield, which considers how emerging technologies like immersive virtual reality, augmented reality, mobile apps, social networking, gaming along with film, photography and art is reshaping anthropological research, practice and teaching.   
Even before the emergence of anthropology as an academic discipline in the 1880s, ethnologists used photography as a tool of research.&#91;2&#93;  Anthropologists and non-anthropologists conducted much of this work in the spirit of salvage ethnography or attempts to record for posterity the ways-of-life of societies assumed doomed to extinction (see, for instance, the Native American photography of Edward Curtis)&#91;3&#93;
The history of anthropological filmmaking is intertwined with that of non-fiction and documentary filmmaking, although ethnofiction may be considered as a genuine subgenre of ethnographic film. Some of the first motion pictures of the ethnographic other were made with Lumière equipment (Promenades des Éléphants à Phnom Penh, 1901).&#91;4&#93; Robert Flaherty, probably best known for his films chronicling the lives of Arctic peoples (Nanook of the North, 1922), became a filmmaker in 1913 when his supervisor suggested that he take a camera and equipment with him on an expedition north.  Flaherty focused on "traditional" Inuit ways of life, omitting with few exceptions signs of modernity among his film subjects (even to the point of refusing to use a rifle to help kill a walrus his informants had harpooned as he filmed them, according to Barnouw; this scene made it into Nanook where it served as evidence of their "pristine" culture).  This pattern would persist in many ethnographic films to follow (see as an example Robert Gardner's Dead Birds).
By the 1940s and early 1950s, anthropologists such as Hortense Powdermaker,&#91;5&#93; Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead (Trance and Dance in Bali, 1952) and Mead and Rhoda Metraux, eds., (The Study of Culture at a Distance, 1953) were bringing anthropological perspectives to bear on mass media and visual representation. Karl G. Heider notes in his revised edition of Ethnographic Film (2006) that after Bateson and Mead, the history of visual anthropology is defined by "the seminal works of four men who were active for most of the second half of the twentieth century: Jean Rouch, John Marshall, Robert Gardner, and Tim Asch. By focusing on these four, we can see the shape of ethnographic film" (p. ;15). Many, including Peter Loizos,&#91;6&#93; would add the name of filmmaker/author David MacDougall to this select group.
In 1966, filmmaker Sol Worth and anthropologist John Adair taught a group of Navajo Indians in Arizona how to capture 16mm film. The hypothesis was that artistic choices made by the Navajo would reflect the 'perceptual structure' of the Navajo world.&#91;7&#93;  The goals of this experiment were primarily ethnographic and theoretical. Decades later, however, the work has inspired a variety of participatory and applied anthropological initiatives - ranging from photovoice to virtual museum collections - in which cameras are given to local collaborators as a strategy for empowerment.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93;
In the United States, Visual Anthropology first found purchase in an academic setting in 1958 with the creation of the Film Study Center at Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.&#91;12&#93; In the United Kingdom, The Granada Centre for Visual Anthropology at the University of Manchester was established in 1987 to offer training in anthropology and film-making to MA, MPhil and PhD students and whose graduates have produced over 300 films to date. John Collier, Jr. wrote the first standard textbook in the field in 1967, and many visual anthropologists of the 1970s relied on semiologists like Roland Barthes for essential critical perspectives. Contributions to the history of Visual Anthropology include those of Emilie de Brigard (1967),&#91;13&#93; Fadwa el Guindi (2004),&#91;14&#93; and Beate Engelbrecht, ed. (2007).&#91;15&#93; A more recent history that understands visual anthropology in a broader sense, edited by Marcus Banks and Jay Ruby, is Made To Be Seen: Historical Perspectives on Visual Anthropology.&#91;16&#93; Turning the anthropological lens on India provides a counterhistory of visual anthropology (Khanduri 2014).&#91;17&#93;
At present, the Society for Visual Anthropology (SVA) represents the subfield in the United States as a section of the American Anthropological Association, the AAA.
In the United States, ethnographic films are shown each year at the Margaret Mead Film Festival as well as at the AAA's annual Film and Media Festival.&#91;18&#93; In Europe, ethnographic films are shown at the Royal Anthropological Institute Film Festival in the UK, The Jean Rouch Film Festival in France and Ethnocineca in Austria.  Dozens of other international festivals are listed regularly in the Newsletter of the Nordic Anthropological Film Association [NAFA].&#91;19&#93;
While art historians are clearly interested in some of the same objects and processes, visual anthropology places these artifacts within a holistic cultural context.  Archaeologists, in particular, use phases of visual development to try to understand the spread of humans and their cultures across contiguous landscapes as well as over larger areas.  By 10,000 BP, a system of well-developed pictographs was in use by boating peoples&#91;20&#93; and was likely instrumental in the development of navigation and writing, as well as a medium of storytelling and artistic representation.  Early visual representations often show the female form, with clothing appearing on the female body around 28,000 BP, which archaeologists know now corresponds with the invention of weaving in Old Europe.  This is an example of the holistic nature of visual anthropology: a figurine depicting a woman wearing diaphanous clothing is not merely an object of art, but a window into the customs of dress at the time, household organization (where they are found), transfer of materials (where the clay came from) and processes (when did firing clay become common), when did weaving begin, what kind of weaving is depicted and what other evidence is there for weaving, and what kinds of cultural changes were occurring in other parts of human life at the time.
Visual anthropology, by focusing on its own efforts to make and understand film, is able to establish many principles and build theories about human visual representation in general.

David MacDougall (born November 12, 1939) is an American visual anthropologist, academic, and documentary filmmaker, who is known for his ethnographic film work in Africa, Australia, Europe and India. For much of his career he co-produced and co-directed films with his wife, fellow filmmaker Judith MacDougall.&#91;1&#93; In 1972, his first film To Live with Herds was awarded the Grand Prix "Venezia Genti" at the Venice Film Festival.&#91;2&#93; MacDougall received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; He is currently a professor in the Research School of Humanities &amp; the Arts at Australian National University.&#91;5&#93; He has lived in Australia since 1975, and is considered one of the most prominent theorists in visual anthropology.&#91;6&#93; Both Judith and David are considered one of the most significant anthropological filmmakers in the English-speaking world.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;
MacDougall was born on November 12, 1939 in New Hampshire, United States, to a Canadian father and an American mother. He attended Dalton School in New York City till grade eighth and then transferred to The Putney School in Vermont. He went to Harvard University, where he received a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1961.&#91;11&#93; After Harvard, he enrolled in the ethnographic film program at the University of California, Los Angeles, graduating in 1968. He remained there to pursue a Master of Arts in film studies, which he received in 1970.&#91;1&#93;&#91;12&#93;
MacDougall began his career in 1972 when he made his first film To Live with Herds about the semi-nomadic pastoral Jie people in Uganda.&#91;13&#93; It won the Grand Prix "Venezia Genti" at the 1972 Venice Film Festival.&#91;14&#93; After this, MacDougall, along with his work partner and wife, Judith MacDougall, worked on the Turkana Conversations Trilogy.&#91;15&#93; The series investigated the lives of the Turkana people, semi-nomadic camel herders in Kenya.&#91;16&#93; Lorang's Way, released in 1977, was a portrait of the senior men of the Turkana, and won the first prize at the Cinéma du Réel in Paris in 1979.&#91;17&#93; The second film, The Wedding Camels, looks at the marriage of one of Lorang's daughters, and was awarded the Film Prize by the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1980.&#91;18&#93; After Africa, MacDougall's focus shifted to Australia, where he directed, or co-directed with his wife, a number of films on the indigenous communities, including Aboriginal Australians. These include films like Goodbye Old Man (1977), Takeover (1980), Stockman's Strategy (1984), and Link-Up Diary (1987).&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93;
After Australia, MacDougall made the Photo Wallahs in India in 1991 with Judith. The subject was the photographers and photography in the Indian hill town of Mussoorie.&#91;21&#93; MacDougall said in an interview, "Our first plan for the film was to look for a place where one photographer served a small community - a town with a resident photographer...Perhaps we were naive in thinking such photographers actually existed. If a town was big enough to have a photographer at all, it had twenty...We ended up making the film in one of the most heterogeneous towns one could imagine, a hill station called Mussoorie."&#91;22&#93; In 2009, his film Gandhi's Children was nominated for the Asia Pacific Screen Awards.&#91;23&#93; The setting of the documentary was a shelter for abandoned, runaway, or orphan children on the outskirts of New Delhi, where MacDougall lived for several months.&#91;24&#93;
Between 1996 and 2003, MacDougall worked on one of his most ambitious projects, The Doon School Quintet, a five-part ethnographic film series that was a long-term visual study of The Doon School, a boys' boarding school in the North Indian town of Dehradun. The then headmaster, John Mason, gave MacDougall unprecedented access for filming, and he stayed on campus with the boys between 1997 and 2000. From over eighty-five hours of collected material, he produced five documentary films, edited and released between 2000 and 2004. They studied the daily lives of the boys, the social aesthetics of the school, its rituals, traditions, material culture and language. "My primary interest in the school was as a crossing place for people from different backgrounds, how they got on with each other across class lines," MacDougall said in an interview. "But in the process of working on it, I actually became much more interested in the school as a kind of social organism, a micro-society with its own rules and rituals, and the films ended up being about the experience of students growing up in this kind of institution where they had to learn a whole new game plan, different from their previous lives which had been living with their family."&#91;25&#93;


A pest is any animal or plant detrimental to humans or human concerns. The term is particularly used for creatures that damage crops, livestock and forestry, or cause a nuisance to people, especially in their homes. Humans have modified the environment for their own purposes and are intolerant of other creatures occupying the same space when their activities impact adversely on human objectives. Thus, an elephant is unobjectionable in its natural habitat but a pest if it tramples crops.
Some animals are disliked because they bite or sting; snakes, wasps, ants, bed bugs, fleas and ticks belong in this category. Others enter the home thus invading our own private space; these include houseflies, which land on and contaminate food, beetles which tunnel into the woodwork, and other animals that scuttle about on the floor at night, like cockroaches, rats and mice, which are often associated with insanitary conditions.
Agricultural and horticultural crops are attacked by a wide variety of pests, the most important being insects, mites, nematodes and gastropod molluscs. The damage they do results both from the direct injury they cause to the plants, and from the indirect consequences of the fungal, bacterial or viral infections they transmit. Plants have their own defences against these attacks but these may be overwhelmed, especially in habitats where the plants are already stressed, or where the pests have been accidentally introduced and may have no natural enemies. The pests affecting trees are predominantly insects, and many of these have also been introduced inadvertently and lack natural enemies, and some have transmitted novel fungal diseases with devastating results. Humans have traditionally attempted to control the agricultural and forestry pests by the use of pesticides; however, they have gradually come to appreciate that many of these have unwanted consequences for the environment, and have tried to substitute integrated pest management strategies with biological pest controls.
A pest is any living thing, whether animal, plant or fungus, which humans consider troublesome to themselves, their possessions or the environment.&#91;1&#93; It is a loose concept, as an organism can be a pest in one setting but beneficial, domesticated or acceptable in another. Microorganisms, whether bacteria, microscopic fungi, protists, or viruses that cause trouble, on the other hand, are generally thought of as causes of disease (pathogens) rather than as pests.&#91;2&#93; An older usage of the word "pest" is of a deadly epidemic disease, specifically plague. In its broadest sense, a pest is a competitor to humanity.&#91;3&#93;

Animals are considered pests or vermin when they injure people or damage crops, forestry or buildings. Elephants are regarded as pests by the farmers whose crops they raid and trample. Mosquitoes and ticks are vectors that can transmit diseases, but are also pests because of the distress caused by their bites. Grasshoppers are usually solitary herbivores of little economic importance until the conditions are met for them to enter a swarming phase, become locusts and cause enormous damage.&#91;4&#93; Many people appreciate birds in the countryside and their gardens, but when these accumulate in large masses, they can be a nuisance. Flocks of starlings can consist of hundreds of thousands of individual birds, their roosts can be noisy and their droppings voluminous; the droppings are acidic and can cause corrosion of metals, stonework and brickwork as well as being unsightly. Pigeons in urban settings may be a health hazard, and gulls near the coast can become a nuisance, especially if they become bold enough to snatch food from passers-by. All birds are a risk at airfields where they can be sucked into aircraft engines.&#91;5&#93; Woodpeckers sometimes excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, causing structural damage;&#91;6&#93; they also drum on various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, down-spouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting.&#91;7&#93; Jellyfish can form vast swarms which may be responsible for damage to fishing gear, and sometimes clog the cooling systems of power and desalination plants which draw their water from the sea.&#91;8&#93;
Many of the animals that we regard as pests live in our homes. Before humans built dwellings, these creatures lived in the wider environment, but co-evolved with humans, adapting to the warm, sheltered conditions that a house provides, the wooden timbers, the furnishings, the food supplies and the rubbish dumps. Many no longer exist as free-living organisms in the outside world, and can therefore be considered to be domesticated.&#91;9&#93; The St Kilda house mouse rapidly became extinct when the last islander left the island of St Kilda, Scotland in 1930, but the St Kilda field mouse survived.&#91;10&#93;
Plants may be considered pests, for example if they are invasive species. There is no universal definition of what makes a plant a pest. Some governments, such as that of Western Australia, permit their authorities to prescribe as a pest plant "any plant that, in the local government authority's opinion, is likely to adversely affect the environment of the district, the value of property in the district, or the health, comfort or convenience of the district’s inhabitants."&#91;12&#93; An example of such a plant prescribed under this regulation is caltrop, Tribulus terrestris, which can cause poisoning in sheep and goats, but is mainly a nuisance around buildings, roadsides and recreation areas because of its uncomfortably sharp spiny burrs.&#91;11&#93;
The term "plant pest", mainly applied to insect micropredators of plants, has a specific definition in terms of the International Plant Protection Convention and phytosanitary measures worldwide. A pest is any species, strain or biotype of plant, animal, or pathogenic agent injurious to plants or plant products.&#91;13&#93; 
Plants have developed strategies that they use in their own defence, be they thorns (modified stems) or spines (modified leaves), stings, a thick cuticle or waxy deposits, with a second line of defence being toxic or distasteful secondary metabolites. Mechanical injury to the plant tissues allows entry of pathogens and stimulates the plant to mobilise its chemical defences. The plant soon seals off the wound to reduce further damage.&#91;14&#93;
Plants sometimes take active steps to reduce herbivory. Macaranga triloba for example has adapted its thin-walled stems to create ideal housing for an ant Crematogaster spp., which, in turn, protects the plant from herbivores. In addition to providing housing, the plant also provides the ant with its exclusive food source in the form of food bodies located on the leaf stipules.&#91;15&#93;  Similarly, several Acacia tree species have developed stout spines that are swollen at the base, forming a hollow structure that provides housing for ants which protect the plant. These Acacia trees also produce nectar in nectaries on their leaves as food for the ants.&#91;16&#93;
The animal groups of the greatest importance as agricultural pests are (in order of economic importance) insects, mites, nematodes and gastropod molluscs.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93;
Insects are responsible for two major forms of damage to crops. First there is the direct injury they cause to the plants as they feed on the tissues; a reduction in leaf surface available for photosynthesis, distortion of growing shoots, a diminution of the plant's growth and vigour, and the wilting of shoots and branches caused by the insects' tunnelling activities. Secondly there is the indirect damage, where the insects do little direct harm, but either transmit or allow entry of fungal, bacterial or viral infections.&#91;19&#93;  Although some insects are polyphagous, many are restricted to one specific crop, or group of crops. In many cases it is the larva that feeds on the plant, building up a nutritional store that will be used by the short-lived adult; sawfly and lepidopteran larvae feed mainly on the aerial portions of plants while beetle larvae tend to live underground, feeding on roots, or tunnel into the stem or under the bark. The true bugs, Hemiptera, have piercing and sucking mouthparts and live by sucking sap from plants. These include aphids, whiteflies and scale insects. Apart from weakening the plant, they encourage the growth of sooty mould on the honeydew the insects produce, which cuts out the light and reduces photosynthesis, stunting the plant's growth. They often transmit serious viral diseases between plants.&#91;20&#93;
The mites that cause most trouble in the field are the spider mites. These are less than 1 ;mm (0.04 ;in) in diameter, can be very numerous, and thrive in hot, dry conditions. They mostly live on the underside of leaves and puncture the plant cells to feed, with some species forming webbing. They occur on nearly all important food crops and ornamental plants, both outdoors and under glass, and include some of the most economically important pests.&#91;21&#93; Another important group of mites is the gall mites which affect a wide range of plants, several mite species being major pests causing substantial economic damage to crops. They can feed on the roots or the aerial parts of plants and transmit viruses.&#91;22&#93; Some examples are the big bud mite that transmits the reversion virus of blackcurrants,&#91;23&#93; the coconut mite which can devastate coconut production,&#91;24&#93; and the cereal rust mite which transmits several grass and cereal viruses.&#91;25&#93; Being exceedingly minute, many plant mites are spread by wind, although others use insects or other arthropods as a means to disperse.&#91;22&#93;
The nematodes (eelworms) that attack plants are minute, often too small to be seen with the naked eye, but their presence is often apparent in the galls or "knots" they form in plant tissues. Vast numbers of nematodes are found in soil and attack roots, but others affect stems, buds, leaves, flowers and fruits. High infestations cause stunting, deformation and retardation of plant growth, and the nematodes can transmit virus diseases from one plant to another.&#91;26&#93; When its populations are high, the potato cyst nematode can cause reductions of 80% in yield of susceptible potato varieties.&#91;27&#93;  The nematode eggs survive in the soil for many years, being stimulated to hatch by chemical cues produced by roots of susceptible plants.&#91;28&#93;
Slugs and snails are terrestrial gastropod molluscs which typically chew leaves, stems, flowers, fruit and vegetable debris. Slugs differ from snails in having shells that are too small for the animal to retract inside; the shell-less state has evolved on multiple occasions during the evolutionary development of molluscs, so there is little taxonomic difference between the two, and both slugs and snails do considerable damage to plants. With novel crops being grown and with insect pests having been brought more under control by biological and other means, the damage done by molluscs becomes of greater significance.&#91;29&#93; Terrestrial molluscs need moist environments; snails may be more noticeable because their shells provide protection from dessication, while most slugs live in soil and only come out to feed at night. They devour seedlings, damage developing shoots and feed on salad crops and cabbages, and some species tunnel into potatoes and other tubers.&#91;30&#93;

A weed is a plant considered undesirable in a particular situation; the term has no botanical significance. Often, weeds are simply those native plants that are adapted to grow in disturbed ground, the disturbance caused by ploughing and cultivation favouring them over other species. Any plant is a weed if it appears in a location where it is unwanted; Bermuda grass makes a good lawn plant under hot dry conditions but become a bad weed when it out-competes cultivated plants.&#91;32&#93;  
A different group of weeds consists of those that are invasive, introduced, often unintentionally, to habitats to which they are not native but in which they thrive. Without their original competitors, herbivores, and diseases, they may increase and become a serious nuisance.&#91;33&#93; One such plant is purple loosestrife, a native of Europe and Asia where it occurs in ditches, wet meadows and marshes; introduced into North America, it has no natural enemies to keep it in check, and has taken over vast tracts of wetlands to the exclusion of native species.&#91;34&#93;
In forestry, pests may affect various parts of the tree, from its roots and trunk to the canopy far overhead. The accessibility of the part of the tree affected may make detection difficult, so that a pest problem may already be far advanced before it is first observed from the ground. The larch sawfly and spruce budworm are two insect pests prevalent in Alaska and aerial surveys can show which sections of forest are being defoliated in any given year so that appropriate remedial action can be taken.&#91;35&#93; 
Some pests may not be present on the tree all year round, either because of their life cycle or because they rotate between different host species at different times of year.&#91;36&#93; The larvae of wood-boring beetles may spend years excavating tunnels under the bark of trees, and only emerge into the open for brief periods as adults, to mate and disperse. The import and export of timber has inadvertently assisted some insect pests to establish themselves far from their country of origin. An insect may be of little importance in its native range, being kept under control by parasitoid wasps, predators and the natural resistance of the host trees, but be a serious pest in a region into which it has been introduced.&#91;37&#93; This is the case with the emerald ash borer, an insect native to north-eastern Asia, which, since its arrival in North America, has killed millions of ash trees.&#91;38&#93;
Animals able to live in the dry conditions found in buildings include many arthropods such as beetles, cockroaches, moths, and mites. Another group, including termites, woodworm, longhorn beetles, and wood ants cause structural damage to buildings and furniture.&#91;39&#93; The natural habitat of these is the decaying parts of trees. The deathwatch beetle infests the structural timbers of old buildings, mostly attacking hardwood, especially oak. The initial attack usually follows the entry of water into a building and the subsequent decay of damp timber. Furniture beetles mainly attack the sapwood of both hard and soft wood, only attacking the heartwood when it is modified by fungal decay. The presence of the beetles only becomes apparent when the larvae gnaw their way out, leaving small circular holes in the timber.&#91;40&#93;
Carpet beetles and clothes moths cause non-structural damage to property such as clothing and carpets.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; It is the larvae that are destructive, feeding on wool, hair, fur, feathers and down. The moth larvae live where they feed, but the beetle larvae may hide behind skirting boards or in other similar locations between meals. They may be introduced to the home in any product containing animal fibres including upholstered furniture; the moths are feeble fliers but the carpet beetles may also enter houses through open windows.&#91;43&#93; Furniture beetles, carpet beetles and clothes moths are also capable of creating great damage to museum exhibits, zoological and botanical collections, and other cultural heritage items. Constant vigilance is required to prevent attack, and newly acquired items, and those that have been out on loan, may need quarantining before being added to the general collection.&#91;44&#93;
There are over four thousand species of cockroach worldwide, but only four species are commonly regarded as pests, having adapted to live permanently in buildings.&#91;45&#93; Considered to be a sign of insanitary conditions, they feed on almost anything, reproduce rapidly and are difficult to eradicate. They can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces, particularly in environments such as hospitals,&#91;46&#93; and are linked with allergic reactions in humans.&#91;47&#93;
Various insects attack dry food products, with flour beetles, the drugstore beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle and the Indianmeal moth being found worldwide. The insects may be present in the warehouse or may be introduced during shipping, in retail outlets or in the home; they may enter packets through tiny cracks or may chew holes in the packaging. The longer a product is stored, the more likely it is to become contaminated, with the insects often originating from dry pet foods.&#91;48&#93; 
Some mites, too, infest foodstuffs and other stored products. Each substance has its own specific mite, and they multiply with great rapidity. One of the most damaging is the flour mite, which is found in grain and may become exceedingly abundant in poorly stored material. In time, predatory mites usually move in and control the flour mites.&#91;49&#93;
The control of pests in crops is as old as civilisation. The earliest approach was mechanical, from ploughing to picking off insects by hand. Early methods included the use of sulphur compounds, before 2500 BC in Sumeria. In ancient China, insecticides derived from plants were in use by 1200 BC to treat seeds and to fumigate plants. Chinese agronomy recognised biological control by natural enemies of pests and the varying of planting time to reduce pests before the first century AD. The agricultural revolution in Europe saw the introduction of effective plant-based insecticides such as pyrethrum, derris, quassia, and tobacco extract. The phylloxera (a powdery mildew) damage to the wine industry in the 19th century resulted in the development of resistant varieties and grafting, and the accidental discovery of effective chemical pesticides, Bordeaux mixture (lime and copper sulphate) and Paris Green (an arsenic compound), both very widely used. Biological control also became established as an effective measure in the second half of the 19th century, starting with the vedalia beetle against cottony cushion scale. All these methods have been refined and developed since their discovery.&#91;50&#93;
Forest pests inflict costly damage, but treating them is often unaffordable, given the relatively low value of forest products compared to agricultural crops. It is also generally impossible to eradicate forest pests, given the difficulty of examining entire trees, and the certainty that pesticides would damage many forest organisms other than the intended pests. Forest integrated pest management therefore aims to use a combination of prevention, cultural control measures, and direct control (such as pesticide use). Cultural measures include choosing appropriate species, keeping competing vegetation under control, ensuring a suitable stocking density, and minimizing injury and stress to trees.&#91;51&#93;
Pest control in buildings can be approached in several ways, depending on the type of pest and the area affected. Methods include improving sanitation and garbage control, modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides.&#91;52&#93; For example, the pesticide Boron can be impregnated into the fibres of cellulose insulation to kill self-grooming insects such as ants and cockroaches.&#91;53&#93; Clothes moths can be controlled with airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating and the use of chemicals. Traditional mothballs deter adult moths with strong-smelling naphthalene; modern ones use volatile repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene. Moth larvae can be killed with insecticides such as permethrin or pyrethroids.&#91;54&#93; However, insecticides cannot safely be used in food storage areas; alternative treatments include freezing foods for four days at 0 ;°F (−18 ;°C) or baking for half an hour at 130 ;°F (54 ;°C) to kill any insects present.&#91;55&#93;


86th Street is a station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, located at 86th Street and Fourth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. It is served by the R train at all times.
The 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two island platforms, only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926&#8211;1927, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. The 86th Street station is also being renovated between 2018 and 2020, and elevators are being added to make the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
The 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several New York City Transit bus routes.
The 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. The plan for the line was initially adopted on June 1, 1905, before being approved by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York on June 18, 1906 after the Rapid Transit Commission was unable to get the necessary consents of property owners along the planned route.&#91;8&#93; The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the PSC approved the plan for the line in October and November 1907.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;
As part of negotiations between New York City and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913.&#91;9&#93; In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway from 43rd Street to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, was recommended. This recommendation was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its chief engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912. The two contracts for the extension, Route 11B, were awarded on September 16, 1912, to Degnon Construction Company for a combined $3.8 million (equivalent to $100.7 million in 2019).&#91;9&#93;
On January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street. Construction was completed on this section in 1915.&#91;8&#93; 86th Street opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street.&#91;3&#93;&#91;11&#93; The station was the original terminal for the line&#91;12&#93; until a one-stop southward extension to Bay Ridge–95th Street opened on October 25, 1925.&#91;13&#93;
On June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, Bay Ridge Avenue's platforms would have been lengthened from 495 feet (151 ;m) to 530 feet (160 ;m).&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; Progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 (equivalent to $9,228,000&#32;in 2019) (equivalent to $9,228,347&#32;in 2019). The BMT had been ordered by the Transit Commission to lengthen these platforms since September 1923.&#91;16&#93; The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926.&#91;17&#93; The contract was awarded to Corson Construction Company for $345,021 (equivalent to $4,983,000&#32;in 2019) (equivalent to $4,982,700&#32;in 2019).&#91;18&#93; The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.&#91;19&#93;
In the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to 615 feet (187 ;m) to accommodate 10-car trains.&#91;20&#93; On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including Bay Ridge Avenue, to W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 (equivalent to $50,492&#32;in 2019) in preparation of the construction of platform extensions (equivalent to $50,492&#32;in 2019).&#91;21&#93; The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street station and Bay Ridge–95th Street, including this station, on May 3, 1968.&#91;22&#93;  
However, work had already started on the platform extension project in February 1968. As part of the renovation project, the station's platform were extended 85 feet (26 ;m) to the south,&#91;20&#93;&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93; and the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were removed. The latter change, which was also made to 15 other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Line, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have "any great artistic merit".&#91;25&#93;
In 2007, then-13th District Congressman Vito Fossella and 22nd District State Senator Marty Golden secured funding for an $13.8 ;million renovation, completed in 2011. The renovation repaired staircases, rebuilt the station's ventilation, and installed new tiling for walls and floors as well as ADA-compliant yellow safety treads along the platform edges. The platform walls were originally tiled, but removed during renovations in 1970. The modern renovation restored these tiles, and added an Arts for Transit glass mosaic inspired by the old homes of the Bay Ridge neighborhood.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;
Plans call for the addition of two elevators, one from the mezzanine to the platform and the other from the mezzanine to the street, which would make the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.&#91;29&#93; Construction on the elevators started in June 2018&#91;30&#93; and elevator completed by May 28, 2020.&#91;31&#93;
This underground station has two tracks and a single island platform.&#91;32&#93; The R stops here at all times.&#91;33&#93;
The platform and mezzanines above have dark green columns, and alternate columns have the standard black station name plate with white lettering reading "86 Street".&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93; The track walls had their mosaic tiling restored as part of the station's 2011 renovation.&#91;36&#93;&#91;34&#93; The southern section of the station is where the platform was extended in 1970, and they have no mosaic trims or tiles along the wall, instead including an extension of the tunnel benchwall.&#91;23&#93; The platform has several employee-facilities that have a mosaic trim line.&#91;37&#93;
The station is built on the west side of Fourth Avenue due to plans for a possible extension of the express tracks south of 59th Street.&#91;38&#93; The platform is located between what would be the two southbound tracks as north of this station, the current southbound track swings out around the platform while the northbound one remains straight.&#91;32&#93; The additional two tracks would have been built on the eastern side of Fourth Avenue.&#91;3&#93;&#91;38&#93;&#91;8&#93; The four tracks were planned mainly to facilitate the Staten Island Tunnel, which would have necessitated express service, although the tunnel was never constructed.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; In addition, there are large portions of the mezzanines that are now used for employees only.&#91;38&#93;&#91;41&#93;
This station has two entrances/exits. The full-time one is at the south end. Two staircases from the platform go up to a mezzanine that has a turnstile bank and bodega within fare control.&#91;42&#93;&#91;43&#93; Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two staircases going up to either southern corner of 86th Street and Fourth Avenue.&#91;44&#93;&#91;45&#93;
The station's other fare control area is unstaffed. Two staircases from the platform, one of which is now closed,&#91;46&#93; go up to a mezzanine that has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and a single staircase going up to the southwest corner of 85th Street and Fourth Avenue. Both mezzanines have their original mosaic trim line.&#91;26&#93;&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93;
The station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several New York City Transit lines, including the S53 local and S93 limited buses and the S79 Select Bus Service to Staten Island.&#91;4&#93;&#91;45&#93;&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93;


Bay Ridge–95th Street (originally 95th Street–Fort Hamilton) is the southern terminal station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Despite the name, the station is located in the neighborhood of Fort Hamilton (as its original name implied) at the intersection of 95th Street and Fourth Avenue in southwestern Brooklyn. It is served by the R train at all times.
The station was first planned in 1922 as the first part of an extension to Staten Island through a tunnel under the Narrows. Construction began on December 17, 1923, after the construction contractor submitted, withdrew, and resubmitted its bid. The station opened on October 31, 1925, but the Staten Island extension was never built due to various funding disputes. The platform was lengthened in the 1960s.
On August 25, 1922, the Transit Commission directed its chief engineer, Robert Ridgeway, to plan an extension of the Fourth Avenue Line from 87th Street to Fort Hamilton. Initially, multiple stations along the extension were considered. This extension was to be the first part of an extension to Staten Island through a tunnel under The Narrows.&#91;6&#93; On September 12, 1922, a meeting was held by the Transit Commission to determine whether a stop at 91st Street should be included as part of the planned extension. Ultimately, no station was built at 91st Street.&#91;7&#93; At the meeting it was decided that money for an additional station in between 86th Street and the new terminal at 95th Street would be better spent on an extensive terminal with entrances at 93rd, 94th, and 95th Streets.&#91;8&#93; Other extensions were also planned in 1922: a branch of the line running via 86th Street to 18th Avenue to connect with the New Utrecht Line to Coney Island, Route 19, and the future subway under Tenth Avenue, as well as a branch of the line at 67th Street heading to Staten Island, Route 20.&#91;9&#93;
On December 28, 1922, the Transit Commission announced that it had awarded the contract for the construction of a half-mile extension of the Fourth Avenue Line, Contract 11B,&#91;10&#93; to T. A. Gillespie Company for $1.5 ;million (equivalent to $23 million in 2019). However, as the Board of Estimate failed to take action upon it, the contractor withdrew its bid on March 7, 1923.&#91;11&#93; The Transit Commission blamed the Board of Estimate for delays in the awarding of the contract; the Commission said that the city would suffer a substantial loss due to increased construction costs, and because the contract that was given was "highly advantageous to the city."&#91;12&#93; As part of Contract 11B, the extension was built with two tracks, with the exception of a short three-track stretch just north of the terminal at 95th Street.&#91;13&#93; The extension was to be built with a provision to extend the line to Staten Island.&#91;14&#93; As a result of a motion made by Commissioner LeRoy Harkness in front of the Transit Commission, the contract was set to be put back up for bid.&#91;15&#93; On November 2, 1923, the Board of Estimate approved the contract for the line with T. A. Gillespie Company, the same contractor that had bid on the project earlier, but withdrew. The Transit Commission, due to the delay of the project, gave orders on November 3 to speed up the completion of the project.&#91;16&#93; Construction began on December 17, 1923.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; The final extension to 95th Street, Route 18, opened on October 31, 1925,&#91;3&#93;&#91;17&#93; with the first train leaving at 2 ;p.m.&#91;3&#93;
In the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to 615 feet (187 ;m) to accommodate 10-car trains.&#91;19&#93; On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including 95th Street, to W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 (equivalent to $50,492&#32;in 2019) in preparation of the construction of platform extensions.&#91;20&#93; The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street and this station on May 3, 1968.&#91;21&#93; However, work had already started on the platform extension project in February. The platform at 95th Street was extended by 85 feet (26 ;m) to the south.&#91;22&#93;
This underground station has two tracks and one island platform.&#91;23&#93; The tracks end at bumper blocks at the south end of the platform.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; North of this station, a center layup track forms just north of the diamond crossover, before ending at a bumper block just south of 86th Street station.&#91;24&#93; The R stops here at all times.&#91;26&#93;
The platform has yellow painted I-beam columns and alternate ones have "95 Street" signs on them.&#91;27&#93; Both platform walls have their original mosaic trim line with name tablets reading "95TH STREET" along the entire station except for a small section at the north end, where the platform was extended in 1970.&#91;28&#93; Here, the wall is bare black.&#91;29&#93; The platforms were originally 530 feet (160 ;m) in length.&#91;23&#93; The station was constructed with a signal tower and dispatcher's office.&#91;23&#93;
The station has two mezzanines above the platform and tracks. Mosaic directional signs indicate they were originally one full-length mezzanine.&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; The closed-off sections are now used for employee-only spaces.&#91;31&#93; The station's larger, full-time mezzanine is at the south end. It has two staircases from the platform, a turnstile bank,&#91;32&#93; a token booth,&#91;33&#93; and two restrooms.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93; In addition, two staircases going up to either western corners of Fourth Avenue and 95th Street. A passageway leads to another staircase on the east side of the intersection, built inside an alcove of 9425 Fifth Avenue.&#91;36&#93; The station's other mezzanine is unstaffed, containing one staircase from the platform,&#91;37&#93; high entry/exit turnstiles,&#91;30&#93; and two staircases going up to either southern corners of 93rd Street and Fourth Avenue.&#91;38&#93; Additional exits were planned at 94th Street, but were never built.&#91;39&#93;
The station is built on the west side of Fourth Avenue due to plans for a possible extension of the express tracks south of 59th Street.&#91;40&#93; This station had been built mainly to facilitate the Staten Island Tunnel, which would have necessitated express service, although the tunnel was never constructed.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93;
South of this station, there is a false wall at the end of the tracks for a planned extension to 100th or 101st Street&#91;43&#93; and into the never-built Staten Island Tunnel, connecting the BMT line with the Staten Island Railway (SIRT) Main Line near its Grasmere station. The station would have also connected with the now-defunct South Beach Branch by disconnecting it from the SIRT main line, with the BMT Fourth Avenue Subway taking over service from the SIRT's Fort Wadsworth station to the Wentworth Avenue terminal. At the time it would have been a very different line had this tunnel been built, with through BMT service from Queensboro Plaza to Wentworth Avenue in Staten Island stopping at this station before proceeding to Staten Island, since this station is also the closest point to Staten Island. There were also plans to construct an underground storage yard here. The SIRT had been electrified in preparation for the tunnel, and had purchased subway cars similar to the AB Standards of the BMT.&#91;44&#93;
The tunnel plan was amended in 1919, moving its location north to Shore Road in Bay Ridge.&#91;45&#93; A groundbreaking ceremony was held by New York City Mayor John Hylan on April 14, 1923 in Bay Ridge&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93; and in Staten Island on July 19.&#91;48&#93;&#91;49&#93; In 1925, however—the year bids from contractors were to be entertained by the city—the project was halted and the project's engineering staff laid off.&#91;48&#93; Officially, the plan was delayed due to lack of funding,&#91;50&#93;&#91;51&#93; but Hylan and New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) Chairman John Delaney also wanted to secure freight service for the tunnel.&#91;48&#93;&#91;52&#93; These disagreements caused deadlocks between the parties involved.&#91;48&#93;
Later proposals surfaced to connect the station to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, which follows the route of the planned tunnel. The bridge was completed in 1964 without provisions for rail traffic.&#91;41&#93;&#91;44&#93;&#91;53&#93;

Undeclared Wars with Israel: East Germany and the West German Far Left, 1967–1989 is a book by Jeffrey Herf, published by Cambridge University Press in 2015. The book argues that East Germany in particular was extremely hostile to Israel and waged "undeclared wars" against it by funding Arab militant groups and other anti-Israel actions.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; The book received positive reviews for being well researched and uncovering new information on East Germany's relationship with Israel.
The book discusses the period between the Six-Day War in 1967 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, chronicling such incidents as the Munich massacre (1972), Yom Kippur War (1973), the Kiryat Shmona and Ma'alot terror attacks in Israel in 1975, the "Zionism is racism"  declaration (1975), the Entebbe hijacking and attacks on theaters that screened Victory at Entebbe (1976), Lebanon War, and West Berlin discotheque bombing (1986).&#91;3&#93; 
His approach, in contrast to German historians who have examined the same subject, includes as sources Jewish victims of attacks.&#91;4&#93; He also draws on extensive archive research in SED's Politburo,  the GDR Council of  Ministers, the GDR's foreign and defense ministries, and elsewhere.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;
According to Herf's research, the East German state sent "750,000 Kalashnikov assault weapons; 120 MiG fighter jets; 180,000 anti-personnel land mines; 235,000 grenades; 25,000 rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers; and 25 million cartridges of various sizes" to countries and groups at war with Israel. Some of these went to the PLO, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the  Popular   Front   for the Liberation of Palestine.&#91;6&#93; Herf describes how East Germany funded Palestinian militant groups&#91;7&#93; and West German radical leftists were trained by Fatah,  the  PFLP, and other groups to carry out attacks on Israeli targets. He also discusses the "propaganda war against Israel" waged at the United Nations and other international organizations.&#91;4&#93; Using anti-Israel actions, East Germany was able to obtain diplomatic recognition outside the Eastern Bloc, from countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Syria, and Egypt. Herf finds that the East German government distinguished between "moderates" and "extremists" in the Arab world:&#91;7&#93;
Herf notes the difference between West Germany, which had an "eleventh commandment" of doing no harm to Jews, and East Germany, which had no such premise.&#91;8&#93; He praises the role of West German Jewish leader Heinz Galinski, who wrote editorials denouncing antisemitism on the left. In contrast, Herf is critical of Willy Brandt, because "The West German chancellor who famously kneeled in an act of atonement at the memorial to the Jews killed in the Warsaw Ghetto declared his country to be neutral in the most dire days in Israel’s history since 1948 [the Yom Kippur war]."&#91;3&#93; He describes the essay of Ulrike Meinhof defending the Munich massacre as "one of the most important documents in the history of antisemitism in Europe after the Holocaust".&#91;3&#93;
In Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Russell Berman  praised the book for being well researched. He writes that the book sheds light on "an important study of a difficult and multidimensional chapter in the history of Germans and Jews".&#91;3&#93;
Martin Jander ;&#91;de&#93; praised Herf's "excellent   analysis".&#91;4&#93; 
Pertti Ahonen ;&#91;fi&#93; described it as a "meticulously researched study", although one that sometimes gets bogged down in repetitive arguments and excessive detail on arms shipments.&#91;9&#93;
Allan Arkush describes the book "prodigiously researched indictment" and "a timely reminder" but predicts that the "tale of two hatreds would [not] shame" those who continue the politics Herf describes in the present.&#91;7&#93;

The Ituri Rainforest is a rainforest located in the Ituri Province of northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo formerly called Zaire.  The forest's name derives from the nearby Ituri River which flows through the rainforest, connecting firstly to the Aruwimi River and finally into the Congo.
The Ituri Rainforest is about 63,000 square kilometers in area, and is located between 0° and 3°N and 27° and 30° E.  Elevation in the Ituri ranges from about 700 m to 1000 m.  The average temperature is 31°C (88°F) and the average humidity is about 85% (Wilkie 1987).&#91;1&#93;  About one-fifth of the rainforest is made up of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, a World Heritage Site.  
It is also the home of the Mbuti pygmies, one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below one and a half metres, or 59 inches, on average). They were the subject of research by a variety of outsiders, including Patrick and Anne Eisner Putnam who lived on the banks of the Epulu River at the edge of the Ituri. They were also the subject of a study by Colin Turnbull, The Forest People, in 1962.
The Ituri Rain forest was first traversed by Europeans in 1887 by Henry Morton Stanley on his Emin Pasha Relief Expedition.

 Chilean Government
 Chilean Armed Forces
The 1973 Chilean coup d'état was the overthrow of the socialist President of Chile Salvador Allende by the army and national police.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; It followed an extended period of social unrest and political tension between the opposition-controlled Congress of Chile and the socialist President Salvador Allende, as well as economic warfare ordered by US President Richard Nixon.&#91;7&#93;
The military deposed Allende's Popular Unity government and later established a junta that suspended all political activity in Chile and repressed left-wing movements, especially communist and socialist parties and the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). Allende's appointed army chief, Augusto Pinochet, rose to supreme power within a year of the coup and formally assumed power in late 1974.&#91;8&#93; The Nixon administration, which had worked to create the conditions for the coup,&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; promptly recognized the junta government and supported it in consolidating power.&#91;12&#93;
During the air raids and ground attacks that preceded the coup, Allende gave his final speech, vowing to stay in the presidential palace and refusing offers of safe passage should he choose exile over confrontation.&#91;13&#93; Direct witness accounts of Allende's death agree that he killed himself in the palace.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93;
Before the coup, Chile had been hailed as a beacon of democracy and political stability for decades, a period in which the rest of South America had been plagued by military juntas and caudillismo. The collapse of Chilean democracy ended a succession of democratic governments in Chile, which had held democratic elections since 1932.&#91;16&#93; Historian Peter Winn characterised the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in the history of Chile.&#91;17&#93; A weak insurgent movement against the Pinochet regime was maintained inside Chile by elements sympathetic to the former Allende government. An internationally supported plebiscite in 1988 held under the auspices of the military dictatorship was followed by a peaceful transition to an elected civilian government.
Allende contested the 1970 presidential election with Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez of the National Party and Radomiro Tomic of the Christian Democratic Party. Allende received 36.6% of the vote. Alessandri was a very close second with 35.3%, and Tomic third with 28.1%.&#91;18&#93; Although Allende received the highest number of votes, according to the Chilean constitution and since none of the candidates won by an absolute majority, the National Congress had to decide among the candidates.&#91;19&#93;
The 1925 constitution did not allow a person to be president for two consecutive terms. The incumbent president, Eduardo Frei Montalva, was therefore ineligible as a candidate. The CIA's "Track I" operation was a plan to influence the Congress to choose Alessandri, who would resign after a short time in office, forcing a second election. Frei would then be eligible to run.&#91;20&#93; Alessandri announced on 9 September that if Congress chose him, he would resign. Congress then decided on Allende. Soon after hearing news of his win, Allende signed a Statute of Constitutional Guarantees, which stated that he would follow the constitution during his presidency.&#91;21&#93;
The U.S. feared the example of a "well-functioning socialist experiment" in the region and exerted diplomatic, economic, and covert pressure upon Chile's elected socialist government.&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93; At the end of 1971, the Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro made a four-week state visit to Chile, alarming Western observers worried about the "Chilean Way to Socialism".&#91;25&#93;
In 1972, economics minister Pedro Vuskovic adopted monetary policies that increased the amount of circulating currency and devalued the escudo, which increased inflation to 140 percent in 1972 and engendered a black market economy.&#91;26&#93;
In October 1972, Chile suffered the first of many strikes. Among the participants were small-scale businessmen, some professional unions, and student groups. Its leaders – Vilarín, Jaime Guzmán, Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton, Eduardo Arriagada – expected to depose the elected government. Other than damaging the national economy, the principal effect of the 24-day strike was drawing Army head, Gen. Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister, an appeasement to the right wing.&#91;26&#93; (Gen. Prats had succeeded Army head Gen. René Schneider after his assassination on 24 October 1970 by a group led by Gen. Roberto Viaux, whom the Central Intelligence Agency had not attempted to discourage.) Gen. Prats supported the legalist Schneider Doctrine and refused military involvement in a coup d'état against President Allende.&#91;27&#93;
Despite the declining economy, President Allende's Popular Unity coalition increased its vote to 43.2% in the March 1973 parliamentary elections; but, by then, the informal alliance between Popular Unity and the Christian Democrats ended.&#91;28&#93; The Christian Democrats allied with the right-wing National Party, who were opposed to Allende's government; the two right-wing parties formed the Confederation of Democracy (CODE). The internecine parliamentary conflict between the legislature and the executive branch paralyzed the activities of government.&#91;29&#93;
Allende began to fear his opponents, convinced they were plotting his assassination. Using his daughter as a messenger, he explained the situation to Fidel Castro. Castro gave four pieces of advice: convince technicians to stay in Chile, only sell copper for US dollars, avoid extreme revolutionary acts which would give opponents an excuse to wreck or control the economy, and maintain a proper relationship with the Chilean military until local militias could be established and consolidated. Allende attempted to follow Castro's advice, but the latter two recommendations proved difficult.&#91;30&#93;
Prior to the coup, the Chilean military had undergone a process of de-politicization since the 1920s, when military personnel participated in government positions. Subsequently, most military officers remained under-funded, having only subsistence salaries. Because of the low salaries, the military spent much time in military leisure-time facilities (e.g. country clubs) where they met other officers and their families. The military remained apart from society, and was to some degree an endogamous group as officers frequently married the sisters of their comrades or the daughters of high-ranked older officers. Many officers had also relatives in the military.&#91;31&#93; In 1969 elements of the military made their first act of rebellion in 40 years when they participated in the Tacnazo insurrection. The Tacnazo was not a proper coup, but a protest against under-funding.&#91;32&#93; In retrospect General Carlos Prats considered that Christian Democrats who were in power in 1969 committed the error of not taking the military's grievances seriously.&#91;33&#93;
Governments of Argentina (1966), Bolivia (1969), Brazil (1964) and Peru (1968) were all overthrown in coups and replaced by military governments.&#91;34&#93; In June 1973 Uruguay joined the coup d'état wave that swept through the region.&#91;35&#93; The poor conditions of the Chilean military contrasted with the change of fortune the military of neighboring countries experienced as they came to power in coups.&#91;34&#93;
During the decades prior to the coup, the military became influenced by the United States' anti-communist ideology in the context of various cooperation programs including the US Army School of the Americas.&#91;31&#93;
On 29 June 1973, Colonel Roberto Souper surrounded the La Moneda presidential palace with his tank regiment and failed to depose the Allende Government.&#91;36&#93; That failed coup d’état – known as the Tanquetazo tank putsch – had been organized by the nationalist "Fatherland and Liberty" paramilitary group.
In August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred; the Supreme Court publicly complained about the government's inability to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats united with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.&#91;29&#93;
For months, the government had feared calling upon the Carabineros national police, suspecting them of disloyalty. On 9 August, Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. He was forced to resign both as defence minister and as the Army commander-in-chief on 24 August 1973, embarrassed by the Alejandrina Cox incident and a public protest of the wives of his generals at his house. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.&#91;29&#93; In late August 1973, 100,000&#91;disputed&#32; &#8211; discuss&#93; Chilean women congregated at Plaza de la Constitución to protest against the government for the rising cost and increasing shortages of food and fuels, but they were dispersed with tear gas.&#91;37&#93;
On 22 August 1973, with the support of the Christian Democrats and National Party members, the Chamber of Deputies passed 81–47 a resolution that asked "the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces"&#91;38&#93; to "put an immediate end" to "breach[es of] the Constitution . . . with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans."
The resolution declared that the Allende Government sought ". . . to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State . . . [with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system", claiming it had made "violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct." Essentially, most of the accusations were about the government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks.
It can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow the government if it did not comply, as follows "...To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law."&#91;39&#93;
Two days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the Congress' declaration as "destined to damage the country’s prestige abroad and create internal confusion", predicting "It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors". He noted that the declaration had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority "constitutionally required" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress was "invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government" and "subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will".&#91;40&#93;
Allende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet "at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism". In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a coup d’état or a civil war with a declaration "full of affirmations that had already been refuted before-hand" and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.
President Allende wrote: "Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives".
Adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said means—having already "paralyzed" the State—they sought to "destroy" it. He concluded by calling upon "the workers, all democrats and patriots" to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the "revolutionary process".&#91;40&#93;
Although CIA did not instigate the coup that ended Allende's government on 11 September 1973, it was aware of coup-plotting by the military, had ongoing intelligence collection relationships with some plotters, and—because CIA did not discourage the takeover and had sought to instigate a coup in 1970—probably appeared to condone it. The report stated that the CIA "actively supported the military Junta after the overthrow of Allende but did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency."&#91;45&#93; After a review of recordings of telephone conversations between Nixon and Henry Kissinger, Robert Dallek concluded that both of them used the CIA to actively destabilize the Allende government. In one particular conversation about the news of Allende's overthrow, Kissinger complains about the lack of recognition of the American role in the overthrow of a "communist" government, upon which Nixon remarked, "Well, we didn't – as you know – our hand doesn't show on this one."&#91;46&#93; A later CIA report contended that US agents maintained close ties with the Chilean military to collect intelligence but no effort was made to assist them and "under no circumstances attempted to influence them."&#91;47&#93;
Historian Peter Winn found "extensive evidence" of United States complicity in the coup. He states that its covert support was crucial to engineering the coup, as well as for the consolidation of power by the Pinochet regime following the takeover. Winn documents an extensive CIA operation to fabricate reports of a coup against Allende, as justification for the imposition of military rule.&#91;9&#93; Peter Kornbluh asserts that the CIA destabilized Chile and helped create the conditions for the coup, citing documents declassified by the Clinton administration.&#91;48&#93; Other authors point to the involvement of the Defense Intelligence Agency, agents of which allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard the La Moneda Palace.&#91;49&#93;
The U.S. Government's hostility to the election of Allende in 1970 in Chile was substantiated in documents declassified during the Clinton administration, which show that CIA covert operatives were inserted in Chile in order to prevent a Marxist government from arising and for the purpose of spreading anti-Allende propaganda.&#91;50&#93; As described in the Church Committee report, the CIA was involved in multiple plots designed to remove Allende and then let the Chileans vote in a new election where he would not be a candidate. The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the Track I approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the 40 Committee, attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections. This approach completely failed in 1970 and was not attempted again.
The other approach of the CIA in 1970 (but not later), also known as the Track II approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup by creating a climate of crisis across the country. False flag operatives contacted senior Chilean military officers and informed them that the U.S. would actively support a coup, but would revoke all military aid if such a coup did not happen.&#91;48&#93; In addition, the CIA gave extensive support for black propaganda against Allende, channeled mostly through El Mercurio. Financial assistance was also given to Allende's political opponents, and for organizing strikes and unrest to destabilize the government. By 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company ITT Corporation owned 70% of Chitelco (the Chilean Telephone Company), and also funded El Mercurio. The CIA used ITT as a means of disguising the source of the illegitimate funding Allende's opponents received.&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93; Years later on 28 September 1973, unknown bombers bombed ITT's headquarters in New York City, supposedly in retaliation.&#91;54&#93;
An Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) station was established in Chile at the Australian embassy in July 1971 at the request of the CIA and authorised by then Liberal Party Foreign Minister William McMahon. Newly-elected Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was informed of the operation in February 1973 and signed a document ordering the closure of the operation several weeks later. It appears, however, the last ASIS agent did not leave Chile until October 1973, one month after the coup d'état had brought down the Allende Government. There were also two officers of Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), Australia's internal security service, who were based in Santiago working as migration officers during this period.&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93; The failure of timely closure of Australia's covert operations was one of the reasons for the sacking of the Director of ASIS on 21 October 1975. This took effect on 7 November, just four days before Prime Minister's Whitlam's own dismissal in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis with allegations of CIA political interference.&#91;57&#93;
By 7:00 ;am on 11 September 1973, a date chosen to match the historical coup of 12 September 1924, the Navy captured Valparaíso, strategically stationing ships and marine infantry in the central coast and closed radio and television networks. The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy's actions; immediately, the president went to the presidential palace with his bodyguards, the "Group of Personal Friends" (GAP). By 8:00 ;am, the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city; the Air Force bombed the remaining active stations; the President received incomplete information, and was convinced that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.
President Allende and Defence minister Orlando Letelier were unable to communicate with military leaders. Admiral Montero, the Navy's commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut and his cars were sabotaged before the coup d’état, to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to José Toribio Merino, planner of the coup d’état and executive officer to Adm. Montero. Augusto Pinochet, General of the Army, and Gustavo Leigh, General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende's telephone calls to them. The General Director of the Carabineros (uniformed police), José María Sepúlveda, and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), Alfredo Joignant answered Allende's calls and immediately went to the La Moneda presidential palace. When Defence minister Letelier arrived at the Ministry of Defense, controlled by Adm. Patricio Carvajal, he was arrested as the first prisoner of the coup d’état.
Despite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet's loyalty, telling a reporter that the coup d’état leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30 ;am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military's rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.
Leigh ordered the presidential palace bombed, but was told the Air Force's Hawker Hunter jet aircraft would take forty minutes to arrive. Pinochet ordered an armoured and infantry force under General Sergio Arellano to advance upon the La Moneda presidential palace. When the troops moved forward, they were forced to retreat after coming under fire from GAP snipers perched on rooftops. General Arellano called for helicopter gunship support from the commander of the Chilean Army Puma helicopter squadron and the troops were able to advance again.&#91;60&#93; Chilean Air Force aircraft soon arrived to provide close air support for the assault (by bombing the Palace), but the defenders did not surrender until nearly 2:30 ;pm.&#91;61&#93; First reports said the 65-year-old president had died fighting troops, but later police sources reported he had committed suicide.
In the first months after the coup d’état, the military killed thousands of Chilean leftists, both real and suspected, or forced their "disappearance". The military imprisoned 40,000 political enemies in the National Stadium of Chile; among the tortured and killed desaparecidos (disappeared) were the U.S. citizens Charles Horman, and Frank Teruggi.&#91;62&#93; In October 1973, the Chilean songwriter Víctor Jara was murdered, along with 70 other people in a series of killings perpetrated by the death squad Caravan of Death (Caravana de la Muerte).
The government arrested some 130,000 people in a three-year period;&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93; the dead and disappeared numbered thousands in the first months of the military government. Those include the British physician Sheila Cassidy, who survived to publicize to the UK the human rights violations in Chile.&#91;65&#93; Among those detained was Alberto Bachelet (father of future Chilean President Michelle Bachelet), an Air Force official; he was tortured and died on 12 March 1974,&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93; the right-wing newspaper, El Mercurio,&#91;69&#93; reported that Mr Bachelet died after a basketball game, citing his poor cardiac health. Michelle Bachelet and her mother were imprisoned and tortured in the Villa Grimaldi detention and torture centre on 10 January 1975.&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93;
According to official reports prepared after the return of democracy, at La Moneda only two people died: President Allende and the journalist Augusto Olivares (both by suicide). Two more were injured, Antonio Aguirre and Osvaldo Ramos, both members of President Allende's entourage; they would later be allegedly kidnapped from the hospital and disappeared. In November 2006, the Associated Press noted that more than 15 bodyguards and aides were taken from the palace during the coup and are still unaccounted for; in 2006 Augusto Pinochet was indicted for two of their deaths.&#91;77&#93;
On the military side, there were 34 deaths: two army sergeants, three army corporals, four army privates, 2 navy lieutenants, 1 navy corporal, 4 naval cadets, 3 navy conscripts and 15 carabineros.&#91;78&#93; In mid-September, the Chilean military junta claimed its troops suffered another 16 dead and 100 injured by gunfire in mopping-up operations against Allende supporters, and Pinochet said: "sadly there are still some armed groups who insist on attacking, which means that the military rules of wartime apply to them."&#91;79&#93; A press photographer also died in the crossfire while attempting to cover the event. On 23 October 1973, 23-year-old army corporal Benjamín Alfredo Jaramillo Ruz, who was serving with the Cazadores, became the first fatal casualty of the counterinsurgency operations in the mountainous area of Alquihue in Valdivia after being shot by a sniper.&#91;80&#93; The Chilean Army suffered 12 killed in various clashes with MIR guerrillas and GAP fighters in October 1973.&#91;81&#93;
While fatalities in the battle during the coup might have been relatively small, the Chilean security forces sustained 162 dead in the three following months as a result of continued resistance,&#91;82&#93; and tens of thousands of people were arrested during the coup and held in the National Stadium.&#91;83&#93; This was because the plans for the coup called for the arrest of every man, woman and child on the streets the morning of 11 September. Of these approximately 40,000 to 50,000 perfunctory arrests, several hundred individuals would later be detained, questioned, tortured, and in some cases murdered.&#91;citation needed&#93; While these deaths did not occur before the surrender of Allende's forces, they occurred as a direct result of arrests and round-ups during the coup's military action.
President Allende died in La Moneda during the coup. The junta officially declared that he committed suicide with a rifle given to him by Fidel Castro, two doctors from the infirmary of La Moneda stated that they witnessed the suicide,&#91;84&#93; and an autopsy labelled Allende's death a suicide. Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, one of the primary instigators of the coup, claimed that "Allende committed suicide and is dead now."&#91;This quote needs a citation&#93; Patricio Guijon, one of the president's doctors, had testified to witnessing Allende shoot himself under the chin with the rifle while seated on a sofa.&#91;85&#93;
At the time, few of Allende's supporters believed the explanation that Allende had killed himself.&#91;86&#93; Allende's body was exhumed in May 2011. The exhumation was requested by members of the Allende family, including his daughter Isabel who viewed the question of her father's death as "an insult to scientific intelligence." A scientific autopsy was performed and the autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding on 19 July 2011 that Allende committed suicide using an AK-47 rifle.&#91;87&#93; The team was composed of international forensic experts to assure an independent evaluation.
However, on 31 May 2011, Chile's state television station reported that a top-secret military account of Allende's death had been discovered in the home of a former military justice official. The 300-page document was only found when the house was destroyed in the 2010 Chilean earthquake. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told Televisión Nacional de Chile "that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated."&#91;88&#93; Two forensics experts said they believed he was shot with a small-calibre weapon prior to the AK-47. One expert, Luis Ravanal, noted the lack of blood on his collar, sweater and throat suggested someone else fired the AK-47 when he was already dead.&#91;89&#93;
Allende's widow and family escaped the military government and were accepted for exile in Mexico, where they remained for 17 years.&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93;
On 13 September, the Junta dissolved Congress,&#91;92&#93; outlawed the parties that had been part of the Popular Unity coalition, and all political activity was declared "in recess".&#91;93&#93; The military government took control of all media, including the radio broadcasting that Allende attempted to use to give his final speech to the nation. It is not known how many Chileans actually heard the last words of Allende as he spoke them, but a transcript and audio of the speech survived the military government.&#91;94&#93;&#91;95&#93; Chilean scholar Lidia M. Baltra details how the military took control of the media platforms and turned them into their own "propaganda machine."&#91;95&#93; The only two newspapers that were allowed to continue publishing after the military takeover were El Mercurio and La Tercera de la Hora, both of which were anti-Allende under his leadership.&#91;95&#93; The dictatorship's silencing of the leftist point of view extended past the media and into "every discourse that expressed any resistance to the regime."&#91;96&#93; An example of this is the torturing and death of folk singer Victor Jara. The military government detained Jara in the days following the coup. He, along with many other leftists, was held in Estadio Nacional, or the National Stadium of Chile in the capital of Santiago. Initially, the Junta tried to silence him by crushing his hands, but ultimately he was murdered.&#91;97&#93; Immediately after the coup the military sought television host Don Francisco to have him report on the events. Don Francisco declined the offer, encouraging the captain that had approached him to take the role of reporter himself.&#91;98&#93;
Initially, there were four leaders of the junta: In addition to General Augusto Pinochet, from the Army, there were General Gustavo Leigh Guzmán, of the Air Force; Admiral José Toribio Merino Castro, of the Navy (who replaced Constitutionalist Admiral Raúl Montero); and General Director César Mendoza Durán, of the National Police (Carabineros de Chile) (who replaced Constitutionalist General Director José María Sepúlveda). Coup leaders soon decided against a rotating presidency and named General Pinochet permanent head of the junta.&#91;99&#93;
In the months that followed the coup, the junta, with authoring work by historian Gonzalo Vial and admiral Patricio Carvajal, published a book titled El Libro Blanco del cambio de gobierno en Chile (commonly known as El Libro Blanco, "The White Book of the Change of Government in Chile"), where they attempted to justify the coup by claiming that they were in fact anticipating a self-coup (the alleged Plan Zeta, or Plan Z) that Allende's government or its associates were purportedly preparing. Historian Peter Winn states that the Central Intelligence Agency had an extensive part to play in fabricating the conspiracy and in selling it to the press, both in Chile and internationally.&#91;9&#93; Although later discredited and officially recognized as the product of political propaganda,&#91;100&#93; Gonzalo Vial has pointed to the similarities between the alleged Plan Z and other existing paramilitary plans of the Popular Unity parties in support of its legitimacy.&#91;101&#93;
One of the first measures of the dictatorship was to set up a Secretaría Nacional de la Juventud (SNJ, National Youth Office). This was done on 28 October 1973, even before the Declaration of Principles of the junta made in March 1974. This was a way of mobilizing sympathetic elements of the civil society in support for the dictatorship.&#91;102&#93;
The newspaper La Tercera published on its front page a photograph showing prisoners at the Quiriquina Island Camp who had been captured during the fighting in Concepción. The photograph's caption stated that some of the detained were local leaders of the "Unidad Popular" while others were "extremists who had attacked the armed forces with firearms". The photo is reproduced in Docuscanner.&#91;103&#93; This is consistent with reports in newspapers and broadcasts in Concepción about the activities of the Armed Forces, which mentioned clashes with "extremists" on several occasions from 11 to 14 September. Nocturnal skirmishes took place around the Hotel Alonso de Ercilla in Colo Colo and San Martín Street, one block away from the Army and military police administrative headquarters. A recently published testimony about the clashes in Concepcion offers several plausible explanations for the reticence of witnesses to these actions.&#91;104&#93;
Besides political leaders and participants, the coup also affected many everyday Chilean citizens.  Thousands were killed, went missing, and were injured.  Because of the political instability in their country, many relocated elsewhere.  Canada, among other countries, became a main point of refuge for many Chilean citizens.  Through an operation known as "Special Movement Chile", more than 7,000 Chileans were relocated to Canada in the months following 11 September 1973.&#91;105&#93; These refugees are now known as Chilean Canadian people and have a population of over 38,000.&#91;106&#93;
The U.S. view of the coup continues to spark controversy. Beginning in late 2014 in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS), located at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints included that the Center knowingly protected a CHDS professor from Chile who was a former top advisor to Pinochet after belonging to the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional / DINA state terrorist organization (whose attack against a former Chilean foreign minister in 1976 in Washington, D.C. resulted in two deaths, including that of an American). "Reports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extra-judicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive", said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the author of the "Leahy Law" prohibiting U.S. assistance to military units and members of foreign security forces that violate human rights.&#91;107&#93;&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93;
Roberto Thieme, the military leader of Fatherland and Liberty, who was imprisoned on 11 September was shocked to hear about the degree of violence the coup was carried out with. Despite being an arduous opponent of Unidad Popular he had expected a cleaner coup.&#91;111&#93;
President of Argentina Juan Domingo Perón condemned the coup calling it a "fatality for the continent". Before the coup Perón had warned the more radical of his followers to stay calm and "not do as Allende".&#91;112&#93; Argentine students protested the coup at the Chilean embassy in Buenos Aires, where part of them chanted that they were "available to cross the Andes" (dispuestos a cruzar la cordillera).&#91;113&#93;
The commemoration of the coup is associated to competing narratives on its cause and effects.&#91;114&#93; The coup has been commemorated by detractors and supporters in various ways.
On 11 September 1975 Pinochet lit the Llama de la Libertad (lit. Flame of Liberty) to commemorate the coup. This flame was extinguished in 2004.&#91;115&#93;&#91;116&#93; Avenida Nueva Providencia in Providencia, Santiago, was renamed Avenida 11 de Septiembre in 1980.&#91;117&#93; In the 30th anniversary of the coup President Ricardo Lagos inaugurated the Morandé 80 entrance to La Moneda. This entrance to the presidential palace had been erased during the repairs the dictatorship did to the building after the bombing.&#91;118&#93;
The 40th anniversary of the coup in 2013 was particularly intense.&#91;114&#93; That year the name of Avenida 11 de Septiembre was reversed to the original Avenida Nueva Providencia.&#91;117&#93; The Association of Chilean Magistrates issued a public statement in early September 2013 recognizing the past unwillingness of judges to protect those persecuted by dictatorship.&#91;114&#93; On 11 September 2013 hundreds of Chileans posed as dead in the streets of Santiago in remembrance of the ones "disappeared" by the dictatorship.&#91;119&#93;
The centre-left opposition refused to attend the commemoration event organized by Sebastián Piñera's right-wing government organizing instead a separate event.&#91;119&#93; Osvaldo Andrade of the Socialist Party explained that attendance was not viable as Piñera's government was "packed with passive accomplices" of the dictatorship.&#91;120&#93; Some right-wing politicians also declined the invitation.&#91;121&#93; Presidential candidate Michelle Bachelet planned to spend the day visiting Museum of Memory and Human Rights and commented that "it is not fair to talk about the coup as something unavoidable".&#91;121&#93; President Piñera held an unusual speech in which he denounced "passive accomplices" like news reporters who deliberately changed or omitted the truth and judges who rejected recursos de amparos that could have saved lives. People who knew things or could have known things but decided to stay quiet were also criticized as passive accomplices in Piñera's speech.&#91;114&#93;
A number of new films, theatre plays, and photography expositions were held to cast light on the abuses and censorship of the dictatorship.&#91;119&#93; The number of new books published on the subject in 2013 was such that it constituted an editorial boom.&#91;114&#93;&#91;119&#93; The Museum of Memory and Human Rights also displayed a collection of declassified CIA, FBI, Defense Department, and White House records illustrating the U.S. role in the dictatorship and the coup.&#91;122&#93; Conferences and seminaries on the subject of coup were also held. Various series and interviews with politicians on the subject of the coup and the dictatorship were aired on Chilean TV in 2013.&#91;114&#93;


José Toribio Merino Castro (December 14, 1915 &#8211; August 30, 1996) was a Chilean admiral who was one of the principal leaders of the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, along with General Augusto Pinochet of the Army, General Gustavo Leigh of the Air Force, and General César Mendoza of the Carabineros (national police). Together they established a military government that ruled Chile from 1973 until 1990.
During the dictatorship held short improvised press conferences on tuesday that came to be called martes de Merino (Merino's tuesdays). These conferences gained notoriety by Merino's recurrent use of dark humor in addition to his "constant errors and aberrations".&#91;1&#93;  
Born in La Serena, he was son of Vice Admiral José Toribio Merino Saavedra, Navy Inspector General, and of Bertina Castro Varela. He entered the Naval Academy in 1931, graduating in 1936 as a midshipman. During World War II he served in the US Navy on the USS ;Raleigh until 1945. After World War II he served in different units of the Chilean Navy such as: Destructor Serrano (2do), Crucero O'Higgins (4to) (CL02), Corbeta Papudo(1º), Transporte Angamos (3ro)
Between 1955 and 1957 he served as aide and counsel in weaponry to the Chilean embassy in London. During the construction of the Almirante-class destroyers Williams and Riveros. In 1960, he was assigned as a teacher at the Naval War Academy (AGN) teaching Logistics, Geopolitics, Geostrategy. In 1969 he became Naval Director of Weapons. In January 1970 he was appointed as Director of Navy Services, and in November of the same year he assumed the command of the Chilean main combat fleet (CJE).
After the military coup that ousted socialist President Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973, a military junta was formed to govern the country, and Merino was named commander-in-chief of the Chilean Navy.  General Pinochet was soon named as the chairman of the ruling junta, as he was head of the army, the oldest branch of the Chilean military. As the navy was the second oldest branch, Merino was vice-chairman and second-in-command to Pinochet.
As the second in command and also as member of the Governing Junta he was in charge of the economic sector of the country and presided over the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, where the economic measures were born. In addition, all the decrees were elaborated and the laws on the matters had to dictate to regulate the economic sector.
From the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers, he impelled, the first economic measures of the Military Government, the liberation of prices of goods and services; the fiscal cost was reduced and the interest rates were freed to give birth to  capital markets ;; the companies of the State were reorganized as well, standardizing them.
By the end of 1974, he represented the Government and State of Chile before the Spanish Government, to renegotiate contracts that appeared unfavorable to Chile. Specially, the Pegaso contract renegotiated, successfully. The study of the Statute for foreign investors was initiative of Admiral Merino. He impelled the study and the decree law of exporter promotion of Chile, which gave origin to PROCHILE. In 1975 he participated in the Statute of the Governing Junta, the Legislative Commissions and the Secretariat of Legislation were created.
Admiral Merino presided over the First Legislative Commission after a law established the organization of the junta was enacted on  1974 which made the ruling junta the legislative power of the country and vested formally Pinochet the executive power as the self-proclaimed new President of Chile. Under Merino's leadership, the junta as the Legislative Commission first legislated mainly for the economic sectors and of Foreign Relations, and soon, the Fourth Legislative Commission of the junta enacted laws for the Defense Sector.  In this period impulse the Decree Law to discount the forestation, settling down incentives to develop the plantations of this nature in the country. Again it represented the Government of Chile before the United States Government and one met with President Jimmy Carter. With great sense of social justice, Law N 3,480, allowed to indebted of the System of Saving and the Loan Houses to re-pact its debts, which came to favour of workers of the medium class sector.
During the conflict with Argentina over the Beagle Channel, Merino was one of the most belligerent junta members. He only reluctantly accepted Pope John Paul II's peace proposal, telling him, "I only signed the treaty because I'm Catholic and I respect Your Holiness. If I weren't, I wouldn't have signed it." Also, he ordered the commander of the surface fleet "go there... and win the war".
In 1980 law N 3,500 was dictated to the decree that created the new provisional system. Admiral Merino was a great defender of this legislation, giving his approval and endorsement during the study and discussion of this matter. He was the main legislative person in charge of the materialization. When in 1980 the new constitution was approved, Admiral Merino presided over the Governing Junta. This constituted the legislative power legitimized by the constitution and remained in effect until March 1990, when democratic government was restored. In addition the admiral presided over the fifth  Legislative Commission of the junta.
During this period he impelled the initiative of the Law of promotion to the Merchant Marine, remarkably contributing to the growth of this sector and also to the sector of shipyards and naval industry through the Law N 18.454. He presented the relative motions to replace the Code of Commerce; to adapt the Chilean marine limits to the Convention of Jamaica, by means of the corresponding reform to the Civil Code, and to countermand the legislation that allowed the therapeutic abortion, everything which was approved by means of the corresponding laws dictated in that period.
Also, he impelled all the Constitutional Statutory laws, which allowed the Military Government to fulfill the constitutional itinerary and delivery the power to the civil elected authority. In 1989 he proposed to the Executive authority the law of Fishing and Agriculture, which was obtained after a great discussion in the sector. Its aim was to put the conditions for the conservation of renewable the marine resources.
Finally, it corresponded to him to preside over the Joint Legislative Commission destined to reform the Political Constitution, whose text, approved by the Governing Junta, was ratified by the conducted plebiscite the 30 of June 1989. During the period of government of the FF.AA., under his  tuition 3,660 Decrees were promulgated Laws and 1,090 Laws that take his signature. But Pinochet as the president of the country has the final authority to ratify and implement such laws passed by the junta and approved by Merino. He retired from the navy as its commander in chief on the 8 of March 1990, after more than 50 years of service. He was also the President of the Government Junta of Chile, the de facto Vice-President of the country from March 11, 1981 until his resignation on March 8, 1990.
The Chilean Navy in honour of the Admiral named after him the BMS ;Almirante Merino. This ship is the main surface logistic platform for the submarine force.

Salvador Guillermo Allende Gossens (US: /ɑːˈjɛndeɪ, -di/,&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93; UK: /æˈ-, aɪˈɛn-/,&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; American Spanish: ;[salβaˈðoɾ ɣiˈʝeɾmo aˈʝende ˈɣosens]; 26 June 1908 – 11 September 1973) was a Chilean socialist&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; politician and physician, President of Chile from 1970 until 1973, and head of the Popular Unity political coalition government; he was Latin America's first ever Marxist to be elected president in a country with liberal democracy.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;
Allende's involvement in Chilean political life spanned a period of nearly forty years, having covered the posts of senator, deputy and cabinet minister. As a life-long committed member of the Socialist Party of Chile, whose foundation he had actively contributed to, he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections. In 1970, he won the presidency in a close three-way race. He was elected in a run-off by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority.
As president, Allende sought to nationalize major industries, expand education and improve the living standards of the working class. He clashed with the right-wing parties that controlled Congress and with the judiciary. On 11 September 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'état supported by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93;&#91;13&#93; As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign.&#91;14&#93; Later that day, Allende died of suicide with a gun,&#91;15&#93; according to an investigation conducted by a Chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011.&#91;16&#93;
Following Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990, ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance. The military junta that took over dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.&#91;17&#93;
Allende was born on 26 June 1908&#91;18&#93; in Santiago.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; He was the son of Salvador Allende Castro and Laura Gossens Uribe. Allende's family belonged to the Chilean upper middle class and had a long tradition of political involvement in progressive and liberal causes. His grandfather was a prominent physician and a social reformist who founded one of the first secular schools in Chile.&#91;21&#93; Salvador Allende was of Basque&#91;22&#93; and Belgian (Walloons)&#91;23&#93; descent.
Allende attended high school at Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera of Santiago and at the Liceo Eduardo de la Barra in Valparaíso. As a teenager, his main intellectual and political influence came from the shoe-maker Juan De Marchi, an Italian-born anarchist.&#91;21&#93; Allende was a talented athlete in his youth, being a member of the Everton de Viña del Mar sports club (named after the more famous English football club of the same name), where he is said to have excelled at the long jump.&#91;24&#93; Allende then graduated with a medical degree in 1933 from the University of Chile.&#91;21&#93; During his time at medical school Allende was influenced by Professor Max Westenhofer, a German pathologist who emphasized the social determinants of disease and social medicine.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;
Allende co-founded a section of the Socialist Party of Chile (founded in 1933 with Marmaduque Grove and others) in Valparaíso&#91;21&#93; and became its chairman. He married Hortensia Bussi with whom he had three daughters. He was a Freemason, a member of the Lodge Progreso No. 4 in Valparaíso.&#91;27&#93; In 1933, he published his doctoral thesis Higiene Mental y Delincuencia (Crime and Mental Hygiene) in which he criticized Cesare Lombroso's proposals.&#91;28&#93;
In 1938, Allende was in charge of the electoral campaign of the Popular Front headed by Pedro Aguirre Cerda.&#91;21&#93; The Popular Front's slogan was "Bread, a Roof and Work!"&#91;21&#93; After its electoral victory, he became Minister of Health in the Reformist Popular Front government which was dominated by the Radicals.&#91;21&#93; While serving in this position, Allende was responsible for the passage of a wide range of progressive social reforms, including safety laws protecting workers in the factories, higher pensions for widows, maternity care, and free lunch programmes for schoolchildren.&#91;29&#93;
Upon entering the government, Allende relinquished his congressional seat for Valparaíso, which he had won in 1937. Around that time, he wrote La Realidad Médico Social de Chile (The social and medical reality of Chile). After the Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany, Allende was one of 76 members of the Congress who sent a telegram to Adolf Hitler denouncing the persecution of Jews.&#91;30&#93; Following President Aguirre Cerda's death in 1941, he was again elected deputy while the Popular Front was renamed Democratic Alliance.
In 1945, Allende became senator for the Valdivia, Llanquihue, Chiloé, Aisén and Magallanes provinces; then for Tarapacá and Antofagasta in 1953; for Aconcagua and Valparaíso in 1961; and once more for Chiloé, Aisén and Magallanes in 1969. He became president of the Chilean Senate in 1966. During the Fifties, Allende introduced legislation that established the Chilean national health service, the first program in the Americas to guarantee universal health care.&#91;31&#93;
His three unsuccessful bids for the presidency (in the 1952, 1958 and 1964 elections) prompted Allende to joke that his epitaph would be "Here lies the next President of Chile." In 1952, as candidate for the Frente de Acción Popular (Popular Action Front, FRAP), he obtained only 5.4% of the votes, partly due to a division within socialist ranks over support for Carlos Ibáñez. In 1958, again as the FRAP candidate, Allende obtained 28.5% of the vote. This time, his defeat was attributed to votes lost to the populist Antonio Zamorano.
Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the CIA spent a total of $2.6 ;million to finance the campaign of Eduardo Frei and spent $3 ;million in anti-Allende propaganda "to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition". The CIA considered its role in the victory of Frei a great success.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93; They argued that "the financial and organizational assistance given to Frei, the effort to keep Durán in the race, the propaganda campaign to denigrate Allende—were 'indispensable ingredients of Frei's success'", and they thought that his chances of winning and the good progress of his campaign would have been doubtful without the covert support of the Government of the United States.&#91;34&#93; Thus, in 1964 Allende lost once more as the FRAP candidate, polling 38.6% of the votes against 55.6% for Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei. As it became clear that the election would be a race between Allende and Frei, the political right ;&#8211;&#32;which initially had backed Radical Julio Durán– settled for Frei as "the lesser evil".
Allende had a close relationship with the Chilean Communist Party from the beginning of his political career. On his fourth (and successful) bid for the presidency, the Communist Party supported him as the alternate for its own candidate, the world-renowned poet Pablo Neruda.
During his presidential term, Allende shared positions held by the Communists, in opposition to the views of the socialists. Some argue, however, that this was reversed at the end of his period in office.&#91;35&#93;&#91;A&#93;
Allende won the 1970 Chilean presidential election as leader of the Unidad Popular ("Popular Unity") coalition. On 4 September 1970, he obtained a narrow plurality of 36.2% to 34.9% over Jorge Alessandri, a former president, with 27.8% going to a third candidate (Radomiro Tomic) of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). According to the Chilean Constitution of the time, if no presidential candidate obtained a majority of the popular vote, Congress would choose one of the two candidates with the highest number of votes as the winner. Tradition was for Congress to vote for the candidate with the highest popular vote, regardless of margin. Indeed, former president Jorge Alessandri had been elected in 1958 with only 31.6% of the popular vote, defeating Allende.
One month after the election, on 20 October, while the Senate had still to reach a decision and negotiations were actively in place between the Christian Democrats and the Popular Unity, General René Schneider, Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, was shot resisting a kidnap attempt by a group led by General Roberto Viaux. Hospitalized, he died of his wounds three days later, on 23 October. Schneider was a defender of the "constitutionalist" doctrine that the army's role is exclusively professional, its mission being to protect the country's sovereignty and not to interfere in politics.
General Schneider's death was widely disapproved of and, for the time, ended military opposition to Allende,&#91;37&#93; whom the Congress finally chose on 24 October. On 26 October, President Eduardo Frei named General Carlos Prats as commander in chief of the army to replace René Schneider.
Allende assumed the Presidency on 3 November 1970 after signing a Statute of Constitutional Guarantees proposed by the Christian Democrats in return for their support in Congress. In an extensive interview with Régis Debray in 1972, Allende explained his reasons for agreeing to the guarantees.&#91;38&#93; Some critics have interpreted Allende's responses as an admission that signing the Statute was only a tactical move.&#91;39&#93;
Upon assuming the presidency, Allende began to carry out his platform of implementing a socialist programme called La vía chilena al socialismo ("the Chilean Path to Socialism"). This included nationalization of large-scale industries (notably copper mining and banking), and government administration of the health care system, educational system (with the help of a United States educator, Jane A. Hobson-Gonzalez from Kokomo, Indiana), a programme of free milk for children in the schools and shanty towns of Chile, and an expansion of the land seizure and redistribution already begun under his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva,&#91;40&#93; who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the properties listed for takeover.&#91;41&#93; Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens;&#91;42&#93; a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalized enterprises or on public work projects.&#91;42&#93;
In November 1970, 3,000 scholarships were allocated to Mapuche children in an effort to integrate the indigenous minority into the educational system, payment of pensions and grants was resumed, an emergency plan providing for the construction of 120,000 residential buildings was launched, all part-time workers were granted rights to social security, a proposed electricity price increase was withdrawn, diplomatic relations were restored with Cuba, and political prisoners were granted an amnesty. In December that same year, bread prices were fixed, 55,000 volunteers were sent to the south of the country to teach writing and reading skills and provide medical attention to a sector of the population that had previously been ignored, a central commission was established to oversee a tri-partite payment plan in which equal place was given to government, employees and employers, and a protocol agreement was signed with the United Centre of Workers which granted workers representational rights on the funding board of the Social Planning Ministry.&#91;43&#93; An obligatory minimum wage for workers of all ages (including apprentices) was established,&#91;44&#93; free milk was introduced for expectant and nursing mothers and for  children between the ages of 7 and 14,&#91;45&#93; free school meals were established,&#91;46&#93; rent reductions were carried out, and the construction of the Santiago subway was rescheduled so as to serve working-class neighbourhoods first. Workers benefited from increases in social security payments, an expanded public works program, and a modification of the wage and salary adjustment mechanism (which had originally been introduced in the 1940s to cope with the country's permanent inflation), while middle-class Chileans benefited from the elimination of taxes on modest incomes and property.&#91;47&#93; In addition, state-sponsored programs distributed free food to the country's neediest citizens,&#91;48&#93; and in the countryside, peasant councils were established to mobilise agrarian workers and small proprietors. In the government's first budget (presented to the Chilean congress in November 1970), the minimum taxable income level was raised, removing from the tax pool 35% of those who had paid taxes on earnings in the previous year. In addition, the exemption from general taxation was raised to a level equivalent to twice the minimum wage. Exemptions from capital taxes were also extended, which benefitted 330,000 small proprietors. The extra increases that Frei promised to the armed forces were also fully paid. According to one estimate, purchasing power went up by 28% between October 1970 and July 1971.&#91;49&#93;
The rate of inflation fell from 36.1% in 1970 to 22.1% in 1971, while average real wages rose by 22.3% during 1971.&#91;B&#93;&#91;50&#93; Minimum real wages for blue-collar workers were increased by 56% during the first quarter of 1971, while in the same period real minimum wages for white-collar workers were increased by 23%, a development that decreased the differential ratio between blue- and white-collar workers’ minimum wage from 49% (1970) to 35% (1971). Central government expenditures went up by 36% in real terms, raising the share of fiscal spending in GDP from 21% (1970) to 27% (1971), and as part of this expansion, the public sector engaged in a huge housing program, starting to build 76,000 houses in 1971, compared to 24,000 for 1970.&#91;50&#93; During a 1971 emergency program, over 89,000 houses were built, and during Allende's three years as president an average of 52,000 houses were constructed annually.&#91;51&#93; Although the acceleration of inflation in 1972 and 1973 eroded part of the initial increase in wages, they still rose (on average) in real terms during the 1971–73 period.&#91;52&#93;
Allende's first step in early 1971 was to raise minimum wages (in real terms) for blue-collar workers by 37%–41% and 8%–10% for white-collar workers. Educational, food, and housing assistance was significantly expanded, with public-housing starts going up twelvefold and eligibility for free milk extended from age 6 to age 15. A year later, blue-collar wages were raised by 27% in real terms and white-collar wages became fully indexed.&#91;53&#93; Price controls were also set up, while the Allende Government introduced a system of distribution networks through various agencies (including local committees on supply and prices) to ensure that the new rules were adhered to by shopkeepers.&#91;54&#93;
The new Minister of Agriculture, Jacques Chonchol, promised to expropriate all estates which were larger than eighty "basic" hectares (about 200 acres). This promise was kept, with no farm in Chile exceeding this limit by the end of 1972.&#91;55&#93; Within eighteen months, the Latifundia (extensive agricultural estates) had been abolished. The agrarian reform had involved the expropriation of 3,479 properties which, added to the 1,408 properties incorporated under the Frei Government, made up some 40% of the total agricultural land area in the country.&#91;49&#93;
Particularly in rural areas, the Allende Government launched a campaign against illiteracy, while adult education programs expanded, together with educational opportunities for workers. From 1971 through to 1973, enrollments in kindergarten, primary, secondary, and postsecondary schools all increased. The Allende Government encouraged more doctors to begin their practices in rural and low-income urban areas, and built additional hospitals, maternity clinics, and especially neighborhood health centers that remained open longer hours to serve the poor. Improved sanitation and housing facilities for low-income neighborhoods also equalized health care benefits, while hospital councils and local health councils were established in neighborhood health centers as a means of democratizing the administration of health policies. These councils gave central government civil servants, local government officials, health service employees, and community workers the right to review budgetary decisions.&#91;56&#93;
The Allende government also sought to bring the arts (both serious and popular) to the mass of the Chilean population by funding a number of cultural endeavours. With eighteen-year-olds and illiterates now granted the right to vote, mass participation in decision-making was encouraged by the Allende government, with traditional hierarchical structures now challenged by socialist egalitarianism. The Allende Government was able to draw upon the idealism of its supporters, with teams of "Allendistas" travelling into the countryside and shanty towns to perform volunteer work.&#91;55&#93; The Allende Government also worked to transform Chilean popular culture through formal changes to school curriculum and through broader cultural education initiatives, such as state-sponsored music festivals and tours of Chilean folklorists and nueva canción musicians.&#91;57&#93; In 1971, the purchase of a private publishing house by the state gave rise to "Editorial Quimantu", which became the center of the Allende Government's cultural activities. In the space of two years, 12 ;million copies of books, magazines, and documents (8 ;million of which were books) specializing in social analysis, were published. Cheap editions of great literary works were produced on a weekly basis, and in most cases were sold out within a day. Culture came into the reach of the masses for the first time, who responded enthusiastically. "Editorial Quimantu" encouraged the establishment of libraries in community organizations and trade unions. Through the supply of cheap textbooks, it enabled the Left to progress through the ideological content of the literature made available to workers.&#91;49&#93;
To improve social and economic conditions for women, the Women's Secretariat was established in 1971, which took on issues such as public laundry facilities, public food programs, day-care centers, and women's health care (especially prenatal care).&#91;58&#93; The duration of maternity leave was extended from 6 to 12 weeks,&#91;59&#93; while the Allende Government steered the educational system towards poorer Chileans by expanding enrollments through government subsidies.&#91;60&#93; A "democratisation" of university education was carried out, making the system tuition-free. This led to an 89% rise in university enrollments between 1970 and 1973. The Allende Government also increased enrollment in secondary education from 38% in 1970 to 51% in 1974.&#91;61&#93; Enrollment in education reached record levels, including 3.6 ;million young people, and 8 ;million school textbooks were distributed among 2.6 ;million pupils in primary education. An unprecedented 130,000 students were enrolled by the universities, which became accessible to peasants and workers. The illiteracy rate was reduced from 12% in 1970 to 10.8% in 1972, while the growth in primary school enrollment increased from an annual average of 3.4% in the period 1966–70 to 6.5% in 1971–1972. Secondary education grew at a rate of 18.2% in 1971–1972, and the average school enrollment of children between the ages of 6 and 14 rose from 91% (1966–70) to 99%.&#91;49&#93;
Social spending was dramatically increased, particularly for housing, education, and health, while a major effort was made to redistribute wealth to poorer Chileans. As a result of new initiatives in nutrition and health, together with higher wages, many poorer Chileans were able to feed themselves and clothe themselves better than they had been able to before. Public access to the social security system was increased, while state benefits such as family allowances were raised significantly.&#91;55&#93; The redistribution of income enabled wage and salary earners to increase their share of national income from 51.6% (the annual average between 1965 and 1970) to 65% while family consumption increased by 12.9% in the first year of the Allende Government. In addition, while the average annual increase in personal spending had been 4.8% in the period 1965–70, it reached 11.9% in 1971.&#91;49&#93; During the first two years of Allende's presidency, state expenditure on health rose from around 2% to nearly 3.5% of GDP. According to Jennifer E. Pribble, this new spending "was reflected not only in public health campaigns, but also in the construction of health infrastructure".&#91;62&#93; Small programs targeted at women were also experimented with, such as cooperative laundries and communal food preparation, together with an expansion of child-care facilities.&#91;63&#93;
The National Supplementary Food Program was extended to all primary school pupils and to all pregnant women, regardless of their employment or income condition. Complementary nutritional schemes were applied to malnourished children, while antenatal care was emphasized.&#91;64&#93; Under Allende, the proportion of children under the age of 6 with some form of malnutrition fell by 17%.&#91;45&#93; Apart from the existing Supply and Prices councils (community-based bodies which controlled the distribution of essential groups in working-class districts, and were a popular, not government, initiative),&#91;65&#93; community-based distribution centers and shops were developed, which sold directly in working-class neighborhoods. The Allende Government felt obliged to increase its intervention in marketing activities, and state involvement in grocery distribution reached 33%.&#91;49&#93; The CUT (central labor confederation) was accorded legal recognition,&#91;66&#93; and its membership grew from 700,000 to almost 1 ;million. In enterprises in the Area of Social Ownership, an assembly of the workers elected half of the members of the management council for each company. These bodies replaced the former board of directors.&#91;49&#93;
Minimum pensions were increased by amounts equal to two or three times the inflation rate, and between 1970 and 1972, such pensions increased by a total of 550%. The incomes of 300,000 retirement pensioners were increased by the government from one-third of the minimum salary to the full amount. Labor insurance cover was extended to 200,000 market traders, 130,000 small shop proprietors, 30,000 small industrialists, small owners, transport workers, clergy, professional sportsmen, and artesans. The public health service was improved, with the establishment of a system of clinics in working-class neighborhoods on the peripheries of the major cities, providing a health center for every 40,000 inhabitants. Statistics for construction in general, and house-building in particular, reached some of the highest levels in the history of Chile. Four million square metres were completed in 1971–72, compared to an annual average of &#x200b;2 ;1&#8260;2 million between 1965 and 1970. Workers were able to acquire goods which had previously been beyond their reach, such as heaters, refrigerators, and television sets. As further noted by Ricardo Israel Zipper,
"By now meat was no longer a luxury, and the children of working people were adequately supplied with shoes and clothing. The popular living standards were improved in terms of the employment situation, social services, consumption levels, and income distribution."&#91;49&#93;
Chilean presidents were allowed a maximum term of six years, which may explain Allende's haste to restructure the economy. Not only was a major restructuring program organized (the Vuskovic plan), he had to make it a success if a socialist or communist successor to Allende was going to be elected. In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Minister of the Economy Pedro Vuskovic's expansive monetary policy were highly favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). However, by 1972, the Chilean escudo had an inflation rate of 140%. The average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6% ("negative growth"); and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined.&#91;68&#93; The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing, together with the "disappearance" of basic commodities from supermarket shelves, led to the rise of black markets in rice, beans, sugar, and flour.&#91;69&#93; The Chilean economic situation was also somewhat exacerbated due to a US-backed campaign to fund worker strikes in certain sectors of the economy.&#91;70&#93; The Allende government announced it would default on debts owed to international creditors and foreign governments. Allende also froze all prices while raising salaries. His implementation of these policies was strongly opposed by landowners, employers, businessmen and transporters associations, and some civil servants and professional unions. The rightist opposition was led by the National Party, the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of educational policy),&#91;71&#93; and eventually the Christian Democrats. There were growing tensions with foreign multinational corporations and the government of the United States.
Allende also undertook the pioneeristic Project Cybersyn, a distributed decision support system for decentralized economic planning, developed by British cybernetics expert Stafford Beer. Based on the experimental viable system model and the neural network approach to organizational design, the Project consisted of four modules: a network of telex machines (Cybernet) in all state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (Cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in "almost" real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government. The information would also be input into an economic simulation software (CHECO, for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) which featured a Bayesian filtering and control setting that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (Opsroom) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate feasible responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network.&#91;72&#93; In conjunction with the system, the Cybersyn development team also planned the so-called Cyberfolk device system, a closed television circuit connected to an interactive apparatus that would enable the citizenry to actively participate in economic and political decision-making.
In 1971, Chile re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba, joining Mexico and Canada in rejecting a previously established Organization of American States convention prohibiting governments in the Western Hemisphere from establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Shortly afterward, Cuban president Fidel Castro made a month-long visit to Chile. Originally the visit was supposed to be one week; however, Castro enjoyed Chile and one week led to another.
In October 1972, the first of what were to be a wave of strikes was led first by truckers, and later by small businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions and some student groups. Other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to induce Allende to bring the head of the army, general Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister.&#91;69&#93; Allende also instructed the government to begin requisitioning trucks to keep the nation from coming to a halt. Government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and buses but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police protection for the strike-breakers. Allende's actions were eventually declared unlawful by the Chilean appeals court and the government was ordered to return trucks to their owners.&#91;73&#93;
Throughout this presidency racial tensions between the poor descendants of indigenous people, who supported Allende's reforms, and the white elite increased.&#91;74&#93;
Allende raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971, but these wage hikes were negated by the in-tandem inflation of Chile's fiat currency. Although price rises had also been high under Frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. In the period 1970–72, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%.&#91;75&#93;
Export income fell due to a hard-hit copper industry: the price of copper on international markets fell by almost a third, and post-nationalization copper production fell as well. Copper is Chile's single most important export (more than half of Chile's export receipts were from this sole commodity&#91;76&#93;). The price of copper fell from a peak of $66 per ton in 1970 to only $48–9 in 1971 and 1972.&#91;77&#93;  Chile was already dependent on food imports, and this decline in export earnings coincided with declines in domestic food production following Allende's agrarian reforms.&#91;78&#93;
Throughout his presidency, Allende remained at odds with the Chilean Congress, which was dominated by the Christian Democratic Party. The Christian Democrats (who had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections, but drifted away from those positions during Allende's presidency, eventually forming a coalition with the National Party)&#91;citation needed&#93;, continued to accuse Allende of leading Chile toward a Cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies. Allende and his opponents in Congress repeatedly accused each other of undermining the Chilean Constitution and acting undemocratically.
Allende's increasingly bold socialist policies (partly in response to pressure from some of the more radical members within his coalition), combined with his close contacts with Cuba, heightened fears in Washington. The Nixon administration continued exerting economic pressure on Chile via multilateral organizations, and continued to back Allende's opponents in the Chilean Congress. Almost immediately after his election, Nixon directed CIA and U.S. State Department officials to "put pressure" on the Allende government.&#91;79&#93; His economic policies were used by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards to coin the term macroeconomic populism.&#91;80&#93;
In 1972, Chile's inflation was at 150%. ("Pinochet's rule: Repression and economic success". BBC News. 2001-01-07. Retrieved 2010-05-12).
Allende's Popular Unity government tried to maintain normal relations with the United States.  But when Chile nationalized its copper industry, Washington cut off United States credits and increased its support to opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile gained commitments from the Soviet Union to invest some $400 ;million in Chile in the next six years.&#91;citation needed&#93; Allende's government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the USSR than it hoped for. Trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of Soviet equipment. Moreover, credits from the Soviet Union were much less than those provided to the People's Republic of China and countries of Eastern Europe. When Allende visited the USSR in late 1972 in search of more aid and additional lines of credit, after 3 years, he was turned down.&#91;81&#93;
The United States opposition to Allende started several years before he was elected President of Chile. Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the CIA spent $3 ;million in anti-Allende propaganda "to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition", and spent a total of $2.6 ;million to finance the presidential campaign of Eduardo Frei.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93;
The possibility of Allende winning Chile's 1970 election was deemed a disaster by a US administration that wanted to protect US geopolitical interests by preventing the spread of Communism during the Cold War.&#91;82&#93; In September 1970, President Nixon informed the CIA that an Allende government in Chile would not be acceptable and authorized $10 ;million to stop Allende from coming to power or unseat him.&#91;83&#93; A CIA document declared, "It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup."&#91;84&#93; Henry Kissinger's 40 Committee and the CIA planned to impede Allende's investiture as President of Chile with covert efforts known as "Track I" and "Track II"; Track I sought to prevent Allende from assuming power via so-called "parliamentary trickery", while under the Track II initiative, the CIA tried to convince key Chilean military officers to carry out a coup.&#91;83&#93;
Additionally, some point to the involvement of the Defense Intelligence Agency agents that allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard La Moneda Palace.&#91;85&#93; In fact, open US military aid to Chile continued during the Allende administration, and the national government was very much aware of this, although there is no record that Allende himself believed that such assistance was anything but beneficial to Chile.
During Nixon's presidency, United States officials attempted to prevent Allende's election by financing political parties aligned with opposition candidate Jorge Alessandri and supporting strikes in the mining and transportation sectors.&#91;86&#93; After the 1970 election, the Track I operation attempted to incite Chile's outgoing president, Eduardo Frei Montalva, to persuade his party (PDC) to vote in Congress for Alessandri.&#91;87&#93; Under the plan, Alessandri would resign his office immediately after assuming it and call new elections. Eduardo Frei would then be constitutionally able to run again (since the Chilean Constitution did not allow a president to hold two consecutive terms, but allowed multiple non-consecutive ones), and presumably easily defeat Allende. The Chilean Congress instead chose Allende as president, on the condition that he would sign a "Statute of Constitutional Guarantees" affirming that he would respect and obey the Chilean Constitution and that his reforms would not undermine any of its elements.
Track II was aborted, as parallel initiatives already underway within the Chilean military rendered it moot.&#91;88&#93;
During the second term of office of Democratic President Bill Clinton, the CIA acknowledged having played a role in Chilean politics before the coup, but its degree of involvement is debated. The CIA was notified by its Chilean contacts of the impending coup two days in advance but contends it "played no direct role in" the coup.&#91;89&#93;
Much of the internal opposition to Allende's policies came from the business sector, and recently released United States government documents confirm that the United States indirectly&#91;70&#93; funded the truck drivers' strike,&#91;90&#93; which exacerbated the already chaotic economic situation before the coup.
The most prominent United States corporations in Chile before Allende's presidency were the Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies and ITT Corporation, International Telephone and Telegraph. Both copper corporations aimed to expand privatized copper production in the city of Sewell in the Chilean Andes, where the world's largest underground copper mine "El Teniente", was located.&#91;91&#93; At the end of 1968, according to US Department of Commerce data, United States corporate holdings in Chile amounted to $964 ;million. Anaconda and Kennecott accounted for 28% of United States holdings, but ITT had by far the largest holding of any single corporation, with an investment of $200 ;million in Chile.&#91;91&#93; In 1970, before Allende was elected, ITT owned 70% of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company and funded El Mercurio, a Chilean right-wing newspaper. Documents released in 2000 by the CIA confirmed that before the elections of 1970, ITT gave $700,000 to Allende's conservative opponent, Jorge Alessandri, with help from the CIA on how to channel the money safely. ITT president Harold Geneen also offered $1 ;million to the CIA to help defeat Allende in the elections.&#91;92&#93;
After General Pinochet assumed power, United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told President Richard Nixon that the United States "didn't do it", but "we helped them...created the conditions as great as possible". (referring to the coup itself).&#91;93&#93; Recent documents declassified under the Clinton administration's Chile Declassification Project show that the United States government and the CIA sought to overthrow Allende in 1970 immediately before he took office ("Project FUBELT"). Many documents regarding the United States intervention in Chile remain classified.
Political and moral support came mostly through the Communist Party and unions of the Soviet Union. For instance, Allende received the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1972. However, there were some fundamental differences between Allende and Soviet political analysts, who believed that some violence – or measures that those analysts "theoretically considered to be just" – should have been used.&#91;94&#93; Declarations from KGB General Nikolai Leonov, former Deputy Chief of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, confirmed that the Soviet Union supported Allende's government economically, politically and militarily.&#91;94&#93; Leonov stated in an interview at the Chilean Center of Public Studies (CEP) that the Soviet economic support included over $100 ;million in credit, three fishing ships (that distributed 17,000 tons of frozen fish to the population), factories (as help after the 1971 earthquake), 3,100 tractors, 74,000 tons of wheat and more than a million tins of condensed milk.&#91;94&#93;
In mid-1973 the USSR had approved the delivery of weapons (artillery, tanks) to the Chilean Army. However, when news of an attempt from the Army to depose Allende through a coup d'état reached Soviet officials, the shipment was redirected to another country.&#91;94&#93;
Allende is mentioned in a book written by the official historian of the British Intelligence MI5 Christopher Andrew.&#91;95&#93; According to SIS and Andrew, the book is based on the handwritten notes of KGB archivist defector Vasili Mitrokhin.&#91;96&#93; Andrew alleges that the KGB said that Allende "was made to understand the necessity of reorganizing Chile's army and intelligence services, and of setting up a relationship between Chile's and the USSR's intelligence services".&#91;97&#93; The Soviet Union observed closely whether this alternative form of socialism could work, and they did not interfere with the Chileans' decisions. Nikolai Leonov affirms that whenever he tried to give advice to Latin American leaders he was usually turned down by them, and he was told that they had their own understanding on how to conduct political business in their countries. Leonov adds that the relationships of KGB agents with Latin American leaders did not involve intelligence, because their intelligence target was the United States. Since many North Americans were living in the region, they were focusing in recruiting agents from the United States. Latin America was also a better region for KGB agents to get in touch with their informants from the CIA or other contacts from the United States than inside that country.&#91;94&#93;
On 29 June 1973, Colonel Roberto Souper surrounded the presidential palace, La Moneda, with his tank regiment but failed to depose the government.&#91;98&#93; That failed coup d’état – known as the Tanquetazo ("tank putsch") – organised by the nationalist Patria y Libertad paramilitary group, was followed by a general strike at the end of July that included the copper miners of El Teniente.&#91;citation needed&#93;
In August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred, and the Supreme Court of Chile publicly complained about the inability of the Allende government to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats uniting with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts through Allende's refusal to promulgate constitutional amendments, already approved by the Chamber, which would have prevented his government from continuing his massive nationalization plan&#91;99&#93; and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.&#91;100&#93;
For months, Allende had feared calling upon the Carabineros ("Carabineers", the national police force), suspecting them of disloyalty to his government. On 9 August, President Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. On 24 August 1973, General Prats was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the commander-in-chief of the army, embarrassed by both the Alejandrina Cox incident and a public protest in front of his house by the wives of his generals. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.&#91;100&#93;
On 26 May 1973, the Supreme Court of Chile unanimously denounced the Allende government's disruption of the legality of the nation in its failure to uphold judicial decisions, because of its continual refusal to permit police execution of judicial decisions contrary to the government's own measures.
On 22 August 1973, the Christian Democrats and the National Party members of the Chamber of Deputies joined together to vote 81 to 47 in favor of a resolution that asked the authorities to "put an immediate end" to "breach[es of] the Constitution…with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans."
The resolution declared that Allende's government sought "to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State... [with] the goal of establishing... a totalitarian system" and claimed that the government had made "violations of the Constitution... a permanent system of conduct." Essentially, most of the accusations were about disregard by the Socialist government of the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government.
Specifically, the Socialist government of President Allende was accused of:
Finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which were said to be "headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces". President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterized as "notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks".&#91;101&#93;
Two days later, on 24 August 1973, Allende responded, characterising the Congress's declaration as "destined to damage the country's prestige abroad and create internal confusion", predicting "It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors." He noted that the declaration (passed 81–47 in the Chamber of Deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority "constitutionally required" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress were "invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically-elected government" and "subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will."
Allende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a coup d’état or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the (then-current) Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.
Allende wrote: "Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it...With a tranquil conscience...I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside...I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences...Congress has made itself a bastion against the transformations...and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives."
Adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress were obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the State, they sought to destroy it. He concluded by calling upon the workers, all democrats and patriots to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the revolutionary process.
In early September 1973, Allende floated the idea of resolving the constitutional crisis with a plebiscite.&#91;C&#93; His speech outlining such a solution was scheduled for 11 September, but he was never able to deliver it. On 11 September 1973, the Chilean military, aided by the United States and its CIA, staged a coup against Allende.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93;&#91;13&#93;
Just before the capture of La Moneda (the Presidential Palace), with gunfire and explosions clearly audible in the background, Allende gave his farewell speech to Chileans on live radio, speaking of himself in the past tense, of his love for Chile and of his deep faith in its future. He stated that his commitment to Chile did not allow him to take an easy way out, and he would not be used as a propaganda tool by those he called "traitors" (he refused an offer of safe passage), clearly implying he intended to fight to the end.&#91;105&#93;
Shortly afterwards, the coup plotters announced that Allende had committed suicide. An official announcement declared that the weapon he had used was an automatic rifle. Before his death he had been photographed several times holding an AK-47, a gift from Fidel Castro.&#91;106&#93; He was found dead with this gun, according to contemporaneous statements made by officials in the Pinochet regime.
Lingering doubts regarding the manner of Allende's death persisted throughout the period of the Pinochet regime. Many Chileans and independent observers refused to accept on faith the government's version of events amid speculation that Allende had been murdered by government agents.  When in 2011 a Chilean court opened a criminal investigation into the circumstances of Allende's death, Pinochet had long since left power and Chile had meanwhile become one of the most stable democracies in the Americas according to The Economist magazine's democracy index.
The ongoing criminal investigation led to a May 2011 court order that Allende's remains be exhumed and autopsied by an international team of experts.&#91;107&#93; Results of the autopsy were officially released in mid-July 2011. The team of experts concluded that the former president had shot himself with an AK-47 assault rifle.&#91;108&#93; In December 2011 the judge in charge of the investigation affirmed the experts' findings and ruled Allende's death a suicide.&#91;109&#93; On 11 September 2012, the 39th anniversary of Allende's death, a Chilean appeals court unanimously upheld the trial court's ruling, officially closing the case.&#91;110&#93;
The Guardian reported that a scientific autopsy of the remains had confirmed that "Salvador Allende committed suicide during the 1973 coup that toppled his socialist government."&#91;107&#93; It went on to say that: 
According to Isabel Allende Bussi—the daughter of Salvador Allende and currently a member of the Chilean Senate—the Allende family has long accepted that the former president shot himself, telling the BBC that: "The report conclusions are consistent with what we already believed. When faced with extreme circumstances, he made the decision of taking his own life, instead of being humiliated."&#91;111&#93;&#91;112&#93;
The definitive and unanimous results produced by the 2011 Chilean judicial investigation appear to have laid to rest decades of nagging suspicions that Allende might have been assassinated by the Chilean Armed Forces. But public acceptance of the suicide theory had already been growing for much of the previous decade. In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began to tell their stories to the news media and to human rights researchers. The cumulative weight of the facts reported by these witnesses provided factual support for many previously unconfirmed details relating to Allende's death.&#91;113&#93;
The widespread acceptance of suicide as the cause Salvador Allende's death was, however, preceded by decades of speculation and controversializing about the circumstances surrounding his death. Several examples of pre-2011 speculation are shown below or on the Wikipedia page regarding the Death of Salvador Allende.
Alternative views regarding the death of Salvador Allende:
Well-known relatives of Salvador Allende include his daughter Isabel Allende Bussi (a politician) and his first cousin once removed Isabel Allende Llona (a writer).
Memorials to Allende include a statue in front of the Palacio de la Moneda. The placement of the statue was controversial; it was placed facing the eastern edge of the Plaza de la Ciudadanía, a plaza which contains memorials to a number of Chilean statesmen. However, the statue is not located in the plaza, but rather on a surrounding sidewalk facing an entrance to the plaza.
Allende is buried in the general cemetery of Santiago.&#91;116&#93; His tomb is a major tourist attraction.
In Nicaragua, the tourist port of Managua is named after him. The Salvador Allende Port is located near downtown Managua.
The broken glasses of Allende were given to the Chilean National History Museum in 1996 by a woman who had found them in La Moneda in 1973.&#91;117&#93;
A residential street in Toronto has also been named after him.&#91;118&#93;&#91;119&#93;&#91;120&#93;
Allende Avenue in Harlow, Essex, is named after him. There is also a square in the 7th arrondissement of Paris named after him, near the Chilean embassy.
There is a square named after him in Viladecans, near Barcelona, called Plaza de Salvador Allende.
There is a park in Budapest named for Allende.&#91;122&#93;
There is a street in Szekszárd (Hungary) named for Allende.

The Group of Personal Friends (Spanish: Grupo de Amigos Personales), sometimes referred to by the Spanish acronym GAP, was the informal name of an armed unit of the Socialist Party of Chile maintained from 1970 to 1973 for the protection of Salvador Allende. The GAP was trained and equipped by Cuba and initially composed of ex guerrilla fighters. 
The GAP was formed during Salvador Allende's 1970 presidential campaign by Fernando Gómez, a member of the Cuban-trained Bolivian guerrilla group the ELN, at the instigation of Allende's daughter, Beatriz Allende.&#91;2&#93; By the time of the election, the GAP had expanded with the addition of more ex-ELN combatants volunteering to provide security to Allende and, later, members of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR).&#91;2&#93;
Cuba provided technical advisers to assist the GAP, including among them Tony de la Guardia and Patricio de la Guardia.&#91;3&#93;
On one of Allende's first public appearances after his inauguration, a Chilean journalist inquired of the president who the armed men were accompanying him, to which Allende replied "a group of personal friends", giving the group the moniker from which it would thereafter be known.&#91;1&#93; During the 1971 visit of Fidel Castro to Chile, Cuban protection officers brought with them an unusually large arsenal including RPG-7s and AK-47s, leaving almost the entire quantity behind in Chile for the previously pistol-equipped GAP.&#91;1&#93;
Allende came to rely on the GAP as his principal protective force, despite the organization having no formal legal status.&#91;1&#93; GAP leveraged its hybrid status to conduct recce and intelligence-gathering in Chile under the pretense of presidential protection but with information actually being collected for the benefit of MIR paramilitary operations against the political opposition.&#91;1&#93; However, a 1972 operation in Curimon, in which intoxicated GAP personnel fumbled their mission to locate the whereabouts of Arturo Marshall, made Chilean military intelligence aware of the use of GAP in this manner. This led to the disentanglement of the GAP from MIR, which was put under the formal control of the ruling Socialist Party, leading to the resignation or dismissal of many of the MIR members of the GAP.&#91;1&#93;
At the outset of the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, the presidential palace of La Moneda was defended by members of the GAP, 20 detectives of the Investigations Police of Chile (PDI), and 300 carabineros.&#91;4&#93; As news of the military uprising reached Santiago, leader Bruno the White led a dozen armed GAP reinforcements to the presidential residence. However, on approaching the PDI detectives stationed at the palace to rally their assistance, the group was promptly disarmed and arrested. At 9:00 a.m. on September 11, the carabineros withdrew after Gen. César Mendoza, commandant of the Carabineros de Chile, threw the force's support to the military junta.&#91;4&#93; 
The main attack against the presidential palace commenced shortly after the carabineros had withdrawn. At about 1:30 p.m. on September 11, Chilean Army infantry entered the building; following an exchange of gunfire, GAP personnel surrendered and Allende committed suicide.&#91;4&#93; Nearly 30 GAP personnel either died during the fighting, or were executed after the fall of the palace.&#91;5&#93;
The GAP was organized into three elements: Escort, Advance, and Garrison.&#91;1&#93;
The Escort group provided close protection to Allende and was composed of approximately 20 men.&#91;1&#93; The Escort group operated blue Fiat sedans; presidential motorcades would generally consist of three Escort group Fiats - one of which, bearing the license plate number "1", carried Allende - accompanied by police vehicles.&#91;1&#93;
The Advance group, led by Francisco Argandoña (nom de guerre "Mariano"), had the fewest personnel and was responsible for scouting locations to be visited by Allende prior to his arrival.&#91;1&#93;
The Garrison group was divided into three six-man sections, one assigned to each of the three presidential residences and responsible for static security at those locations in concert with police guards.&#91;1&#93;
The relationship between the GAP and the police and military was generally strained. During the failed Tanquetazo coup attempt of June 1973, as reinforced GAP elements hurried Allende to La Moneda, they encountered  a patrol of Chilean Army soldiers en route. Though the troops were loyalists, GAP personnel held them at gunpoint until the president's motorcade had passed as a precaution.&#91;1&#93; However, Unidad Popular supporters within the security forces had a more cooperative relationship with the GAP. Gen. Carlos Prats requested the GAP provide for his security, in addition to that of Allende, due to deepening distrust Prats had in his own subordinates.&#91;1&#93; And, during the Tanquetazo, after Allende instructed his GAP protectors not to accompany him into PDI headquarters, Allende's naval attache - Capt. Arturo Arata - countermanded Allende's orders and took personal command of the GAP Escort group, telling them to "get their guns out and protect" Allende.&#91;1&#93;
GAP personnel were recruited from among current Socialist Party of Chile members who were recommended by party functionaries and met physical requirements.&#91;1&#93; Selected members underwent a 15-day weapons and security training course in Cuba.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;1&#93;
GAP's capabilities were dismissed by Chilean Navy commander José Toribio Merino who wrote in his memoirs of a visit he made to Allende six days before the coup and recalled that "we found ourselves facing a fort, Disney movie style, an armed protected fortress ... a laughable show. What they were doing they took seriously ... They seemed like kids playing bandits".&#91;8&#93;

The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2).&#91;1&#93; The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.&#91;4&#93;&#91;6&#93; The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; As of 3 June 2020, more than 6.39 ;million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 380,000 deaths; more than 2.74 ;million people have recovered.&#91;5&#93;
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.&#91;9&#93;&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.&#91;15&#93; The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93; There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.&#91;9&#93; Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.&#91;18&#93;
Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.&#91;9&#93;&#91;19&#93; Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.
The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,&#91;20&#93; including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.&#91;21&#93; It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,&#91;22&#93; widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93; Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 177 countries, affecting approximately 98.6 percent of the world's student population.&#91;28&#93; Misinformation about the virus has spread through social media and the mass media.&#91;29&#93; There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against oriental people (perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates).&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93;
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,&#91;316&#93;&#91;317&#93; and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.&#91;318&#93; On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.&#91;319&#93;&#91;320&#93;
Several of the early cases had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market&#91;321&#93; and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.&#91;322&#93; The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‑CoV‑2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,&#91;323&#93; pangolin coronaviruses,&#91;324&#93;&#91;325&#93; and SARS-CoV.&#91;326&#93; The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.&#91;327&#93;&#91;328&#93; The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.&#91;329&#93;
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 ;December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.&#91;330&#93;&#91;331&#93; Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.&#91;332&#93;&#91;333&#93;&#91;334&#93; On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.&#91;335&#93;&#91;336&#93;
The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.&#91;337&#93; Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly passed China's.&#91;338&#93;
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.&#91;339&#93; As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population.&#91;340&#93; Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.&#91;341&#93;&#91;342&#93; An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.&#91;343&#93; Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.&#91;344&#93;&#91;345&#93;
On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.&#91;346&#93; Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.&#91;347&#93;&#91;348&#93; However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.&#91;349&#93;
Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.&#91;350&#93; It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.&#91;351&#93; A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults.&#91;352&#93; Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.&#91;353&#93;
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,&#91;354&#93; but a subsequent analysis has concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).&#91;355&#93; R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. As of mid-May 2020, the effective R is close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas is stable or decreasing.&#91;356&#93;

Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from ;6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.&#91;361&#93; As of 3 June 2020, approximately 380,000&#91;5&#93; deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 5 February&#91;update&#93;, about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.&#91;362&#93;
The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.&#91;363&#93; The first death outside of China occurred on 1 ;February in the Philippines,&#91;364&#93; and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.&#91;365&#93;
Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without testing, e.g. at home or in nursing homes.&#91;366&#93; Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting.&#91;367&#93; Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.&#91;368&#93;&#91;369&#93; In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal.&#91;368&#93; This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.&#91;370&#93;
Several measures are used to quantify mortality.&#91;371&#93; These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, effectiveness and rapidity of government response,&#91;372&#93;&#91;373&#93;&#91;374&#93; time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.&#91;375&#93; Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.&#91;376&#93;
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0 ;percent (380,580 deaths for 6,395,328 cases) as of 3 June 2020.&#91;5&#93; The number varies by region.&#91;377&#93;
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known.&#91;378&#93; In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94% (95% confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China.&#91;379&#93;&#91;380&#93; The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 ;May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.&#91;381&#93; The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4% (0.2% to 1%) and that 35% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26% (as of 20 May).&#91;382&#93;&#91;383&#93;

The WHO said on 11 March 2020 the pandemic could be controlled.&#91;8&#93; The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be."&#91;386&#93; The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".&#91;387&#93; William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is "so readily transmissible", it "might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.&#91;388&#93;
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.&#91;9&#93;&#91;390&#93; Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible.&#91;391&#93; As at 6 ;April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5% to 80%.&#91;392&#93;
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.&#91;393&#93;&#91;394&#93;&#91;395&#93;
Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.&#91;9&#93; Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.&#91;14&#93; Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.&#91;394&#93;
COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.&#91;12&#93;&#91;396&#93; The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ;ft) of social distance;&#91;9&#93; the U.S. CDC recommends 2 metres (6 ;ft).&#91;10&#93; People can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, but it is unclear how often this happens.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;12&#93; One estimate of the number of those infected who are asymptomatic is 40%.&#91;397&#93;
People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).&#91;12&#93; They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.&#91;12&#93;
When the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can, though less commonly, remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.&#91;9&#93; On surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection,&#91;12&#93; and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads.&#91;10&#93; It is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method, but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304).&#91;12&#93;&#91;398&#93;&#91;399&#93; Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands.&#91;9&#93; Disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for COVID‑19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body.&#91;400&#93;
Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;12&#93;&#91;401&#93; Although COVID‑19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, kissing, intimate contact, and faecal-oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus.&#91;402&#93;&#91;403&#93; Some medical procedures are aerosol-generating&#91;404&#93; and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal.&#91;9&#93;&#91;12&#93;
The virus may occur in breastmilk.&#91;406&#93;
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.&#91;326&#93; All features of the novel SARS‑CoV‑2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.&#91;407&#93;
SARS‑CoV‑2 is closely related to SARS‑CoV, and is thought to have a zoonotic origin.&#91;323&#93; SARS‑CoV‑2 genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, and is 96 percent identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples&#91;408&#93; and 92 percent identical to pangolin coronavirus.&#91;409&#93;
COVID-19 can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.&#91;410&#93;&#91;411&#93;
The standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.&#91;412&#93;
A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.&#91;413&#93; Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.&#91;414&#93;
Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.&#91;415&#93; The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.&#91;416&#93; Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.&#91;415&#93; A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.&#91;411&#93;
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.&#91;417&#93;&#91;418&#93; Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.&#91;419&#93;&#91;420&#93; Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.&#91;421&#93;
Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.&#91;422&#93; The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.&#91;423&#93;
Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.&#91;424&#93; There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organisations are working to develop one.&#91;425&#93;
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.&#91;19&#93; CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.&#91;417&#93; The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.&#91;418&#93;&#91;426&#93; It is not clear if washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.&#91;427&#93;
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.&#91;428&#93; The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.&#91;429&#93;
Recommendations for wearing masks have been a subject of debate.&#91;431&#93; The WHO has recommended healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19.&#91;432&#93; China and the United States, among other countries, have encouraged the use of face masks or cloth face coverings more generally by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus by asymptomatic individuals as a precautionary principle.&#91;433&#93;&#91;434&#93; Several national and local governments have made wearing masks mandatory.&#91;435&#93;
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing this type of mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing.&#91;432&#93;
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.&#91;418&#93;&#91;436&#93;&#91;437&#93; Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.&#91;438&#93;&#91;439&#93; Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.&#91;440&#93;
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10.&#91;441&#93; On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.&#91;442&#93; A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.&#91;437&#93;
Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.&#91;443&#93;&#91;444&#93;
In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.&#91;445&#93;&#91;446&#93;
Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic. These include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.&#91;447&#93;&#91;448&#93;
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.&#91;449&#93;&#91;450&#93;
Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.&#91;451&#93;&#91;452&#93; The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.&#91;453&#93; Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.&#91;9&#93;&#91;16&#93;&#91;454&#93;
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation. Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.&#91;459&#93; Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.&#91;387&#93;
Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.&#91;455&#93; This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.&#91;455&#93; Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.&#91;460&#93;
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.&#91;461&#93; Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.&#91;462&#93;
Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.&#91;387&#93;
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.&#91;463&#93; The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.&#91;464&#93;
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 ;April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.&#91;464&#93; Users could then receive a message if they've been in close contact with someone who has subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.&#91;464&#93;
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.&#91;465&#93;&#91;466&#93; The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.&#91;467&#93; In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.&#91;468&#93;
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.&#91;469&#93; The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.&#91;469&#93;&#91;470&#93; In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.&#91;471&#93;&#91;472&#93;&#91;473&#93;
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.&#91;474&#93;&#91;475&#93; In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.&#91;476&#93;&#91;477&#93;&#91;478&#93; On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.&#91;479&#93;&#91;480&#93;
Antiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19, as well as medications targeting the immune response.&#91;481&#93; None has yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials.&#91;481&#93; However, remdesivir may have an effect on the time it takes to recover from the virus.&#91;482&#93; Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1 ;May, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19. The interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments, and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks.&#91;483&#93; Taking over-the-counter cold medications,&#91;484&#93; drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.&#91;417&#93; Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.&#91;485&#93; The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.&#91;486&#93; Several compounds which were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.&#91;487&#93;
There are several theories about where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.&#91;489&#93; According to an unpublicized report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year old citizen in Hubei province.&#91;490&#93; There were four men and five women reported to be infected on November, but none of them were "patient zero".&#91;490&#93; Starting from December, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December&#91;491&#93; and at least 266 by 31 December.&#91;492&#93; According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.&#91;322&#93; In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but it was not the site of the initial outbreak.&#91;493&#93;
On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.&#91;494&#93; A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.&#91;495&#93;On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".&#91;496&#93; Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 ;January),&#91;497&#93; were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.&#91;498&#93;
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases&#91;316&#93;&#91;499&#93;&#91;500&#93;—enough to trigger an investigation.&#91;318&#93;
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.&#91;501&#93; In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.&#91;408&#93; On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.&#91;502&#93; Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,&#91;503&#93; and more may have been infected.&#91;504&#93; A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".&#91;332&#93;&#91;505&#93; On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.&#91;504&#93;
On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.&#91;506&#93; As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.&#91;507&#93; On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths.&#91;508&#93; By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.&#91;509&#93; Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.&#91;510&#93; Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019&#91;511&#93;&#91;512&#93; and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 ;February 2020.&#91;513&#93;
As of 3 June 2020, more than 6.39 ;million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 380,000 people have died and more than 2.74 ;million have recovered.&#91;514&#93;&#91;515&#93;
A total of 188&#91;5&#93; countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far. Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.&#91;516&#93; National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).&#91;517&#93;
By 26 March, 1.7 ;billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown,&#91;518&#93; which increased to 3.9 ;billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.&#91;519&#93;&#91;520&#93;
By late April, around 300 ;million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 ;million people were under lockdown in Latin America.&#91;521&#93; Nearly 300 ;million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States,&#91;522&#93; around 100 ;million people in the Philippines,&#91;521&#93; about 59 ;million people in South Africa,&#91;523&#93; and 1.3 ;billion people have been under lockdown in India.&#91;524&#93;&#91;525&#93; On 21 May 100,000 new infections occurred worldwide, the most since the start of the pandemic, while overall 5 ;million cases were surpassed.&#91;526&#93;
As of 19 ;May ;2020&#91;update&#93;, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan&#91;527&#93; and North Korea,&#91;528&#93; although these countries likely also have cases.&#91;529&#93; Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly South Korea,&#91;530&#93; Taiwan,&#91;531&#93; and Vietnam,&#91;532&#93; has allowed them to fare comparatively well.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 ;December 2019 in Wuhan;&#91;330&#93; one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.&#91;335&#93; Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 December, upon which her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.&#91;533&#93;&#91;534&#93; Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.&#91;533&#93; A public notice was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December, confirming 27 cases and suggesting wearing face masks.&#91;500&#93; The WHO was informed on the same day.&#91;316&#93; As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.&#91;535&#93; The Chinese National Health Commission initially said there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.&#91;536&#93; In a 14 January conference call, Chinese officials said privately that human-to-human transmission was a possibility, and pandemic preparations were needed.&#91;537&#93; In a briefing posted during the night of 14–15 January, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out.&#91;538&#93;
On 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus.&#91;539&#93; That same day, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and State Council premier Li Keqiang issued their first public comments about the virus, telling people in infected areas to practice social distancing and avoid travel.&#91;540&#93;&#91;541&#93; During the Chinese New Year travel period, authorities instigated a City of Wuhan lockdown.&#91;542&#93; On 10 February the Chinese government launched a radical campaign described by paramount leader and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi as a "people's war" to contain the viral spread.&#91;543&#93; In "the largest quarantine in human history",&#91;544&#93; a cordon sanitaire on 23 January stopped travel in and out of Wuhan,&#91;545&#93;&#91;546&#93; then extended to fifteen Hubei cities affecting about 57 ;million people.&#91;547&#93; Private vehicle use was banned in the city.&#91;548&#93; Several Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were also cancelled.&#91;549&#93; Authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, completed in ten days.&#91;550&#93; Leishenshan Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.&#91;551&#93; China also converted other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.&#91;552&#93;
On 26 January, the government instituted further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.&#91;554&#93; Universities and schools around the country were also closed.&#91;555&#93;&#91;556&#93;&#91;557&#93; The regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities.&#91;558&#93; Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions.&#91;559&#93; Travel restrictions were enacted in and outside of Hubei.&#91;559&#93;&#91;560&#93; Public transport was modified,&#91;561&#93; and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.&#91;559&#93;&#91;562&#93;&#91;563&#93; Control of public movement was applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 ;million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction.&#91;564&#93; In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 ;million people lost their jobs.&#91;565&#93; Many of China's nearly 300 ;million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.&#91;566&#93;&#91;567&#93;
After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus re-entering China from other countries. For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.&#91;568&#93; At the same time, a strong anti-foreigner sentiment quickly took hold,&#91;569&#93; and foreigners experienced harassment by the general public&#91;570&#93; and forced evictions from apartments and hotels.&#91;32&#93;&#91;571&#93;
On 24 March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.&#91;572&#93; The same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.&#91;573&#93; The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end. Those wishing to enter China must to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.&#91;574&#93;&#91;575&#93; The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for firms.&#91;576&#93;
The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 4 ;April, coinciding with Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online in observance of physical distancing to avoid a renewed COVID-19 outbreak.&#91;577&#93; On 25 April the last patients were discharged in Wuhan.&#91;578&#93; On 13 May the city of Jilin was put on lockdown, sparking fear of a second wave of infection.&#91;579&#93;
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS‑CoV‑2 infections on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people had died that day.&#91;581&#93;&#91;582&#93; Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events,&#91;583&#93; sporting events,&#91;584&#93; Friday prayers,&#91;585&#93; and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.&#91;586&#93; Iran allocated 5 ;trillion rials (equivalent to US$120,000,000) to combat the virus.&#91;587&#93; President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.&#91;588&#93; Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March,&#91;589&#93; although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.&#91;590&#93; Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March.&#91;591&#93;&#91;592&#93;
Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February.&#91;593&#93;&#91;594&#93; More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.&#91;594&#93;&#91;595&#93; The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 ;March.&#91;596&#93; On 15 March, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.&#91;597&#93; At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March.&#91;598&#93; By 23 March, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.&#91;599&#93; According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.&#91;600&#93; The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.&#91;601&#93; On 20 April it was reported that Iran had reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country, though there is a fear of the second wave of infection due to this move.&#91;602&#93; In March, and again in April, there were reports that Iran was under-reporting COVID-19 cases and deaths.&#91;603&#93;&#91;604&#93;
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February,&#91;605&#93; largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.&#91;605&#93;&#91;606&#93; Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.&#91;607&#93;&#91;608&#93; By 22 February&#91;update&#93;, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms.&#91;609&#93;
South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.&#91;610&#93; On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported,&#91;611&#93; rising to 3,150 on 29 February.&#91;612&#93; All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.&#91;607&#93; Airline schedules were also changed.&#91;613&#93;&#91;614&#93;
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.&#91;530&#93;&#91;615&#93; Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application,&#91;616&#93; drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day,&#91;617&#93; and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.&#91;618&#93; South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.&#91;530&#93;&#91;619&#93;&#91;620&#93;
South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis, many signing petitions either praising it or calling for impeachment.&#91;621&#93; On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.&#91;618&#93; On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 ;April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.&#91;622&#93; Per media reports on 1 ;April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.&#91;623&#93; On 15 May it was reported that about two thousand businesses were told to close again when a cluster of a hundred infected individuals was discovered; contact tracing is being done on 11,000 people.&#91;624&#93;
As of 13 ;March ;2020,&#91;update&#93; when the number of new cases became greater  than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the pandemic.&#91;625&#93;&#91;626&#93; Cases by country across Europe had doubled over periods of typically 3 to 4 days, with some countries (mostly those at earlier stages of detection) showing doubling every 2 days.&#91;627&#93;
As of 17 March,&#91;update&#93; all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case.&#91;628&#93; At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City.
As of 18 March,&#91;update&#93; more than 250 ;million people were in lockdown in Europe.&#91;629&#93;
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 in Rome.&#91;506&#93; Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.&#91;632&#93; An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.&#91;633&#93;
On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.&#91;634&#93; Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas."&#91;635&#93;&#91;636&#93;
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April,&#91;637&#93; but on 9 ;March all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.&#91;638&#93; On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.&#91;639&#93;&#91;640&#93;
On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.&#91;641&#93;&#91;642&#93;&#91;643&#93; On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.&#91;644&#93;&#91;645&#93; On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.&#91;646&#93; As of 9 May&#91;update&#93;, there were 217,185 confirmed cases, 30,201 deaths, and 99,023 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.&#91;647&#93; A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.&#91;648&#93; On 19 April, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses are asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.&#91;649&#93;
The pandemic was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands.&#91;650&#93; Post-hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by mid-February.&#91;651&#93; By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country.
The lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020.&#91;652&#93; On 29 March it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days.&#91;653&#93; By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded the most cases and deaths in the country. Medical professionals and those who live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates.&#91;654&#93; On 25 March the death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China, and only Italy's was higher.&#91;655&#93; On 2 ;April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period—at the time, the most by any country in a single day.&#91;656&#93; As of 25 ;May ;2020&#91;update&#93; the daily death toll announced by the Spanish government has been below 100 after on 17 May for the first time in two months it fell below that figure.&#91;657&#93;
Prior to 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.&#91;665&#93;&#91;666&#93; As a result, the government received criticism for the perceived lack of pace and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.&#91;667&#93;&#91;668&#93;
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising against all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.&#91;669&#93;&#91;670&#93; On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible,&#91;671&#93; and promised to pay up to 80 percent of workers' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.&#91;672&#93;
On 23 March, the prime minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through the issuing of fines and the dispersal of gatherings. Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations, and garages.&#91;673&#93;
On 24 April it was reported that one of the more promising vaccine trials had begun in England; the government has pledged, in total, more than 50 ;million pounds towards research.&#91;674&#93;
To ensure the UK health services had sufficient capacity to treat people with COVID-19, a number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.&#91;675&#93; The first to be operational was the 4000-bed capacity NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed within the ExCeL convention centre over nine days.&#91;676&#93; On 4 ;May, it was announced that the Nightingale Hospital in London would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities.&#91;677&#93; This followed reports that NHS Nightingale in London "treated 51 patients" within the first three weeks of opening.&#91;678&#93; On 5 ;May, official figures revealed that Britain had the worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The death toll in the United Kingdom was nearly 29,427 for those tested positive for the virus. Later, it was calculated at 32,313, after taking the official death count for Scotland and Northern Ireland into account.&#91;679&#93; On 16 April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 ;million doses in the UK would be available.&#91;680&#93;
Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.&#91;511&#93;&#91;512&#93; A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.&#91;681&#93;&#91;682&#93;
On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places,&#91;683&#93; and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May.&#91;684&#93;&#91;685&#93;&#91;686&#93; As of 23 April&#91;update&#93;, France has reported more than 120,804 confirmed cases, 21,856 deaths, and 42,088 recoveries,&#91;687&#93; ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.&#91;688&#93; In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.&#91;689&#93; On 18 April it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.&#91;690&#93;
Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.&#91;691&#93; Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favored forgoing a lockdown in an attempt to reach herd immunity.&#91;692&#93; The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.&#91;691&#93;&#91;693&#93; On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.&#91;694&#93;
The first cases in North America were reported in the United States in January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on 16 April.&#91;695&#93;
On 26 March 2020, the U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, with over 82,000 cases.&#91;696&#93; On 11 April 2020, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths.&#91;697&#93; As of 15 May 2020 the total cases of COVID-19 were 1,571,908 with 95,764 total deaths.&#91;698&#93;
Canada reported 60,616 cases and 3,842 deaths on 4 May,&#91;699&#93; while Mexico reported 23,471 cases and 2,154 deaths.&#91;700&#93; The Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba are the only Caribbean countries reporting more than 1,000 cases (16,908, 2,507 and 2,092 respectively), while Panama and Honduras led Central America with 14,095 and 5,527 cases, respectively.&#91;701&#93;
On 20 January 2020, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who had returned from Wuhan on 15 January.&#91;702&#93; On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency,&#91;703&#93; and restricted entry for travellers from China who were not U.S. citizens.&#91;704&#93;
On 28 January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they had developed their own testing kit.&#91;705&#93; Despite this, the United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the extent of the outbreak.&#91;706&#93;&#91;707&#93; Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government test kits, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test.&#91;706&#93;&#91;707&#93;
By 2 March there were 80 confirmed cases, with half of the cases in California. Florida and New York had declared their first two cases and the state of Washington reported many suspected cases and the first death. Vice President Pence maintained that the threat of the virus spreading throughout the U.S. was small.&#91;708&#93;&#91;709&#93;&#91;710&#93;
On 6 March, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 ;billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.&#91;711&#93;&#91;712&#93; Corporations encouraged employees to work from home.&#91;713&#93; Sports events and seasons were cancelled.&#91;22&#93;
On 13 March, Trump declared a national emergency, which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis.&#91;714&#93; Beginning on 15 March, many businesses closed or reduced hours&#91;715&#93; and schools across the country were shutting down.&#91;716&#93;&#91;717&#93; By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia.&#91;718&#93; On 26 March, the United States had more confirmed cases than any other country.&#91;509&#93; U.S. federal health inspectors surveyed 323 hospitals in late March; reporting "severe shortages" of test supplies, "widespread shortages" of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results.&#91;719&#93;
On 22 April it was reported that two Californians had died from the virus (not, as previously thought, influenza) on 6 ;and 17 February, three weeks before the first official COVID-19 death in the U.S. had been acknowledged.&#91;513&#93; By 24 April, 889,309 cases had been confirmed and 50,256 people had died.&#91;720&#93; As of 17 May, according to a New York Times database, more than 1,474,600 people had been infected and at least 88,600 had died in the United States. The Times stated that, prior to 29 April, only deaths confirmed through testing were reported, but new criteria include probable cases and deaths. As of 17 May, the U.S., which accounts for about 4.25% of the world's population, had about 29% of the confirmed coronavirus deaths.&#91;721&#93;
The White House has been criticised for downplaying the threat and controlling the messaging by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence.&#91;722&#93; On 14 April, President Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), saying they had mismanaged the pandemic. He also said the U.S. would not participate in a global effort with the WHO to develop a vaccine and drugs to combat the virus.&#91;723&#93; On 1 ;May the CDC presented a 17-page report titled "Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework" to the administration. It had been written to provide advice for faith leaders, places of business, and other public places, educators, and state and local officials as they began to reopen. The White House refused to use the report. Trump said he felt the guidelines were too restrictive, commenting "I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was."&#91;724&#93;&#91;725&#93;
By mid-May reports of new cases began to level off and most states began to open restaurants and other places of business, placing limits to the numbers of people allowed in the establishment at the same time. The head of the NIAID, Anthony Fauci, warned that if caution was not used the rate of infections could rebound and he was particularly concerned about opening the schools in the fall. President Trump expressed surprise and disapproval at Fauci's statements saying, "To me it's not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools."&#91;726&#93; Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities in response to the death of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus due to the close proximity of protesters.&#91;727&#93;
On April 17, the highest number of cases and deaths was registered in Brazil,&#91;730&#93; followed by Peru and Chile in the number of confirmed cases.&#91;731&#93;
On 20 April it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.&#91;735&#93; On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created a great deal of controversy referring to the virus as a "little flu" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has so closely matched that of U.S. president Donald Trump he has been called the "Trump of the Tropics".&#91;736&#93;
According to Michael Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, early detection is vital because the continent's health systems "are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks".&#91;737&#93;&#91;738&#93; Advisers say that a strategy based on testing could allow African countries to minimise lockdowns that inflict enormous hardship on those who depend on income earned day by day to be able to feed themselves and their families. Even in the best scenario, the United Nations says 74 ;million test kits and 30,000 ventilators will be needed by the continent's 1.3 ;billion people in 2020.&#91;739&#93;  Most of the reported cases are from six countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria, but it is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in other African countries with poorer health care systems.&#91;740&#93; Cases have been confirmed in all African countries, with Lesotho the last country to report its first coronavirus case on 13 May 2020.&#91;741&#93; There have been no reported cases in the British Overseas Territories of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.&#91;742&#93;
On 19 May 2020, Australia filed a motion with the UN for an inquiry into the origins of the virus, and the response of the UN and governments. More than 100 countries supported this motion, and it was passed unanimously.&#91;745&#93;&#91;746&#93;
As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas,&#91;747&#93; or for all travellers.&#91;748&#93; Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.&#91;749&#93; A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modest effects delaying the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.&#91;750&#93; Researchers concluded that "travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late".&#91;751&#93;
The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy,&#91;752&#93;&#91;753&#93; a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.&#91;754&#93;&#91;755&#93;
Owing to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.&#91;756&#93; Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.&#91;757&#93;&#91;758&#93; On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.&#91;759&#93; Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.&#91;760&#93;
On 15 February, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess,&#91;761&#93; and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.&#91;762&#93; In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.&#91;763&#93;&#91;764&#93; On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.&#91;765&#93;
Some Chinese students at American universities sent aid, including 50,000 N95 masks on 30 January.&#91;766&#93; The humanitarian aid organisation Direct Relief sent 200,000 face masks and other personal protective equipment to the Wuhan Union Hospital the same day.&#91;767&#93; On 5 ;February, the Chinese foreign ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China,&#91;768&#93; and Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 ;million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts and protect "at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia".&#91;769&#93; Interaksyon said the Chinese government had donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6 ;February after Philippine senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 ;million masks to Wuhan.&#91;770&#93; On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send $2.26 ;million worth of aid to China.&#91;771&#93;
Several countries donated masks, medical equipment or money to China, including Japan,&#91;772&#93; Turkey, Russia,&#91;773&#93; Malaysia,&#91;774&#93; Germany,&#91;775&#93; and Canada.&#91;776&#93;&#91;777&#93; The U.S. State Department said on 7 ;February it had facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China.&#91;778&#93; The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 ;million pledge to China and other countries to aid their fights against the virus,&#91;779&#93; though on 21 March China said it had not received epidemic funding from the U.S. government and reiterated that on 3 ;April.&#91;citation needed&#93; Several corporations have also donated money or medical equipment to China.&#91;780&#93;
After cases in China stabilised, the country began sending aid to other nations.&#91;781&#93; In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak;&#91;782&#93;&#91;783&#93; China sent three medical teams and donated more than forty tons of medical supplies to Italy.&#91;784&#93; Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 ;million testing kits, 6 ;million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union.&#91;785&#93;&#91;786&#93; He later sent 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ;ventilators to Panama.&#91;787&#93;
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concerns over Chinese-made masks and test kits.&#91;788&#93; For instance, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of 30 percent, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks which were said to be defective,&#91;789&#93; but China said this was due to misuse.&#91;790&#93; Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China but were in fact from Colombia.&#91;791&#93; The Philippines stopped using test kits donated by China due to their 40 percent accuracy.&#91;792&#93; The Chinese government said product instructions might not have been followed, and that some products were not purchased directly from certified companies.&#91;793&#93; Chinese aid was well-received in parts of Latin America and Africa.&#91;794&#93;&#91;795&#93; On 2 ;April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.&#91;796&#93; According to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Turkey provides the largest amount of humanitarian aid in the world while ranking third worldwide in supplying medical aid.&#91;797&#93;&#91;798&#93;
Taiwan notified the WHO of a new virus on 31 December 2019.&#91;799&#93; The WHO has commended the Chinese authorities for providing "regular updates", contrasting it to the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak when they were accused of secrecy.&#91;800&#93; The WHO stated on 5 ;January that cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported,&#91;801&#93; and issued technical briefings on 10 and 11 January warning of risks of human-to-human transmission and urging precautions due to the similarity to earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks.&#91;802&#93; though in public announcements it said there was "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission" as late as 14 January.&#91;803&#93; On 20 January, the WHO said it was "now very clear" human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had occurred, given that healthcare workers had been infected.&#91;804&#93; On 27 January, the WHO assessed the risk of the outbreak to be "high at the global level".&#91;805&#93;
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), warning that "all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread" of the virus,&#91;7&#93;&#91;806&#93; following an increase in cases outside China. This was the sixth-ever PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems" but that the WHO did not "recommend limiting trade and movement".&#91;7&#93;&#91;807&#93;&#91;808&#93;
On 11 February, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide the "power of the entire UN system in the response". A UN Crisis Management Team was activated, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations, which the WHO stated will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak".&#91;809&#93; On 25 February, the WHO declared "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," stating that while it was too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be "in a phase of preparedness".&#91;810&#93; On 28 February, WHO officials said the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.&#91;811&#93; On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.&#91;812&#93; The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".&#91;8&#93; Critics have said the WHO handled the pandemic inadequately and that the public health emergency declaration and pandemic classification came too late.&#91;813&#93;
The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes. One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ ;billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.&#91;814&#93; Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China.&#91;815&#93;&#91;816&#93; On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08)&#91;817&#93; and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent.&#91;818&#93; On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook.&#91;819&#93; Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.&#91;820&#93; Many consider an economic recession likely.&#91;821&#93;&#91;822&#93;
Lloyd's of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 ;billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season and 9/11, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.&#91;823&#93;
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed.&#91;824&#93; The cruise line industry was hard hit,&#91;825&#93; and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.&#91;826&#93; International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.&#91;827&#93;
The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.&#91;828&#93; Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop.&#91;829&#93; This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February. Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.&#91;830&#93;
Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally.&#91;831&#93;&#91;832&#93; More than 40 ;million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims.&#91;833&#93;
According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 ;million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.&#91;834&#93;
The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.&#91;835&#93; The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust). &#91;836&#93; The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.&#91;837&#93; According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.&#91;838&#93;&#91;839&#93; It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.&#91;840&#93;
The impact of the coronavirus outbreak was worldwide. The virus created a shortage of precursors used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine. The Yuancheng Group, located in Wuhan, China, is one of the leading suppliers of these chemical raw materials.&#91;841&#93; Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the street of the UK.&#91;842&#93; U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors.&#91;843&#93;
The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis.&#91;844&#93;&#91;845&#93; David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said "we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months."&#91;846&#93;
Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 ;million people could starve, for a total of 265 ;million by the end of 2020.&#91;847&#93;&#91;846&#93;&#91;848&#93;
In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.&#91;849&#93; On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.&#91;850&#93; June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.&#91;850&#93;
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.&#91;851&#93; In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.&#91;852&#93;&#91;853&#93;&#91;854&#93;
Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.&#91;853&#93; Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.&#91;855&#93;&#91;856&#93;&#91;853&#93; With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims,&#91;853&#93; other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.&#91;853&#93; Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed,&#91;585&#93;&#91;592&#93; while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.&#91;857&#93;&#91;858&#93;
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War. Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League,&#91;859&#93; 2019–20 Premier League,&#91;860&#93; UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season,&#91;861&#93; and 2019–20 NHL season.&#91;862&#93; The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that they will be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021".&#91;863&#93;&#91;864&#93;
The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.&#91;865&#93;&#91;866&#93; The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in the Netherlands in May, was postponed until 2021.&#91;867&#93; Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.&#91;868&#93; Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts&#91;869&#93; or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work.&#91;870&#93; Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid uncertainty.&#91;871&#93;
The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities,&#91;872&#93; isolations or deaths of multiple politicians,&#91;873&#93; and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.&#91;874&#93;
The Chinese government has been criticised by the United States government,&#91;875&#93; UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove,&#91;876&#93; and others&#91;877&#93; for its handling of the pandemic. A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak. Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.&#91;878&#93; The U.S. intelligence community says China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases.&#91;879&#93;
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy&#91;880&#93;&#91;881&#93;—Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said "only China responded bilaterally", not the EU.&#91;882&#93; On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.&#91;883&#93; President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.&#91;884&#93; Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.&#91;885&#93; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."&#91;886&#93;
The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.&#91;888&#93;&#91;889&#93;&#91;890&#93; Political analysts anticipated it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.&#91;891&#93;&#91;892&#93; Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.&#91;893&#93;
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.&#91;894&#93;&#91;895&#93; The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying "it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating."&#91;896&#93;
The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.&#91;595&#93;&#91;897&#93; Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.&#91;898&#93; Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.&#91;899&#93;
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.&#91;900&#93; South Korea criticised Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.&#91;901&#93; South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.&#91;621&#93;
Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic. Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.&#91;902&#93;&#91;903&#93; In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.&#91;904&#93; In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.&#91;905&#93; In some countries, including Egypt,&#91;906&#93; Turkey,&#91;907&#93; and Thailand,&#91;904&#93; opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.&#91;908&#93;
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities and colleges.
Most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19.&#91;909&#93; As of 24 May 2020, approximately 1.725 billion learners are currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 153 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 24 are implementing local closures, impacting about 98.6 percent of the world's student population. 10 countries' schools are currently open.&#91;910&#93; 
On 23 March 2020, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) released a statement announcing the cancellation of Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International AS &amp; A Level, Cambridge AICE Diploma, and Cambridge Pre-U examinations for the May/June 2020 series across all countries.&#91;911&#93; International Baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled.&#91;912&#93; In addition, Advanced Placement Exams, SAT administrations, and ACT administrations have been moved online and cancelled.
School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families.&#91;913&#93; but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences.&#91;914&#93;&#91;915&#93; School closures in response to the pandemic have shed light on various social and economic issues, including student debt,&#91;916&#93; digital learning,&#91;917&#93;&#91;918&#93; food insecurity,&#91;919&#93; and homelessness,&#91;920&#93;&#91;921&#93; as well as access to childcare,&#91;922&#93; health care,&#91;923&#93; housing,&#91;924&#93; internet,&#91;925&#93; and disability services.&#91;926&#93; The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.&#91;28&#93;&#91;927&#93;
The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38 per cent fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40 per cent fewer in Spain.&#91;929&#93; The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital."&#91;930&#93; There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment.&#91;930&#93; Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions.&#91;931&#93;
The worldwide disruption caused by the pandemic has resulted in numerous impacts on the environment and the climate. The severe decline in planned travel&#91;939&#93; has caused many regions to experience a drop in air pollution. In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25 ;per cent reduction in carbon emissions&#91;940&#93; and ;50 per cent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions,&#91;941&#93; which one Earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months.&#91;942&#93;&#91;943&#93; However, the outbreak has also provided cover for illegal activities such as deforestation of the Amazon rainforest&#91;944&#93;&#91;945&#93; and poaching in Africa,&#91;946&#93;&#91;947&#93; hindered environmental diplomacy efforts,&#91;948&#93; and created economic fallout that some predict will slow investment in green energy technologies.&#91;949&#93;
Since the start of the outbreak, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent,&#91;950&#93;&#91;951&#93;&#91;952&#93; Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people deserving the virus.&#91;953&#93;&#91;954&#93;&#91;955&#93; Citizens in countries including Malaysia,&#91;956&#93; New Zealand,&#91;957&#93; Singapore,&#91;958&#93; Japan,&#91;959&#93; Vietnam,&#91;960&#93; and South Korea lobbied to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.&#91;961&#93; Chinese people and other Asians in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.&#91;31&#93;&#91;962&#93;&#91;963&#93; U.S. president Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus", which critics say is racist and anti-Chinese.&#91;964&#93;&#91;965&#93;&#91;966&#93;
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,&#91;968&#93;&#91;969&#93; as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.&#91;970&#93; Paris has seen riots break out over police treatment of ethnic minorities during the coronavirus lockdown.&#91;971&#93; Racism and xenophobia towards South Asians and Southeast Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.&#91;972&#93;&#91;973&#93;&#91;974&#93; South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.&#91;975&#93;&#91;976&#93;
In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "disposal".&#91;977&#93; Some black people were evicted from their homes by police and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.&#91;978&#93; Chinese racism and xenophobia was criticised by foreign governments and diplomatic corps,&#91;979&#93; and China apologised for discriminatory practices such as restaurants excluding black customers,&#91;980&#93; although these and other accusations of harassment, discrimination and eviction of black people in China continued.&#91;981&#93;
Many newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their coronavirus-related articles and posts,&#91;982&#93; while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.&#91;983&#93; Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.&#91;984&#93;
The pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease.&#91;985&#93;&#91;986&#93;&#91;987&#93; False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media,&#91;986&#93;&#91;988&#93; text messaging,&#91;989&#93; and mass media,&#91;990&#93; including the tabloid media,&#91;991&#93; conservative media,&#91;992&#93;&#91;993&#93; and state media of countries such as China,&#91;994&#93;&#91;995&#93; Russia,&#91;996&#93;&#91;997&#93; Iran,&#91;998&#93; and Turkmenistan.&#91;986&#93;&#91;999&#93; It has also been spread by state-backed covert operations to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries.&#91;1,000&#93;&#91;1,001&#93;&#91;1,002&#93; In some countries, such as India,&#91;1,003&#93; Bangladesh,&#91;1,004&#93; and Ethiopia,&#91;1,005&#93;  journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic.&#91;1,006&#93;
Misinformation has been propagated by celebrities, politicians&#91;1,007&#93;&#91;1,008&#93; (including heads of state in countries such as the United States,&#91;1,009&#93;&#91;1,010&#93; Iran,&#91;1,011&#93; and Brazil&#91;1,012&#93;), and other prominent public figures.&#91;1,013&#93; Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests, supposed preventives, and "miracle" cures.&#91;1,014&#93;&#91;1,015&#93; Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus.&#91;1,016&#93;&#91;1,017&#93;&#91;1,018&#93; Some people have claimed the virus is a bio-weapon accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory,&#91;1,019&#93;&#91;1,020&#93; a population control scheme, the result of a spy operation,&#91;987&#93;&#91;988&#93;&#91;1,021&#93; or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks.&#91;1,022&#93;

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).&#91;9&#93; It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; The first case may be traced back to 17 November 2019.&#91;12&#93; As of 3 June 2020, more than 6.39 ;million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 380,000 deaths. More than 2.74 ;million people have recovered.&#91;8&#93;
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;13&#93; While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) likely precipitated by a cytokine storm,&#91;citation needed&#93; multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.&#91;5&#93;&#91;17&#93;
The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,&#91;a&#93; most often via small droplets produced by coughing,&#91;b&#93; sneezing, and talking.&#91;6&#93;&#91;18&#93;&#91;20&#93; The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.&#91;6&#93; Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.&#91;6&#93;&#91;18&#93; It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.&#91;6&#93;&#91;18&#93; The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.&#91;21&#93; Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93;
Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.&#91;7&#93;&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana is recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93; Medical grade facemasks such as N95 masks should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders and those who care for infected individuals.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93;
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are no vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19.&#91;6&#93; On 1 ;May 2020, the United States gave emergency use authorization to the antiviral remdesivir for people hospitalized with severe COVID‑19&#91;citation needed&#93; Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.&#91;30&#93; The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID‑19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93; on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.&#91;11&#93; Local transmission of the disease has occurred in most countries across all six WHO regions.&#91;33&#93;
Fever is the most common symptom, but it is highly variable in severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having fever at all.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93; In one study, only 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.&#91;citation needed&#93; A lack of fever does not verify someone is disease free.
Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.&#91;1&#93;&#91;5&#93;&#91;36&#93; Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93; Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions.&#91;40&#93; Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.&#91;41&#93; A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.&#91;42&#93;&#91;43&#93; Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.&#91;13&#93;&#91;44&#93;
As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The typical incubation period for COVID‑19 is five or six days, but it can range from one to fourteen days&#91;6&#93;&#91;45&#93; with approximately ten percent of cases taking longer.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93;
An early key to the diagnosis is the tempo of the illness.  Early symptoms may include a wide variety of symptoms but infrequently involves shortness of breath. Shortness of breath usually develops several days after initial symptoms. Shortness of breath that begins immediately along with fever and cough is more likely to be due to anxiety than SARS-CoV-2. The most critical days of illness tend to be those following the development of shortness of breath.&#91;49&#93;
A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.&#91;citation needed&#93;&#91;50&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93; These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not yet fully known.&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93; However, preliminary evidence suggests they may contribute to the spread of the disease.&#91;53&#93;
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.&#91;10&#93;&#91;14&#93;&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93; Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.&#91;56&#93; Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury.&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93; Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).&#91;59&#93; Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;
COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.&#91;20&#93;&#91;62&#93; The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ;ft) of social distance;&#91;6&#93; the U.S. CDC recommends 2 metres (6 ;ft).&#91;18&#93; People can transmit the virus without showing symptoms, but it is unclear how often this happens.&#91;6&#93;&#91;18&#93;&#91;20&#93; One estimate of the number of those infected who are asymptomatic is 40%.&#91;63&#93;
People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).&#91;20&#93; They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.&#91;20&#93;
When the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can, though less commonly, remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.&#91;6&#93; On surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection,&#91;20&#93; and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads.&#91;18&#93; It is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method, but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper, up to one day on cardboard, and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304).&#91;20&#93;&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93; Surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands.&#91;6&#93; Disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for COVID‑19, and cause health problems when not used properly, such as when used inside the human body.&#91;66&#93;
Sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus.&#91;6&#93;&#91;18&#93;&#91;20&#93;&#91;67&#93; Although COVID‑19 is not a sexually transmitted infection, kissing, intimate contact, and faecal-oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus.&#91;68&#93;&#91;69&#93; Some medical procedures are aerosol-generating&#91;70&#93; and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal.&#91;6&#93;&#91;20&#93;
COVID‑19 is a new disease, and many of the details of its spread are still under investigation.&#91;6&#93;&#91;18&#93;&#91;20&#93; It spreads easily between people—easier than influenza but not as easily as measles.&#91;18&#93; Estimates of the number of people infected by one person with COVID-19 (the R0) have varied widely. The WHO's initial estimates of the R0 were 1.4-2.5 (average 1.95), however a more recent review found the basic R0 (without control measures) to be higher at 3.28 and the median R0 to be 2.79.&#91;71&#93;
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.&#91;74&#93; It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).&#91;40&#93; In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in the binding domain of the S protein between the coronaviruses from pangolins and those from humans; however, whole-genome comparison to date found that at most 92% of genetic material was shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.&#91;75&#93;
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.&#91;76&#93; The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.&#91;77&#93; The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,&#91;78&#93;&#91;79&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93; though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.&#91;80&#93; As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.&#91;79&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93;
SARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brainstem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the central nervous system (CNS). While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93;
The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium&#91;83&#93; as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.&#91;84&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93;
The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.&#91;85&#93; An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,&#91;38&#93; and is more frequent in severe disease.&#91;86&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93; Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.&#91;85&#93; ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.&#91;85&#93;&#91;87&#93; A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID‑19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.&#91;88&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93;&#91;89&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93; Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.&#91;90&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93;
Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.&#91;90&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93; Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients in both China and New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.&#91;91&#93;
Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.&#91;92&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93;
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein ;1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.&#91;38&#93;
Additionally, people with COVID‑19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.&#91;93&#93;
Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID‑19 patients.&#91;citation needed&#93; Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.&#91;92&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93;
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.&#91;95&#93; The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).&#91;96&#93; The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.&#91;21&#93;&#91;97&#93; Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.&#91;98&#93;&#91;99&#93; Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.&#91;100&#93; Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.&#91;10&#93;&#91;101&#93;&#91;102&#93; As of 4 ;April ;2020&#91;update&#93;, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93; The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.&#91;106&#93; The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.&#91;107&#93;
Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count.&#91;108&#93;
A study asked hospitalised COVID‑19 patients to cough into a sterile container, thus producing a saliva sample, and detected the virus in eleven of twelve patients using RT-PCR. This technique has the potential of being quicker than a swab and involving less risk to health care workers (collection at home or in the car).&#91;67&#93;
Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.&#91;22&#93; Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.&#91;22&#93;&#91;109&#93;
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#91;110&#93;
Few data are available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID‑19.&#91;111&#93;&#91;112&#93; The main pathological findings at autopsy are:&#91;citation needed&#93;
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.&#91;121&#93;&#91;122&#93;&#91;123&#93; The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.&#91;121&#93; Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.&#91;121&#93; The CDC has recommended cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.&#91;124&#93; The U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID‑19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.&#91;125&#93;
As a COVID-19 vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest,&#91;130&#93; a key part of managing COVID‑19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".&#91;117&#93; This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.&#91;117&#93;&#91;120&#93;
Several countries have recommended that healthy individuals wear face masks or cloth face coverings (like scarves or bandanas) at least in certain public settings, including China,&#91;131&#93; Hong Kong,&#91;132&#93; Spain,&#91;133&#93; Italy,&#91;134&#93; Russia,&#91;135&#93; and the United States.&#91;26&#93; This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is a complementary measure to established preventive measures such as social distancing.&#91;26&#93;&#91;136&#93; Face coverings minimise the excretion of respiratory droplets by infected individuals while breathing, talking and coughing.&#91;26&#93;&#91;136&#93; Non-medical cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana are recommended for the general public in places where social distancing is difficult to maintain.&#91;26&#93;&#91;136&#93; Medical grade facemasks such as N95 masks should be reserved and prioritised for healthcare workers and first responders.&#91;26&#93;&#91;29&#93;&#91;136&#93;
Those diagnosed with COVID‑19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.&#91;28&#93;&#91;137&#93; The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing. It further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.&#91;121&#93;
For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis". Glycerol is added as a humectant.&#91;138&#93;
Handwashing instructions
Prevention efforts are multiplicative, with effects far beyond that of a single spread. Each avoided case leads to more avoided cases down the line, which in turn can stop the outbreak in its tracks.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93;&#91;141&#93; The CDC recommends those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.&#91;28&#93; Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.&#91;citation needed&#93;&#91;142&#93; Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.&#91;143&#93; Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.&#91;144&#93;
The WHO, the Chinese National Health Commission, and the United States' National Institutes of Health have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID‑19.&#91;125&#93;&#91;145&#93;&#91;146&#93; Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.&#91;147&#93;&#91;148&#93;
The severity of COVID‑19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.&#91;40&#93;
Children make up a small proportion of reported cases, with about 1% of cases being under 10 years and 4% aged 10–19 years.&#91;20&#93; They are likely to have milder symptoms and a lower chance of severe disease than adults. In those younger than 50 years the risk of death is less than 0.5%, while in those older than 70 it is more than 8%.&#91;153&#93;&#91;154&#93;&#91;155&#93; Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID‑19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, like Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but data for COVID‑19 is lacking.&#91;156&#93;&#91;157&#93; 
Some studies have found that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be helpful in early screening for severe illness.&#91;158&#93;
Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.&#91;159&#93; The Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 97% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 2.7 diseases.&#91;160&#93; According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five being spent hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death.&#91;160&#93; In a study of early cases, the median time from exhibiting initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.&#91;161&#93; In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.&#91;162&#93; In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.&#91;41&#93; According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.&#91;163&#93;
The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.&#91;164&#93; Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.&#91;165&#93; This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.&#91;166&#93;
The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin,&#91;73&#93; through spillover infection.&#91;167&#93; The actual origin is unknown, but the first known cases of infection happened in China. By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.&#91;150&#93;&#91;168&#93; A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID‑19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 ;December 2019.&#91;169&#93;&#91;170&#93;&#91;171&#93; Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 ;December 2019.&#91;172&#93; Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.&#91;173&#93;&#91;174&#93;
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.&#91;175&#93; These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.&#91;176&#93;
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (380,580/6,395,328) as of 3 June 2020.&#91;8&#93; The number varies by region.&#91;177&#93;
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.&#91;178&#93;
Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.&#91;179&#93;&#91;180&#93; In the United States, the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID‑19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.&#91;179&#93;
Our World in Data states that, as of 25 March 2020, the infection fatality rate (IFR) cannot be accurately calculated.&#91;183&#93; In February, one research group estimated the IFR at 0.94%, with a confidence interval between 0.37 percent to 2.9 percent.&#91;184&#93; The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 ;May).&#91;185&#93; According to CEBM, random antibody testing in Germany suggested an IFR of 0.37% (0.12% to 0.87%) there, but there have been concerns about false positives.&#91;185&#93;&#91;186&#93;&#91;187&#93;&#91;188&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93; Firm lower limits of infection fatality rates have been established in a number of locations. As of 7 ;May, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 ;million, 14,162 have died from COVID-19 (0.17% of the population).&#91;189&#93; In Bergamo province, 0.57% of the population has died.&#91;190&#93;&#91;191&#93;&#91;unreliable medical source?&#93; To get a better view on the number of people infected, initial antibody testing has been carried out, but there are no valid scientific reports based on any of them as of yet.&#91;192&#93;&#91;193&#93; On 1 ;May antibody testing in New York suggested an IFR of 0.86%.&#91;194&#93;
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.&#91;195&#93; Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.&#91;1&#93;&#91;196&#93;&#91;197&#93; The higher risk for men appears in their 50s, and begins to taper off only at 90.&#91;197&#93; In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.&#91;197&#93; The exact reasons for this sex-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioural factors could be a reason.&#91;195&#93; Sex-based immunological differences, a lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.&#91;197&#93; In Europe, of those infected with COVID‑19, 57% were men; of those infected with COVID‑19 who also died, 72% were men.&#91;198&#93; As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID‑19 infections.&#91;199&#93; Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.&#91;199&#93; A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.&#91;200&#93; School closures, lockdowns, and reduced access to healthcare following the COVID-19 pandemic may differentially affect the genders and possibly exaggerate existing gender disparity.&#91;195&#93;&#91;201&#93;
In the U.S., a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans.&#91;202&#93; Structural factors that prevent African Americans from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in "essential" occupations such as public transit and health care. Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care and of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease also increase their risk of death.&#91;203&#93; Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities.&#91;202&#93; According to a U.S health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.&#91;204&#93; The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.&#91;205&#93; Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.&#91;206&#93;
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",&#91;207&#93;&#91;208&#93;&#91;209&#93; with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".&#91;210&#93;&#91;211&#93; In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,&#91;212&#93; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.&#91;213&#93;
In January 2020, the World Health Organisation recommended 2019-nCov&#91;214&#93; and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease&#91;215&#93; as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma.&#91;216&#93;&#91;217&#93;&#91;218&#93;
The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.&#91;219&#93; WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D ;for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).&#91;220&#93; The WHO additionally uses "the COVID‑19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID‑19" in public communications.&#91;219&#93; Both the disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" in the media and public discourse.
After the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, conspiracy theorists spread misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which rapidly spread online.&#91;221&#93;&#91;222&#93;&#91;223&#93;
In Austria, 39% fewer persons sought help for cardiac symptoms in the month of March. A study estimated that there were 110 incidents of preventable cardiac death as compared to 86 confirmed deaths from Coronavirus as of 29 March.&#91;224&#93;
A preliminary study in the U.S. found 38% under-utilization of cardiac care units as compared to normal.&#91;225&#93; The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona has stated, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital."&#91;226&#93; There is also concern that persons with symptoms of stroke and appendicitis are delaying seeking help.&#91;226&#93;&#91;227&#93;
Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals. A domestic cat in Liège, Belgium, tested positive after it started showing symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting, shortness of breath) a week later than its owner, who was also positive.&#91;228&#93; Tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York, United States, tested positive for the virus and showed symptoms of COVID‑19, including a dry cough and loss of appetite.&#91;229&#93; Minks at two farms in the Netherlands also tested positive for COVID-19.&#91;230&#93;
A study on domesticated animals inoculated with the virus found that cats and ferrets appear to be "highly susceptible" to the disease, while dogs appear to be less susceptible, with lower levels of viral replication. The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.&#91;231&#93;
In March 2020, researchers from the University of Hong Kong have shown that Syrian hamsters could be a model organism for COVID-19 research.&#91;232&#93;
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.&#91;233&#93; International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.&#91;234&#93;&#91;235&#93; In March, the World Health Organisation initiated the "Solidarity Trial" to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.&#91;236&#93; The World Health Organization suspended hydroxychloroquine from its global drug trials for COVID-19 treatments on 26 May 2020 due to safety concerns. It had previously enrolled 3,500 patients from 17 countries in the Solidarity Trial.&#91;237&#93; France, Italy and Belgium also banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment.&#91;238&#93;
There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand. To minimise the harm from misinformation, medical professionals and the public are advised to expect rapid changes to available information, and to be attentive to retractions and other updates.&#91;239&#93;
There is no available vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates. Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.&#91;240&#93; Three vaccination strategies are being investigated. First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID‑19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.&#91;241&#93;
On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle, Washington, United States. The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.&#91;242&#93;
Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.&#91;243&#93;
At least 29 phase II–IV efficacy trials in COVID‑19 were concluded in March 2020, or scheduled to provide results in April from hospitals in China.&#91;244&#93;&#91;245&#93; There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.&#91;128&#93; Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.&#91;245&#93; Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the Chinese research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.&#91;244&#93;&#91;245&#93; Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.&#91;245&#93;
The COVID‑19 Clinical Research Coalition has goals to 1) facilitate rapid reviews of clinical trial proposals by ethics committees and national regulatory agencies, 2) fast-track approvals for the candidate therapeutic compounds, 3) ensure standardised and rapid analysis of emerging efficacy and safety data and 4) facilitate sharing of clinical trial outcomes before publication.&#91;246&#93;&#91;247&#93;
Several existing medications are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID‑19,&#91;233&#93; including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.&#91;236&#93;&#91;248&#93; There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.&#91;249&#93;&#91;250&#93; Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.&#91;251&#93; Remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.&#91;252&#93; Phase ;III clinical trials are underway in the U.S., China, and Italy.&#91;233&#93;&#91;244&#93;&#91;253&#93;
In 2020, a trial found that lopinavir/ritonavir was ineffective in the treatment of severe illness.&#91;254&#93; Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.&#91;252&#93;
There are mixed results as of 3 April 2020 as to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID‑19, with some studies showing little or no improvement.&#91;255&#93;&#91;256&#93; One study has shown an association between hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use with higher death rates along with other side effects.&#91;257&#93;&#91;258&#93; The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.&#91;128&#93;
Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID‑19 treatment.&#91;128&#93;
A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19. There is preliminary evidence that hydroxychloroquine may be useful in controlling cytokine storms in late-phase severe forms of the disease.&#91;259&#93;
Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.&#91;260&#93;&#91;261&#93; It is undergoing a phase ;2 non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.&#91;262&#93;&#91;263&#93; Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.&#91;264&#93;&#91;265&#93;&#91;266&#93; The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA to undergo a phase III clinical trial assessing the its effectiveness on COVID‑19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.&#91;267&#93; To date, there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across the blood-brain barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of CRS.&#91;268&#93;
Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T-cells in hospitalised patients with COVID‑19.&#91;269&#93;
The Feinstein Institute of Northwell Health announced in March a study on "a human antibody that may prevent the activity" of IL-6.&#91;270&#93;
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.&#91;271&#93; This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.&#91;271&#93; Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.&#91;272&#93; The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.&#91;272&#93; Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.&#91;271&#93; Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.&#91;271&#93; Production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.&#91;273&#93;

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93; is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness. Colloquially known as simply the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93; and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19).&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; As described by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1.&#91;12&#93; SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus.&#91;13&#93; It is contagious in humans, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93;
Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 is a strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).&#91;2&#93; It is believed to have zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; There is no evidence yet to link an intermediate animal reservoir, such as a pangolin, to its introduction to humans.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93; The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS-CoV-2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019.&#91;23&#93;
Epidemiological studies estimate each infection results in 1.4 to 3.9 new ones when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures taken. The virus primarily spreads between people through close contact and via respiratory droplets produced from coughs or sneezes.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; It mainly enters human cells by binding to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).&#91;17&#93;&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus was commonly referred to as "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus",&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; or "Wuhan virus".&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93; In January 2020, the World Health Organisation recommended "2019 novel coronavirus" (2019-nCov)&#91;34&#93;&#91;5&#93; as the provisional name for the virus. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance&#91;35&#93; against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names.&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93; On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2).&#91;21&#93; To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS-CoV-2 as "the COVID-19 virus" in public health communications&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93; and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles.&#91;20&#93;&#91;40&#93; The general public often call both SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes "coronavirus". In March 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the virus as the "Chinese virus" in tweets, interviews, and White House press briefings.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; Trump stopped using the term by 23 March 2020, citing issues of social stigma.&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93;
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#91;16&#93;&#91;45&#93;&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93; Transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.8 metres (6 ;ft).&#91;25&#93;&#91;48&#93; Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another possible cause of infection.&#91;49&#93; Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;&#91;40&#93; the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its lipid bilayer.&#91;50&#93;&#91;51&#93; Viral RNA has also been found in stool samples and semen from infected individuals.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;
The degree to which the virus is infectious during the incubation period is uncertain, but research has indicated that the pharynx reaches peak viral load approximately four days after infection&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93; or the first week of symptoms, and declines after.&#91;56&#93; On 1 ;February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that "transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission".&#91;57&#93; However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the outbreak in China suggested that "pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections" and that subclinical infections may have been the source of a majority of infections.&#91;58&#93; Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the greatest amount of virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that "a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case".&#91;59&#93;
An example that shows the role of subclinical infections in spreading COVID-19 is the event when a cruise liner arrived in Montevideo, Uruguay with 217 passengers and crew with illness on board. Testing for COVID-19 showed: 89 not infected, 24 infected and showing symptoms, 104 infected and showing no symptoms.&#91;60&#93;
There is some evidence of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including examples in felids.&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93; Some institutions have advised those infected with SARS-CoV-2 to restrict contact with animals.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93;
The first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in Wuhan, China.&#91;17&#93; The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.&#91;23&#93;&#91;65&#93;&#91;20&#93; Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market,&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93; it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.&#91;20&#93;&#91;68&#93; However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.&#91;23&#93;&#91;69&#93;  A phylogenetic network analysis of 160 early coronavirus genomes sampled from December 2019 to February 2020 revealed that the virus type most closely related to the bat coronavirus was most abundant in Guangdong, China, and designated type "A". The predominant type among samples from Wuhan, "B", is more distantly related to the bat coronavirus than the ancestral type "A".&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93;
Research into the natural reservoir of the virus strain that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak has resulted in the discovery of many SARS-like bat coronaviruses, most originating in the Rhinolophus genus of horseshoe bats. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.&#91;19&#93;&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93; Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.&#91;17&#93;&#91;74&#93;
Bats were initially considered to be the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,&#91;75&#93;&#91;76&#93; but differences between the bat coronavirus sampled at the time and SARS-CoV-2 suggested that humans were infected via an intermediate host. Arinjay Banerjee, a virologist at McMaster University, notes that "the SARS virus shared 99.8% of its genome with a civet coronavirus, which is why civets were considered the source."&#91;68&#93; Although studies had suggested some likely candidates, the number and identities of intermediate hosts remains uncertain.&#91;77&#93; Nearly half of the strain's genome had a phylogenetic lineage distinct from known relatives.&#91;78&#93;
A metagenomics study published in 2019 previously revealed that SARS-CoV, the strain of the virus that causes SARS, was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of Sunda pangolins.&#91;79&#93; On 7 ;February 2020, South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou announced that researchers had discovered a pangolin sample with a particular coronavirus; a single nucleic acid sequence of the virus was "99% similar" to that of a protein-coding RNA of SARS-CoV-2.&#91;80&#93; The authors state that "the receptor-binding domain of the S protein [that binds to the cell surface receptor during infection] of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference."&#91;81&#93; Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their poaching and trading for use in traditional Chinese medicine remains common.&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93;
A phylogenetics study published in 2020 indicates that pangolins are a reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses.&#91;85&#93; However, there is no evidence to link pangolins as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 at this moment. While there is scientific consensus that bats are the ultimate source of coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that a SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus originated in pangolins, jumped back to bats, and then jumped to humans, resulting in SARS-CoV-2. Based on whole genome sequence similarity, a pangolin coronavirus candidate strain was found to be less similar than RaTG13, but more similar than other bat coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2.&#91;84&#93; Therefore, based on maximum parsimony, a specific population of bats is more likely to have directly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans than a pangolin, while an evolutionary ancestor to bats was the source of general coronaviruses.&#91;86&#93; Microbiologists and geneticists in Texas have independently found evidence of reassortment in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.&#91;87&#93;
It is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered. According to computational simulations on protein folding, the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 should have unremarkable binding affinity. In actuality, however, it has very efficient binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Additionally, the backbone of the virus does not resemble any previously described in scientific literature used for genetic modification. The possibility that the virus could have gained the necessary adaptations through cell culture in a laboratory setting is challenged by scientists who assert that "the generation of the predicted O-linked glycans... suggest[s] the involvement of an immune system."&#91;88&#93;&#91;89&#93;
Deforestation increases the risk of new zoonotic diseases, biodiversity experts have warned.&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93;
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses.&#91;30&#93; It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.&#91;92&#93;
Like the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B).&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93; Its RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length.&#91;13&#93; SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses.&#91;20&#93;&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93;
With a sufficient number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions;&#91;13&#93;&#91;97&#93; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.&#91;98&#93; A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were "highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.&#91;98&#93; As of 7 ;May ;2020,&#91;update&#93; 4,690 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.&#91;99&#93;
On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a strain of Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus.&#91;2&#93;
Each SARS-CoV-2 virion is 50–200 nanometres in diameter.&#91;67&#93; Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope.&#91;100&#93; The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy,&#91;101&#93;&#91;102&#93; is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell;&#91;100&#93; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion.&#91;103&#93;
Protein modeling experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells to use them as a mechanism of cell entry.&#91;104&#93; By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.&#91;17&#93;&#91;105&#93;&#91;26&#93;&#91;106&#93; Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.&#91;101&#93;&#91;107&#93; SARS-CoV-2 may also use basigin to assist in cell entry.&#91;108&#93;
Initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.&#91;27&#93; After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's protease TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a fusion peptide in the S2 subunit, and the host receptor ACE2.&#91;103&#93; After fusion, an endosome forms around the virion, separating it from the rest of the host cell. The virion escapes when the pH of the endosome drops or when cathepsin, a host cysteine protease, cleaves it.&#91;103&#93; The virion then releases RNA into the cell and forces the cell to produce and disseminate copies of the virus, which infect more cells.&#91;109&#93;
SARS-CoV-2 produces at least three virulence factors that promote shedding of new virions from host cells and inhibit immune response.&#91;100&#93; Whether they include downregulation of ACE2, as seen in similar coronaviruses, remains under investigation (as of May 2020).&#91;85&#93;
Based on the low variability exhibited among known SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, the strain is thought to have been detected by health authorities within weeks of its emergence among the human population in late 2019.&#91;23&#93;&#91;110&#93; The earliest case of infection currently known is dated back to 17 November 2019 or possibly 1 December 2019.&#91;111&#93; The virus subsequently spread to all provinces of China and to more than 150 other countries in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania.&#91;112&#93; Human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed in all these regions.&#91;113&#93; On 30 January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was designated a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO,&#91;15&#93;&#91;114&#93; and on 11 March 2020 the WHO declared it a pandemic.&#91;14&#93;&#91;115&#93;
There have been about 82,000 confirmed cases of infection in mainland China.&#91;112&#93; While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear,&#91;119&#93; one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015.&#91;120&#93; Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.&#91;121&#93;&#91;122&#93; As of 3 June 2020, the percentage had decreased to 0.85%.&#91;112&#93;
As of 3 June 2020, there have been 6,395,328 total confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ongoing pandemic.&#91;112&#93; The total number of deaths attributed to the virus is 380,580.&#91;112&#93; Many recoveries from confirmed infections go unreported, but at least 2,742,306 people have recovered from confirmed infections.&#91;112&#93;

COVID-19 testing can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus and includes methods that detect the presence of the virus itself (RT-PCR, isothermal nucleic acid amplification, antigen) and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection. Detection of antibodies (serological tests) can be used both for diagnosis and for population surveillance. Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were minor or who were asymptomatic, but may not find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection since antibodies may not show up for weeks.&#91;1&#93; An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test. However, the duration and effectiveness of this immune response are still unclear.&#91;2&#93;
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.&#91;3&#93; As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, and no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3% of its population.&#91;4&#93; There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries.&#91;5&#93; This variability is also likely to be affecting reported case fatality rates, which have probably been overestimated in many countries, due to sampling bias.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;
Testing is often performed in automated, high-throughput centralized medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists.
There are two broad categories of test: a viral test for a current infection, or an antibody test for the past presence of the virus.&#91;10&#93; The CDC does not currently recommend testing for COVID-19 using a CT scan or looking for low oxygen levels.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a process that causes a very small well-defined segment of DNA to be amplified, or multiplied many hundreds of thousands of times, so there is enough of it to be detected and analyzed. Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 do not contain DNA but only RNA.&#91;11&#93; When a respiratory sample is collected from the person being tested it is treated with certain chemicals&#91;12&#93;&#91;11&#93; which break down extraneous substances and allow the RNA to be removed from the sample and tested. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a technique that first uses reverse transcription to convert the extracted RNA into DNA and then uses PCR to amplify a piece of the resulting DNA, creating enough to be examined in order to determine if it matches the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2.&#91;11&#93; Real-time PCR (qPCR)&#91;13&#93; provides advantages during the PCR portion of this process, including automating it and enabling high-throughput and more reliable instrumentation, and has become the preferred method.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; Altogether, the combined technique has been described as real-time RT-PCR&#91;16&#93; or quantitative RT-PCR&#91;17&#93; and is sometimes abbreviated qRT-PCR&#91;18&#93; or rRT-PCR&#91;19&#93; or RT-qPCR,&#91;20&#93; although sometimes just RT-PCR or PCR is used as an abbreviation. The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose that the term RT-qPCR be used,&#91;21&#93; but not all authors adhere to this. The test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample,&#91;22&#93; as well as on saliva.&#91;23&#93; Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, "from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested."&#91;24&#93; Results are generally available from within a few hours to two days.&#91;25&#93;
When testing an infected person the likelihood of detecting the virus depends on how much time has passed since the person was infected. According to Christian Drosten the RT-PCR test performed with throat swabs is reliable only in the first week of the disease. Later on the virus can disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs. For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively sample material can then be taken from the deep airways by suction catheter, or coughed up material (sputum) can be used.&#91;26&#93;
Saliva has been shown to be a common and transient medium for virus transmission&#91;27&#93; and results provided to the FDA suggest that testing saliva may be as effective as nasal and throat swabs.&#91;23&#93; The FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization for a test that collects saliva instead of using the traditional nasal swab.&#91;28&#93; It is believed this will reduce the risk for health care professionals,&#91;29&#93; will be much more comfortable for the patient,&#91;28&#93; and will enable quarantined people to collect their own samples more efficiently.&#91;29&#93; According to some experts it is too early to know the operating characteristics of the saliva test, and whether it will prove to be as sensitive as the nasopharyngeal swab test.&#91;30&#93;&#91;27&#93; Some studies suggest that the diagnostic value of saliva depends on how saliva specimens are collected (from deep throat, from oral cavity, or from salivary glands).&#91;27&#93; A recent test conducted by the Yale University School of Public Health found that saliva yielded greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of infection when compared with samples taken with nasopharyngeal swabs.&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93;

There are a number of isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods that, just like PCR, amplify a piece of the virus's genome, but are faster than PCR because they don't involve repeated cycles of heating and cooling the sample. These tests typically detect the amplified virus sequences using fluorescent tags, which have to be read out with specialized machines. In one new development, the CRISPR gene editing technology was modified to detect the viral sequences instead: if the modified CRISPR enzyme attaches to the sequence, it releases a signal which colors a paper strip. The researchers expect the resulting test to be cheap and easy to use in patient-care settings.&#91;33&#93;&#91;34&#93;
An antigen is the part of a pathogen that elicits an immune response. The antigen tests look for proteins from the surface of the virus. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes, and a nasal swab is used to collect samples.&#91;35&#93; One of the difficulties has been finding a protein target unique to SARS-CoV-2.&#91;36&#93;
Antigen tests are seen as one way to scale up testing to levels necessary to detect acute infection on the scale required.&#91;35&#93; Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests, can process only one sample at a time per machine. RT-PCR tests are accurate but it takes too much time, energy and trained personnel to run the tests.&#91;35&#93; "There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school," Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April. "But there might be with the antigen test."&#91;37&#93;
An antigen test works by taking a nasal swab from a patient and exposing that to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. Any antigens that are present will bind to the strips and give a visual readout. The process takes less than 30 minutes, can deliver results on the spot, and does not require expensive equipment or extensive training.&#91;35&#93;
In respiratory viruses often there is not enough of the antigen material present in the nasal swab to be detectable.&#91;36&#93; This would especially be true with people who are asymptomatic and who have very little if any nasal discharge. Unlike the RT-PCR test, which amplifies very small amounts of genetic material so there is enough to detect, there is no amplification of viral proteins in an antigen test.&#91;35&#93;&#91;38&#93; According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the sensitivity of similar antigen tests for respiratory diseases like the flu ranges between 34% and 80%. "Based on this information, half or more of COVID-19 infected patients might be missed by such tests, depending on the group of patients tested," the WHO said. Many scientists doubt whether an antigen test can be made reliable enough in time to be useful against COVID-19.&#91;38&#93; According to the FDA, positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but there is a higher chance of false negatives, so negative results do not rule out infection. Therefore, negative results from an antigen test may need to be confirmed with a PCR test.&#91;39&#93;
Chest CT scans and chest x-rays are not recommended for diagnosing COVID-19. Radiologic findings in COVID-19 are not specific.&#91;40&#93;&#91;41&#93; Typical features on CT initially include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral or posterior distribution.&#91;41&#93; Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation may develop as the disease evolves.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93;

Serology tests rely on drawn blood, not a nasal or throat swab, and can identify people who were infected and have already recovered from COVID-19, including those who did not know they had been infected.&#91;43&#93; As of April ;2020&#91;update&#93;, most serology tests were in the research stage of development.&#91;44&#93;
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG. According to the FDA, IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are generally detectable in blood several days after initial infection, although levels over the course of infection are not well characterized.&#91;45&#93; IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 generally become detectable 10–14 days after infection although they may be detected earlier, and normally peak around 28 days after the onset of infection.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93; Since antibodies are slow to present they are not the best markers of acute infection, but as they may persist in the bloodstream for many years they are ideal for detecting historic infections.&#91;35&#93;
Antibody tests can be used to determine the percentage of a population that have contracted the disease and are therefore presumably immune. However, it is still not clear how broad and how long and how effective this immune response is.&#91;2&#93;&#91;48&#93; As of April ;2020&#91;update&#93; "[s]ome countries are considering issuing so-called immunity passports or risk-free certificates to people who have antibodies against Covid-19, enabling them to travel or return to work assuming that they are protected against reinfection."&#91;49&#93; However, according to the World Health Organization as of 24 April 2020, "There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection."&#91;50&#93; One of the reasons for the uncertainty is that most, if not all, of the current COVID-19 antibody testing done at large scale is for detection of binding antibodies only and does not measure neutralizing antibodies.&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93; A neutralizing antibody (NAb) is an antibody that defends a cell from a pathogen or infectious particle by neutralizing any effect it has biologically. Neutralization renders the particle no longer infectious or pathogenic.&#91;54&#93; A binding antibody will bind to the pathogen but the pathogen remains infective; the purpose can be to flag the pathogen for destruction by the immune system.&#91;55&#93; It may even enhance infectivity by interacting with receptors on macrophages.&#91;56&#93; Since most COVID-19 antibody tests will return a positive result if they find only binding antibodies these tests cannot indicate that the person being tested has generated any NAbs which would give him or her protection against re-infection.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;
It is normally expected that if binding antibodies are detected the person also has generated NAbs&#91;53&#93; and for many viral diseases total antibody responses correlate somewhat with NAb responses&#91;57&#93; but this is not yet known for COVID-19. A study of 175 people in China who had recovered from COVID‑19 and had mild symptoms reported that 10 individuals had produced no detectable NAbs at the time of discharge, nor did they develop NAbs thereafter. How these patients recovered without the help of NAbs and whether they were at risk of re-infection of SARS-CoV-2 was left for further exploration.&#91;52&#93;&#91;58&#93; An additional source of uncertainty is that even if NAbs are present, several viruses, such as HIV, have evolved mechanisms to evade NAb responses. While this needs to be examined in the context of COVID-19 infection, past experiences with viral infection, in general, argue that in most recovered patients NAb level is a good indicator of protective immunity.&#91;51&#93;
The issue of NAbs was implicated when five sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) who tested positive went through two weeks of isolation, then tested negative twice, and thereafter again tested positive.&#91;59&#93; IgG antibodies normally peak around 28 days after the onset of infection&#91;46&#93; and the time frame of these events is not available.
It is presumed that once a person has been infected his or her chance of getting a second infection two to three months later is low, but how long that protective immunity might last is not known.&#91;52&#93; One study determined that reinfection at 29 days post-infection could not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques.&#91;60&#93; Studies have indicated that NAbs to the original SARS virus (the predecessor to the current SARS-CoV-2) can remain active in most people for two years&#91;61&#93; and are gone after six years.&#91;62&#93; Nevertheless, memory cells including Memory B cells and Memory T cells&#91;63&#93; can last much longer and may have the ability to greatly lessen the severity of a reinfection.&#91;62&#93;
A PoCT being performed in Peru. A blood droplet is collected by a pipette.
Blood from pipette is then placed onto a COVID-19 rapid diagnostic test device.
The rapid diagnostic test shows reactions of IgG and IgM antibodies.
According to epidemiologists, as lockdown measures are being relaxed effective containment of the pandemic in the United States will not be possible until all infected people can be rapidly located and isolated before they have a chance to infect others, and this will require widespread testing of people before they even begin to show symptoms.&#91;72&#93; The contagiousness of a disease is indicated by the basic reproduction number (R0) of the disease. The R0 (pronounced "R naught")&#91;73&#93; of SARS-CoV-2 in general is thought to be from 2.2 to 2.5,&#91;74&#93;&#91;75&#93; meaning that in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection, each infected person is expected to infect 2.2 to 2.5 other people.&#91;76&#93; However this can vary from location to location.&#91;77&#93; In New York state the R0 is 3.4 to 3.8.&#91;78&#93; One factor that increases the difficulty of blocking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is that, on average, an infected person begins showing symptoms five days after becoming infected (the "incubation period") and begins infecting others two to three days before symptoms appear.&#91;74&#93;&#91;79&#93; According to a recent study, an estimated 44% of viral transmissions occur within this period.&#91;74&#93;&#91;80&#93; In addition to this, a significant number of infected people never show symptoms but are nevertheless contagious.&#91;80&#93;&#91;75&#93; Therefore, if transmission of this disease is to be blocked effectively, people must be tested and isolated before they begin to show symptoms.
According to Harvard's Global Health Institute, the U.S. should be doing more than 900,000 tests per day as a country.&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93; Other organizations have given varying estimates of up to 23 ;million tests per day.&#91;83&#93;&#91;84&#93;&#91;85&#93;&#91;86&#93; For the week ending 30 May there were an average of 387,000 tests per day in the United States.&#91;87&#93; According to the World Health Organization if more than 10% of the tests given are coming back positive then not enough testing is being done.&#91;88&#93; How close each state is to the minimum number of tests it should be performing according to the Harvard Global Health Institute estimate, and to the 10% target, as of 6 ;May, is shown here.
According to some epidemiologists, this huge increase in testing will require that states build a much-expanded testing infrastructure. This would include mobile testing programs and neighborhood testing sites, allowing special attention to be given to high-risk groups such as those in long term-care facilities; the homeless and those working in shelters; employees in high-density workplaces; and anyone who has had close contact with a known COVID-19 patient. Such people would be tested every five days.&#91;72&#93;
Paul Romer believes the U.S. already has the technical capacity to scale up to 20 ;million tests per day, which is his estimate as to the number that will be necessary to fully remobilize the economy.&#91;84&#93; The Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics estimated on 4 April that this capacity could be available by late July if the necessary steps were taken.&#91;89&#93; Romer points to the Single-molecule real-time sequencing equipment from Pacific Biosciences, which is in use in 20 laboratories in the U.S.&#91;90&#93;&#91;84&#93; and to the Ion Torrent Next-Generation Sequencing equipment from ThermoFisher Scientific, which is in use in 16 laboratories in the U.S.&#91;91&#93;&#91;84&#93; According to Romer, "Recent research papers suggest that any one of these has the potential to scale up to millions of tests per day." He adds that this plan would also require removing restrictive regulatory hurdles managed by the FDA. Romer estimates that this amount of testing would require that the Congress allocate $100 ;billion to generate a revenue stream for labs to rapidly expand testing capability.&#91;84&#93;
Also according to Paul Romer, even a relatively inaccurate test, if administered frequently enough, can produce successful results. He ran simulations in which 7% of the population is tested every day with a test that has a 20% false negative rate (20% of the people who are actually infected will get a negative test result because of a bad swab or a very low level of virus in the early stage of infection) and a 1% false positive rate. The average person would be tested roughly every two weeks and those who tested positive would go into quarantine. Romer concluded that the fraction of the population that is currently infected (known as the attack rate) peaks early, reaching roughly 8% of the population in about thirty days and then gradually declines, in most runs reaching zero at 500 days, with the cumulative fraction of the population that is ultimately infected kept below 20%. Romer adds that these results are indicative, not predictive about the true behavior of the spread of the virus, and should not be taken as being something one can rely on.&#91;92&#93;
After issues with testing accuracy and capacity during January and February, the United States was conducting an average of 363,000 tests per day for the week ending 17 May.&#91;87&#93;&#91;94&#93; In comparison, several European countries have been conducting more daily tests per capita than the United States.&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93; Three European countries are aiming to conduct 100,000 tests per day—Germany by mid-April, the United Kingdom by the end of April and France by the end of June. Germany has a large medical diagnostics industry, with more than a hundred testing labs that provided the technology and infrastructure to enable rapid increases in testing. The UK sought to diversify its life sciences companies into diagnostics to scale up testing capacity.&#91;97&#93;
By the start of April, the United Kingdom was delivering around 10,000 swab tests per day. It set a target for 100,000 per day by the end of April, eventually rising to 250,000 tests per day.&#91;97&#93; The British NHS has announced that it is piloting a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of a patient infecting others if they come to a hospital or having to disinfect an ambulance if one is used.&#91;103&#93;
In drive-through testing for COVID‑19 for suspected cases, a healthcare professional takes sample using appropriate precautions.&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93; Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest, most-extensive testing of any country.&#91;106&#93; Hong Kong has set up a scheme where suspected patients can stay home, "[the] emergency department will give a specimen tube to the patient", they spit into it, send it back and get a test result a while after.&#91;107&#93;
In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample is found to be positive.&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93; Pool testing was then adopted in Israel, Germany, South Korea,&#91;111&#93; and Nebraska,&#91;112&#93; and the Indian states Uttar Pradesh,&#91;113&#93; West Bengal,&#91;114&#93; Punjab,&#91;115&#93; Chhattisgarh,&#91;116&#93; and Maharashtra.&#91;117&#93;
In Wuhan a makeshift 2000-sq-meter emergency detection laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Chinese&#58; 火眼, "Fire Eye") was opened on 5 ;February 2020 by BGI,&#91;118&#93;&#91;119&#93; which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.&#91;120&#93;&#91;119&#93; With the construction overseen by BGI-founder Wang Jian and taking 5-days,&#91;121&#93; modelling has show cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of tackling the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had not come into operation.&#91;citation needed&#93; The Wuhan Laboratory has been promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China. By 4 ;March the daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day.&#91;122&#93;
Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays have been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 assays.&#91;123&#93; These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent has become a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU and UK&#91;124&#93; and the U.S.&#91;125&#93;&#91;126&#93; This has led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 ;°C (208 ;°F) for five minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.&#91;127&#93;&#91;128&#93;
On 31 March it was announced United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and was on track to scale up the level of testing to reach the bulk of the population.&#91;129&#93; This was through a combination of drive-through capability, and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China). Constructed in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to be operational outside of China.&#91;130&#93;
On 8 April 2020, In India, the Supreme Court of India ruled that private labs should be reimbursed at the appropriate time for COVID-19 tests&#91;131&#93; However private labs have stated that they are unable to scale up the testing because of the price cap put on the testing and labs being forced to make advance payment to suppliers while they receive deferred payment from hospitals.&#91;132&#93;
University of California San Francisco conducted PCR tests of 1,845 people in Bolinas, California on 20–24 April, almost the entire town. No active infections were detected. Antibody testing was also performed but the results are not yet available.&#91;133&#93;
In a Stanford study led by Jay Bhattacharya, an antibody test was conducted on 5,603 major league baseball employees and 0.7% tested positive, showing they had been infected in the past. 70% of those who tested positive had had no symptoms.&#91;134&#93;&#91;135&#93;&#91;136&#93;
Different testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own. The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not available until 28 January, delaying available tests in the U.S.&#91;138&#93;
China&#91;139&#93; and the United States&#91;140&#93; had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia&#91;141&#93; were unable to supply enough kits to satisfy demand and recommendations for testing by health experts. In contrast, experts say South Korea's broad availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus. Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government.&#91;142&#93; On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for ramping up the testing programmes as the best way to slow the advance of COVID‑19 pandemic.&#91;143&#93;&#91;144&#93;
High demand for testing due to wide spread of the virus caused backlogs of hundreds of thousands of tests at private U.S. labs, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents became strained.&#91;145&#93; On 25 May 2020, the U.S. federal government released details on testing that required each state to be responsible for carrying out its own planning and supply needs, which it said would be sufficiently address capacity issues. The proposal was panned for creating competition amongst the states to navigate national and international supply chains.&#91;146&#93;
All tests that have received an Emergency Use Authorization are listed at the FDA website. PCR-based and isothermal nucleic amplification tests are listed with “Molecular” in the technology column. Antibody tests are listed with “Serology” as the technology.
Some community-based testing sites in the United States are listed at the HHS website. Additional testing sites can be found here as well as at state and local health department websites. Nearby testing sites can also be located on Apple maps&#91;147&#93; and Google maps&#91;148&#93; by searching for "COVID-19 test".
When scientists from China first released information on the COVID‑19 viral genome on 11 January 2020, the Malaysian Institute for Medical Research (IMR) successfully produced the "primers and probes" specific to SARS-CoV-2 on the very same day. The IMR's laboratory in Kuala Lumpur had initiated early preparedness by setting up reagents to detect coronavirus using the RT-PCR method.&#91;149&#93; The WHO reagent sequence (primers and probes) released several days later was very similar to that produced in the IMR's laboratory, which was used to diagnose Malaysia's first COVID‑19 patient on 24 January 2020.&#91;150&#93;
Public Health England developed a test by 10 January,&#91;151&#93; using real-time RT-PCR (RdRp gene) assay based on oral swabs.&#91;152&#93; The test detected the presence of any type of coronavirus including specifically identifying SARS-CoV-2. It was rolled out to twelve laboratories across the United Kingdom on 10 February.&#91;153&#93; Another early PCR test was developed by Charité in Berlin, working with academic collaborators in Europe and Hong Kong, and published on 23 January. It used rtRT-PCR, and formed the basis of 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).&#91;154&#93; The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) approved by Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) on 4 ;February 2020.&#91;155&#93; It looks for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.&#91;156&#93;
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.&#91;157&#93;
In the United States, the CDC distributed its SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health labs through the International Reagent Resource.&#91;158&#93; One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits caused inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and a bottleneck of testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout the whole of February 2020. Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was not until then that state and local laboratories were permitted to begin testing.&#91;159&#93; The test was approved by the FDA under an EUA.&#91;citation needed&#93;
U.S. commercial labs began testing in early March 2020. As of 5 March LabCorp announced nationwide availability of COVID‑19 testing based on RT-PCR.&#91;160&#93; Quest Diagnostics similarly made nationwide COVID‑19 testing available as of 9 ;March.&#91;161&#93;
In Russia, the first COVID‑19 test was developed by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR, production began on 24 January.&#91;162&#93; On 11 February 2020 the test was approved by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.&#91;163&#93;
On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID‑19 infection.&#91;164&#93;
On 18 March 2020, the FDA issued EUA to Abbott Laboratories&#91;165&#93; for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic,&#91;166&#93; LabCorp,&#91;165&#93; and Thermo Fisher Scientific.&#91;167&#93; On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received an EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes on its GeneXpert system; the same system that runs the GeneXpert MTB/RIF.&#91;168&#93;&#91;169&#93;
On 13 April, Health Canada approved a test from Spartan Bioscience. Institutions may "test patients" with a handheld DNA analyzer "and receive results without having to send samples away to a [central] lab".&#91;170&#93;&#91;171&#93;
On 27 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for a test by Abbott Laboratories, called ID Now COVID-19, that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.&#91;172&#93; The assay amplifies a unique region of the virus's RdRp gene; the resulting copies are then detected with "fluorescently-labeled molecular beacons".&#91;173&#93; The test kit uses the company's "toaster-size" ID Now device which costs $12,000-$15,000.&#91;174&#93; The device can be used in laboratories or in patient care settings, and provides results in 13 minutes or less.&#91;173&#93; As of 28 March 2020, there were 18,000 ID Now devices in the U.S. and Abbott began manufacturing for 50,000 test kits per day.&#91;175&#93;
All visitors to U.S. President Donald Trump are required to undergo the test on site at the White House.&#91;176&#93;
On 8 May 2020, the FDA granted the first Emergency Use Authorization for a COVID-19 antigen test: "Sofia ;2 SARS Antigen FIA" by Quidel Corp.&#91;177&#93;&#91;39&#93; It is a lateral flow test which uses monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus's nucleocapsid (N) protein.&#91;178&#93; The result of the test is read out by the company's Sofia ;2 device using immunofluorescence.&#91;178&#93; The test, simpler and cheaper but less accurate than available PCR tests, can be used in laboratories or in patient care settings and gives results in 15 minutes.&#91;177&#93; A negative test result may occur if the level of antigen in a sample is below the detection limit of the test and should be confirmed with an RT-PCR test.&#91;178&#93;
As of 4 May, eleven tests had been approved for diagnosis in the United States, all under FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).&#91;179&#93; The tests are listed and described at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Other tests have been approved in other countries.&#91;180&#93;
In the United States, as of 28 April, Quest Diagnostics made a COVID-19 antibody test available for purchase to the general public through the QuestDirect service. Cost of the test is approximately US$130. The test requires the individual to visit a Quest Diagnostics location for a blood draw. Results are available days later.&#91;181&#93; An antibody test is also available through LabCorp.
A number of countries are beginning large scale surveys of their populations using these tests.&#91;182&#93;&#91;183&#93; A study in California conducted antibody testing in one county and estimated that the number of coronaviruses cases was between 2.5 and 4.2% of the population, or 50 to 85 times higher than the number of confirmed cases.&#91;184&#93;&#91;185&#93;
In late March 2020, a number of companies received European approvals for their test kits. The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours. The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.&#91;186&#93;
In May 2020, Roche received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a selective ELISA serology test to detect COVID-19 antibodies.&#91;187&#93;&#91;188&#93;&#91;189&#93;&#91;190&#93;
As of 7 April 2020, the WHO had accepted two diagnostic tests for procurement under the Emergency Use Listing procedure (EUL) for use during the COVID‑19 pandemic, in order to increase access to quality-assured, accurate tests for the disease.&#91;192&#93; Both in vitro diagnostics, the tests are genesig Real-Time PCR Coronavirus (COVID‑19) manufactured by Primerdesign, and cobas SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative assay for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems by Roche Molecular Systems. Approval means these tests can also be supplied by the United Nations and other procurement agencies supporting the COVID‑19 response.&#91;clarification needed&#93;
RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for COVID-19 and other viruses.&#91;139&#93; Although it has high sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, in one study the sensitivity dropped to 66-88% clinically.&#91;194&#93; Most experts believe improper sample collection, exemplified by failure to acquire enough sample and failure to insert a swab deep into the nose, are to blame for the low clinical sensitivity. The time course of infection also affects the accuracy, for being too late or too early to be tested can lead to a viral load that is too low to be detected, whereas RNA breakdown due to improper storage for too long time could also lead to wrong results.&#91;195&#93; In one study a positive test result was highest at week one (100%), followed by 89.3%, 66.1%, 32.1%, 5.4% and zero by week six.&#91;196&#93;&#91;197&#93;
Early in March 2020, China has been reporting the problems with accuracy in their test kits.&#91;139&#93; A paper published in JAMA researched the RT-PCR sensitivity for COVID-19 in 1070 samples from 205 Wuhan patients, shows a varied sensitivity according to the methods and location of sample collection, where samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens tested with the highest sensitivity for COVID-19.&#91;193&#93; The authors argued that CT scan shows a higher sensitivity for testing for COVID-19.&#91;198&#93; Spain purchased test kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that results were inaccurate. The firm explained that the incorrect results may be a result of a failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly. The Spanish ministry said it will withdraw the kits that returned incorrect results, and would replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.&#91;199&#93;
Different test kits also shows inconsistent sensitivity. According to a Dutch CDC-led laboratory investigation comparing 7 PCR test kits from different countries,&#91;200&#93; test kits made by BGI from Shenzhen, China, shows the highest sensitivity compared to the test kits from other countries.&#91;201&#93; The test kits with the highest sensitivity, including those from R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene, are recommended to diagnose people with low viral loads, while all the other test kits are still satisfying when used for those routine diagnostics of symptomatic patients, according to the research.&#91;200&#93; In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws;" the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.&#91;140&#93;
In a study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic, the ID Now COVID-19 test detected the virus in only 85.2% of the samples that contained it. According to the director of the study a test should be at least 95% reliable. Abbott said the issue could have been caused by storing the samples in a special solution instead of inserting them directly into the testing machine.&#91;202&#93; Another study, by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center, concluded that the machine was unacceptable in their clinical setting as it missed too many infections.&#91;203&#93; The FDA announced on 14 May that they have received and are reviewing 15 adverse event reports about the Abbott ID Now device that suggest some users are receiving inaccurate negative results.&#91;204&#93;
The test results from some of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 antibody tests can be viewed at the FDA website.
Antibody tests have a low positive predictive value (PPV) when the prevalence in the population of people with antibodies is low. For example, suppose there is a population in which 5% of the people have at some point been infected and so should test positive for antibodies. Select 100 people at random and administer an antibody test that has a specificity of 95%, meaning that 5 people who are actually negative will be expected to test positive.  Since 5% of the people actually do have antibodies those five people will also test positive giving us 10 people testing positive, with an incorrect result being returned for half of them. So even though the specificity of the test is high, the PPV of the test in this population is only 50%,&#91;205&#93; and a person would receive as much assurance that he is actually positive by flipping a coin. However, the odds can be improved. In this situation conducting a second independent test in sequence when the first test yields a positive result will increase the PPV to 94.5%, meaning that only about 5% of those testing positive would receive an incorrect result.&#91;206&#93; A person could also increase the odds by using a test having a higher specificity. In this population a test with a specificity of 99% would yield a PPV of 84%.&#91;207&#93; If the prevalence of antibodies in the population is 52% a test with a specificity of 95% will yield a PPV greater than 95%.&#91;206&#93; In a low-prevalence setting the negative predictive value (NPV) of a test increases.&#91;206&#93; The actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive individuals in the U.S. population is not currently known.&#91;207&#93; The test results at the FDA website list the PPV and NPV for each test assuming a prevalence of antibodies in the population of 5%.&#91;207&#93; Antibody survey results from various tests have found that from 2% to 30% of the populations tested have COVID-19 antibodies.&#91;208&#93; The World Health Organization, on preliminary data, concluded that 2% to 3% of the world's population has developed antibodies.&#91;209&#93;
Nearly two million antibody tests imported into Australia and costing $20 ;million were declared unusable.&#91;210&#93;&#91;211&#93;&#91;212&#93; 80% of test kits for COVID-19 blood antibody that the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong results.&#91;213&#93;&#91;214&#93; Slovakia purchased 1.2 ;million antibody-based test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate.&#91;215&#93; China accused the Czech Republic and Slovakia of incorrect use of antibody-based tests, after Slovakian Prime Minister said the kits should be "dumped into the Danube".&#91;216&#93; Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the antibody-based test kits Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use".&#91;217&#93;&#91;218&#93; The UK purchased 3.5 ;million antibody test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced these were not usable.&#91;219&#93;&#91;220&#93;&#91;221&#93; On 21 April 2020, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has advised Indian states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits purchased from China after receiving complaints from one state. Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma on 21 April said the kits gave only 5.4 percent accurate results against the expectation of 90 percent accuracy.&#91;222&#93; The Chinese embassy in India described the decision to oust Chinese test kits to be "unfair and irresponsible" and "look at issues with pre-emptive prejudice" when responding to ICMR's decision, and explained that antibody tests are only for "surveillance purposes".&#91;223&#93;
The WHO recommends countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID‑19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID‑19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.&#91;224&#93;&#91;225&#93; Out of the sixteen reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.&#91;226&#93;
Testing, followed with quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those with whom the SARS-CoV-2 positive people had had contact, resulted in positive outcomes.&#91;clarification needed&#93;.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vò, the site of the first COVID‑19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart. About half the people testing positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined. With travel to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.&#91;227&#93;
With aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore has proceeded much more slowly than in other developed countries&#91;dubious&#32; &#8211; discuss&#93;, but without extreme restrictions like forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments. Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after holiday break on 23 March,&#91;242&#93; even though schools did close moving to "full home-based learning" on 8 ;April.&#91;243&#93;
On 27 April, Russia tested 3 ;million people and had 183,000 people under medical supervision because they were suspected of having the virus&#91;244&#93; with 87,147 people having tested positive for the virus and total confirmed deaths at 794.&#91;245&#93; On 28 April Anna Popova head of Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare (Roszdravnadzor) in a presidential update said there were now 506 laboratories testing; 45% of those tested positive had no symptoms; incidence of pneumonia reduced from 25% to 20%; and only 5% of patients had a severe form. 40% of infections were from family members. The speed of people reporting illness has improved from six days to the day people find symptoms. Antibody testing was carried out on 3,200 Moscow doctors and 20% have immunity.&#91;246&#93;
After 94% of the 4,800 crew had been tested, roughly 60 percent of the 600-plus sailors who tested positive did not have symptoms.&#91;252&#93; Sailors who test positive must spend at least two weeks in isolation and then test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day. Five sailors who went through this process and had been admitted back onto the ship subsequently developed flu-like symptoms and again tested positive.&#91;59&#93;
Several other countries, such as Iceland&#91;253&#93; and South Korea,&#91;254&#93; have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs. A statistical study has found that countries that have tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild or no symptoms.&#91;6&#93; A subsequent study has also found that countries that have tested more widely also have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.&#91;255&#93;
A test which uses monoclonal antibodies which bind to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the SARS-CoV-2 is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid influenza test.&#91;256&#93; The World Health Organization raised concerns on 8 ;April that these tests need to be validated for the disease and are in a research stage only.&#91;257&#93; The United States Food and Drug Administration approved an antibody test on 2 ;April,&#91;258&#93; but some researchers warn that such tests should not drive public health decisions unless the percentage of COVID‑19 survivors who are producing neutralizing antibodies is also known.&#91;48&#93;
The figures are influenced by the country's testing policy. If two countries are alike in every respect, including having the same spread of infection, and one of them has a shortage of testing capability, it may test only those showing symptoms while the other country having greater access to testing may test both those showing symptoms and others chosen at random. The country that tests only people showing symptoms will have a higher figure for "% (Confirmed cases as percentage of tested samples or tested cases)" than the country that also tests people chosen at random.&#91;259&#93; If two countries are alike in every respect, including which people they test, the one that tests more people will have a higher "Confirmed / million people".

This article lists the pages containing the chronology and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2,&#91;1&#93; the virus which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. At this stage it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.&#91;2&#93; Furthermore, some developments may become known or fully understood only in retrospect.

As of 09:19 UTC on 3 June 2020, a total of 6,395,328 cases are confirmed in more than 227 countries&#91;4&#93; and 26 cruise ships.&#91;5&#93; There are 3,272,442 active cases and 380,580 deaths.&#91;4&#93;
According to Michael Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, early detection is vital because the continent's health systems "are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks".&#91;290&#93;&#91;291&#93; Advisers say that a strategy based on testing could allow African countries to minimise lockdowns that inflict enormous hardship on those who depend on income earned day by day to be able to feed themselves and their families. Even in the best scenario, the United Nations says 74 ;million test kits and 30,000 ventilators will be needed by the continent's 1.3 ;billion people in 2020.&#91;292&#93;  Most of the reported cases are from six countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria, but it is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in other African countries with poorer health care systems.&#91;293&#93; Cases have been confirmed in all African countries, with Lesotho the last country to report its first coronavirus case on 13 May 2020.&#91;294&#93; There have been no reported cases in the British Overseas Territories of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.&#91;295&#93;
As of 2 May, Antarctica is the only continent not reached by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#91;296&#93;&#91;297&#93;
A cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan and eventually spread to the rest of China. Afterwards, many other Asian countries started to confirm cases, with some of the most affected countries being South Korea, Turkey and Iran. A number of countries such as India and Malaysia also experience a surge in cases following religious gathering events in those countries. As of 30 April, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for North Korea and Turkmenistan, both of which have suspected cases. The lack of cases in North Korea is disputed, given its shared border with China, while concerns have been raised about the ability for its health system to cope.&#91;297&#93; There have been no reported cases in the Australian external territories of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands.&#91;299&#93;&#91;300&#93;
A small number of initial cases in Europe were reported in France, Germany and other countries. On 21 February, a large outbreak was reported in Italy, mostly in the north near Milan. Cases grew rapidly as the outbreak spread across Europe. Cases have been reported in all European countries after Montenegro reported a case on 17 March, and in almost all European territories after the Isle of Man on 19 March, the disputed state of Transnistria on 21 March&#91;301&#93; and Åland Islands on 22 March reported cases. No cases have been reported in Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands.&#91;297&#93; The WHO declared Europe as the new center of the virus after the situation improved in China.&#91;302&#93;
The first cases in North America were reported in the United States in January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on 16 April.&#91;303&#93;
On 26 March 2020, the U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, with over 82,000 cases.&#91;304&#93; On 11 April 2020, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths.&#91;305&#93; As of 15 May 2020 the total cases of COVID-19 were 1,571,908 with 95,764 total deaths.&#91;306&#93;
Canada reported 60,616 cases and 3,842 deaths on 4 May,&#91;307&#93; while Mexico reported 23,471 cases and 2,154 deaths.&#91;308&#93; The Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba are the only Caribbean countries reporting more than 1,000 cases (16,908, 2,507 and 2,092 respectively), while Panama and Honduras led Central America with 14,095 and 5,527 cases, respectively.&#91;309&#93;
The first confirmed case was in Melbourne, Victoria on 25 January.&#91;310&#93; Many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As of 3 June 2020,&#91;311&#93; no cases have been reported in the sovereign states of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.&#91;297&#93; No cases have been reported in the territories of American Samoa (territory of the United States), Christmas Island (external territory of Australia), the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (external territory of Australia), the Cook Islands (associated state of New Zealand), Niue (associated state of New Zealand), Norfolk Island (external territory of Australia), the Pitcairn Islands (British Overseas Territory), Tokelau (territory of New Zealand), and Wallis and Futuna (French overseas collectivity).
As of 5 May, 8,227 cases have been reported in Oceania; the five countries reporting the most cases are: Australia (6,825), New Zealand (1,137), Guam (149), French Polynesia (58), and Fiji (18). 122 deaths have been reported in the region: Australia (95), New Zealand (20), Guam (5), and Northern Mariana Islands (2).&#91;312&#93;
As of 19 March, cases have been confirmed in all South American countries. Cases were confirmed in all South American territories, as cases were confirmed in the Falkland Islands on 3 ;April.
The coronavirus was first reported in South America on 26 February when Brazil confirmed a case in São Paulo. Since then, governments across the region have taken an array of actions to protect their citizens and contain the spread of COVID-19.&#91;313&#93; Brazil reported 100,000 cases of infection and 7,000 deaths on 3 May,&#91;314&#93; becoming the country with the ninth highest number of cases in the world. As of 22 May, Brazil is the second country in the rank.
The other South American countries with the highest number of cases are Peru (108,928), Ecuador (29,538), Chile (31,663), Colombia (7,668), Argentina (4,783), and Bolivia (1,594).&#91;309&#93; Bouvet Island and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have not reported any cases as of 2 May.&#91;297&#93;
The outbreak spread to several cruise ships including the Diamond Princess, the Grand Princess, the World Dream, the MS Westerdam and the MS Braemar.&#91;315&#93;&#91;316&#93;&#91;317&#93;&#91;318&#93;&#91;excessive citations&#93;
Cruise operators have either cancelled or changed their itineraries as countries across the world implement travel restrictions to curb the disease. Ports are refusing to accept cruise ships that have either been to Chinese ports or are carrying Chinese passengers.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which represents 90% of cruise operators, announced the various precautionary measures being implemented by its members. All passengers who have traveled to or visited/transited through China (including Hong Kong and Macau) within 14 days before embarkation will be denied entry into cruise ships. Any persons in close contact with either suspected or diagnosed cases of coronavirus infection will also be denied entry.&#91;319&#93;
Below is a list of countries and territories with no confirmed cases of COVID-19, in order of greatest population.
As of May 2020, 12 sovereign states (10 in Oceania and 2 in Asia) have not confirmed any cases of COVID-19. Below is a list of these countries, ordered by population.



This is a list of notable people who have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result of infection by the virus SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., trading as SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles and the Dragon spacecraft.
SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 in 2008),&#91;11&#93; the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragon in 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012),&#91;12&#93; the first propulsive landing for an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), the first private company to launch an object into orbit around the Sun (Falcon Heavy's payload of a Tesla Roadster in 2018), and the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station (Dragon 2 in 2020).&#91;13&#93; SpaceX has flown 20&#91;14&#93; resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS) under a partnership with NASA.&#91;15&#93; NASA also awarded SpaceX a further development contract in 2011 to develop and demonstrate a human-rated Dragon, which would be used to transport astronauts to the ISS and return them safely to Earth.&#91;16&#93;&#91;self-published source?&#93; SpaceX conducted the maiden launch of its Dragon 2 spacecraft on a NASA-required demonstration flight (Crew Dragon Demo-1) on March 2, 2019, and launched its first crewed Dragon 2 on May 30, 2020.&#91;13&#93;
In December 2015, a Falcon 9 accomplished a propulsive vertical landing. This was the first such achievement by a rocket for orbital spaceflight.&#91;17&#93; In April 2016, with the launch of CRS-8, SpaceX successfully vertically landed the first stage on an ocean drone ship landing platform.&#91;18&#93; In May 2016, in another first, SpaceX again landed the first stage, but during a significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit mission.&#91;19&#93; In March 2017, SpaceX became the first to successfully re-launch and land the first stage of an orbital rocket.&#91;20&#93; In January 2020, with the third launch of the Starlink project, SpaceX became the largest commercial satellite constellation operator in the world.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;
In September 2016, Musk unveiled the Interplanetary Transport System, a privately funded launch system to develop spaceflight technology for use in crewed interplanetary spaceflight. In 2018, Musk unveiled an updated configuration of the system, Starship, which is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle after the early 2020s, as SpaceX has announced it intends to eventually replace its existing Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon 2 fleet with Starship, even in the Earth-orbit satellite delivery market.&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;:24:50–27:05  Starship is planned to be fully reusable and will be the largest rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;
In early 2002, Musk was seeking staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of Propulsion). Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.&#91;38&#93; SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. The company grew rapidly, from 160 employees in November 2005 to 1,100 in 2010,&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; 3,800 employees and contractors by October 2013,&#91;41&#93; nearly 5,000 by late 2015,&#91;42&#93;&#91;43&#93; and about 6,000 in April 2017.&#91;44&#93; As of November ;2017&#91;update&#93;, the company had grown to nearly 7,000.&#91;45&#93; In 2016, Musk gave a speech at the International Astronautical Congress, where he explained that the US government regulates rocket technology as an "advanced weapon technology", making it difficult to hire non-Americans.&#91;46&#93;
As of March 2018, SpaceX had over 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12 ;billion in contract revenue.&#91;47&#93; The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.&#91;48&#93; In late 2013, space industry media quoted Musk's comments on SpaceX "forcing… increased competitiveness in the launch industry", its major competitors in the commercial comsat launch market being Arianespace, United Launch Alliance, and International Launch Services.&#91;49&#93; At the same time, Musk also said that the increased competition would "be a good thing for the future of space". Currently, SpaceX is the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.&#91;50&#93;
On May 30, 2020, SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during SpaceX Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed launch from American soil in 9 years.&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93; The mission launched from Launch Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.&#91;53&#93; SpaceX Demo-2 successfully docked with the ISS on May 31, 2020.&#91;54&#93;  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic happening at the same time, proper quarantine procedures (many of which were already in use by NASA decades before the 2020 pandemic) were taken to prevent the astronauts from bringing COVID-19 aboard the ISS.&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93;
Musk has stated that one of his goals is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.&#91;57&#93; CEO Elon Musk said: "I believe $500 per pound ($1100/kg) or less is very achievable".&#91;58&#93; Musk has also stated that he wishes to make space travel available for "almost anyone."&#91;59&#93;
A major goal of SpaceX has been to develop a rapidly reusable launch system. As of March ;2013&#91;update&#93;, the publicly announced aspects of this technology development effort include an active test campaign of the low-altitude, low-velocity Grasshopper flight test vehicle,&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93; and a high-altitude, high-speed Falcon 9 post-mission booster return test campaign. In 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first orbital rocket stage on December 21.
In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,&#91;63&#93; and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, utilizing a small number of SpaceX employees,&#91;64&#93; which was completed in May 2018,&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93; and opened to the public in December 2018.&#91;67&#93; During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.&#91;67&#93;
At the 2016 International Astronautical Congress, Musk announced his plans to build large spaceships to reach Mars.&#91;68&#93; Using the Starship, Musk planned to send at least two unmanned cargo ships to Mars in 2022. The first missions would be used to seek out sources of water and build a propellant plant. Musk also planned to fly four additional ships to Mars in 2024 including the first people. From there, additional missions would work to establish a Mars colony.&#91;9&#93;&#91;69&#93; These goals are however facing delays.&#91;70&#93;
Musk's advocacy for the long-term settlement of Mars, goes far beyond what SpaceX projects to build;&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93; a successful colonization would ultimately involve many more economic actors—whether individuals, companies, or governments—to facilitate the growth of the human presence on Mars over many decades.&#91;74&#93;&#91;75&#93;&#91;76&#93;
Major achievements of SpaceX are in the reuse of orbital-class launch vehicles and cost reduction in the space launch industry. Most notable of these being the continued landings and relaunches of the first stage of Falcon 9. As of March 2020, SpaceX has used a single first-stage booster, B1048, at most five times. SpaceX is defined as a private space company and thus its achievements can also be counted as firsts by a private company.
Landmark achievements of SpaceX in chronological order include:&#91;77&#93;&#91;unreliable source?&#93;
In March 2013, a Dragon spacecraft in orbit developed issues with its thrusters that limited its control capabilities. SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages within a short period, and the spacecraft was able to successfully complete its mission to and from the International Space Station.
In late June 2015, CRS-7 launched a Cargo Dragon atop a Falcon 9 to resupply the International Space Station. All telemetry readings were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight when a loss of helium pressure was detected and a cloud of vapor appeared outside the second stage. A few seconds after this, the second stage exploded. The first stage continued to fly for a few seconds before disintegrating due to aerodynamic forces. The capsule was thrown off and survived the explosion, transmitting data until it was destroyed on impact.&#91;83&#93; Later it was revealed that the capsule could have landed intact if it had software to deploy its parachutes in case of a launch mishap.&#91;84&#93; The problem was discovered to be a failed 2-foot-long steel strut purchased from a supplier&#91;85&#93; to hold a helium pressure vessel that broke free due to the force of acceleration.&#91;86&#93; This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure. The Dragon software issue was also fixed in addition to an analysis of the entire program in order to ensure proper abort mechanisms are in place for future rockets and their payload.&#91;87&#93;
In early September 2016, a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launch static fire test.&#91;88&#93;&#91;89&#93; The payload, the Spacecom Amos-6 communications satellite valued at $200 ;million, was destroyed.&#91;90&#93; Musk described the event as the "most difficult and complex failure" in SpaceX's history; SpaceX reviewed nearly 3,000 channels of telemetry and video data covering a period of 35–55 milliseconds for the postmortem.&#91;91&#93; Musk reported that the explosion was caused by the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.&#91;92&#93; Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.&#91;93&#93;
On June 28, 2019, SpaceX announced that it had lost contact with three of the 60 satellites making up the Starlink megaconstellation. The dysfunctional satellites' orbits are expected to slowly decay until they disintegrate in the atmosphere.&#91;94&#93; However, the rate of failure for satellites in megaconstellations consisting of thousands of satellites has raised concerns that these constellations could litter the Earth's lower orbit, with serious detrimental consequences for future space flights.&#91;95&#93;
In January 2015, SpaceX raised US$1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately US$12 billion. Google and Fidelity joined prior investors Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93; In July 2017, the Company raised US$350 million at a valuation of US$21 billion.&#91;105&#93;
Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of "setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at substantially lower cost. According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost for both the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets was estimated at approximately US$390 million. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about US$4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.&#91;106&#93;
By March 2018, SpaceX had contracts for 100 launch missions, and each of those contracts provides down payments at contract signing, plus many are paying progress payments as launch vehicle components are built in advance of mission launch, driven in part by US accounting rules for recognizing long-term revenue.&#91;48&#93;
As of February ;2020&#91;update&#93;, SpaceX was raising an additional amount of about US$250 million through equity stock offerings. In May 2020, the company valuation reached US$36 billion.&#91;114&#93;
Falcon 1 was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms into low Earth orbit.&#91;115&#93; It functioned as an early test-bed for developing concepts and components for the larger Falcon 9.&#91;115&#93; Falcon 1 attempted five flights between 2006 and 2009. With Falcon I, when Musk announced his plans for it before a subcommittee in the Senate in 2004, he discussed that Falcon I would be the 'worlds only semi-reusable orbital rocket' apart from the Space Shuttle.&#91;116&#93; On September 28, 2008, on its fourth attempt, the Falcon 1 successfully reached orbit, becoming the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to do so.&#91;117&#93;
Falcon 9 is an EELV-class medium-lift vehicle capable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 ;lb) to orbit, and is intended to compete with the Delta IV and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nine Merlin engines in its first stage.&#91;118&#93; The Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 2010-06-04. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 2012-05-22, and was the first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station.&#91;119&#93; The vehicle was upgraded to Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9 Block 5 in 2018. As of 23 ;March ;2020&#91;update&#93;, the Falcon 9 family have flown 84 successful missions with one failure, one partial success, and one vehicle destroyed during a routine test several days prior to a scheduled launch.
In 2011, SpaceX began development of the Falcon Heavy, a heavy-lift rocket configured using a cluster of three Falcon 9 first stage cores with a total 27 Merlin 1D engines and propellant crossfeed.&#91;120&#93;&#91;121&#93; The Falcon Heavy successfully flew on its inaugural mission on February 6, 2018 with a payload consisting of Musk's personal Tesla Roadster into heliocentric orbit&#91;122&#93; The first stage would be capable of lifting 63,800 kilograms (140,660 ;lb) to LEO with the 27 Merlin 1D engines producing 22,819 kN of thrust at sea level, and 24,681 ;kN in space. At the time of its first launch, SpaceX described their Falcon Heavy as "the world's most powerful rocket in operation".&#91;123&#93;
Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed three families of rocket engines—Merlin and the retired Kestrel for launch vehicle propulsion, and the Draco control thrusters. SpaceX is currently developing two further rocket engines: SuperDraco and Raptor. SpaceX is currently the world's most prolific producer of liquid fuel rocket engines.&#91;124&#93; Merlin is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX for use on their launch vehicles. Merlin engines use LOX and RP-1 as propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse. The injector at the heart of Merlin is of the pintle type that was first used in the Apollo Program for the lunar module landing engine. Propellants are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbo-pump. Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine, and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine. It is built around the same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbo-pump, and is fed only by tank pressure. Its nozzle is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, is also radiatively cooled, and is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy. Both names for the Merlin and Kestrel engines are derived from species of North American falcons: the kestrel and the merlin.&#91;125&#93;
Draco engines are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines that utilize monomethyl hydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. Each Draco thruster generates 400 newtons (90 ;lbf) of thrust.&#91;126&#93; They are used as reaction control system (RCS) thrusters on the Dragon spacecraft.&#91;127&#93; SuperDraco engines are a much more powerful version of the Draco thrusters, which were initially meant to be used as landing and launch escape system engines on Dragon 2. The concept of using retro-rockets for landing was scrapped in 2017 when it was decided to perform a traditional parachute descent and splashdown at sea.&#91;128&#93; Raptor is a new family of methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle engines to be used in its future Starship launch system.&#91;129&#93; Development versions were test fired in late 2016.&#91;130&#93; On April 3, 2019, SpaceX conducted a successful static fire test in Texas on its Starhopper vehicle, which ignited the engine while the vehicle remained tethered to the ground.&#91;131&#93; On July 24, 2019, SpaceX conducted a successful test hop of 20 meters of its Starhopper.&#91;132&#93; On August 28, 2019, Starhopper conducted a successful test hop of 150 meters.&#91;133&#93;
In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade.&#91;134&#93; The Dragon is a conventional blunt-cone ballistic capsule which is capable of carrying cargo or up to seven astronauts into orbit and beyond.&#91;135&#93;&#91;135&#93; In 2006, NASA announced that the company was one of two selected to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the ISS under the COTS program.&#91;136&#93; SpaceX demonstrated cargo resupply and eventually crew transportation services using the Dragon.&#91;119&#93; The first flight of a Dragon structural test article took place in June 2010, from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station during the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle; the mock-up Dragon lacked avionics, heat shield, and other key elements normally required of a fully operational spacecraft but contained all the necessary characteristics to validate the flight performance of the launch vehicle.&#91;137&#93; An operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.&#91;138&#93; In 2012, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station,&#91;119&#93; and has since been conducting regular resupply services to the ISS.&#91;139&#93;
In April 2011, NASA issued a $75 ;million contract, as part of its second-round commercial crew development (CCDev) program, for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.&#91;140&#93; In August 2012, NASA awarded SpaceX a firm, fixed-price SAA with the objective of producing a detailed design of the entire crew transportation system. This contract includes numerous key technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions following system certification.&#91;141&#93; The fully autonomous Crew Dragon spacecraft is expected to be one of the safest crewed spacecraft systems. Reusable in nature, the Crew Dragon will offer savings to NASA.&#91;141&#93; SpaceX conducted a test of an empty Crew Dragon to ISS in early 2019, and later in the year they plan to launch a crewed Dragon which will send US astronauts to the ISS for the first time since the retirement of the Space Shuttle.&#91;142&#93;&#91;143&#93; In February 2017, SpaceX announced that two would-be space tourists had put down "significant deposits" for a mission which would see the two tourists fly on board a Dragon capsule around the Moon and back again.
In addition to SpaceX's privately funded plans for an eventual Mars mission, NASA Ames Research Center had developed a concept called Red Dragon: a low-cost Mars mission that would use Falcon Heavy as the launch vehicle and trans-Martian injection vehicle, and the Dragon capsule to enter the Martian atmosphere. The concept was originally envisioned for launch in 2018 as a NASA Discovery mission, then alternatively for 2022.&#91;144&#93; The objectives of the mission would be return the samples from Mars to Earth at a fraction of the cost of the NASA own return-sample mission now projected at 6 ;billion dollars.&#91;144&#93;&#91;145&#93; In September 2017, Elon Musk released first prototype images of their space suits to be used in future missions. The suit is in testing phase and it is designed to cope with 2 ;atm (200 ;kPa; 29 ;psi) pressure in vacuum.&#91;146&#93;&#91;147&#93; The Crew Dragon spacecraft was first sent to space on March 2, 2019.
On March 27, 2020, SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL resupply spacecraft to carry pressurized and unpressurized cargo, experiments and other supplies to NASA's planned Lunar Gateway under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) contract.&#91;148&#93; The equipment delivered by Dragon XL missions could include sample collection materials, spacesuits and other items astronauts may need on the Gateway and on the surface of the Moon, according to NASA. It will launch on SpaceX Falcon Heavy rockets from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Dragon XL will stay at the Gateway for six to 12 months at a time, when research payloads inside and outside the cargo vessel could be operated remotely, even when crews are not present.&#91;149&#93; Its payload capacity is expected to be more than 5,000 kilograms (11,000 ;lb) to lunar orbit.&#91;150&#93;
SpaceX is actively pursuing several different research and development programs. Most notable are those intended to develop a fully reusable launch vehicle called Starship and a global telecommunications network called Starlink.
SpaceX's reusable launcher program was publicly announced in 2011 and the design phase was completed in February 2012. The system returns the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket to a predetermined landing site using only its own propulsion systems.&#91;151&#93;
SpaceX's active test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology. The prototypes of Falcon 9 performed vertical takeoffs and landings.
High-velocity, high-altitude aspects of the booster atmospheric return technology began testing in late 2013 and have continued through 2018, with a 98% success rate to date. As a result of Elon Musk's goal of crafting more cost-effective launch vehicles, SpaceX conceived a method to reuse the first stage of their primary rocket, the Falcon 9,&#91;152&#93; by attempting propulsive vertical landings on solid surfaces. Once the company determined that soft landings were feasible by touching down over the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, they began landing attempts on a solid platform. SpaceX leased and modified several barges to sit out at sea as a target for the returning first stage, converting them to autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS). SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015,&#91;153&#93; and in April 2016, the first stage booster first successfully landed on the ASDS Of Course I Still Love You.&#91;154&#93;&#91;155&#93;
SpaceX continues to carry out first stage landings on every orbital launch that fuel margins allow. By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a ten percent price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.&#91;156&#93; On March 30, 2017, SpaceX launched a "flight-proven" Falcon 9 for the SES-10 mission. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.&#91;78&#93;&#91;157&#93; The first stage was recovered and landed on the ASDS Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket. Elon Musk called the achievement an "incredible milestone in the history of space."&#91;158&#93;&#91;159&#93;
The autonomous spaceport drone ships are named after giant starships from the Culture series stories by science fiction author Iain M. Banks.&#91;160&#93;
SpaceX is developing a super-heavy lift launch system, Starship. Starship is a fully reusable second stage and space vehicle intended to replace all of the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s; plus ground infrastructure for rapid launch and relaunch and zero-gravity propellant transfer technology in low Earth orbit (LEO).
SpaceX initially envisioned a 12-meter-diameter ITS concept in 2016 which was solely aimed at Mars transit and other interplanetary uses. In 2017, SpaceX articulated a smaller 9-meter-diameter BFR to replace all of SpaceX launch service provider capabilities—Earth-orbit, lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and potentially, even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth—but do so on a fully reusable set of vehicles with a markedly lower cost structure.&#91;161&#93; A large portion of the components on Starship are made of 301 stainless steel. Private passenger Yusaku Maezawa has contracted to fly around the Moon in Starship in 2023.&#91;162&#93;&#91;163&#93;&#91;164&#93;
Musk's long-term vision for the company is the development of technology and resources suitable for human colonization on Mars. He has expressed his interest in someday traveling to the planet, stating "I'd like to die on Mars, just not on impact."&#91;165&#93; A rocket every two years or so could provide a base for the people arriving in 2025 after a launch in 2024.&#91;166&#93;&#91;167&#93; According to Steve Jurvetson, Musk believes that by 2035 at the latest, there will be thousands of rockets flying a million people to Mars, in order to enable a self-sustaining human colony.&#91;168&#93;
In June 2015, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1-mile-long (1.6 ;km) subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.&#91;175&#93;&#91;176&#93; The first competitive event was held at the track in January 2017, the second in August 2017 and the third in December 2018.&#91;177&#93;&#91;178&#93;&#91;179&#93;
SpaceX is headquartered in Hawthorne, California, which also serves as its primary manufacturing plant. The company owns a test site in Texas and operates three launch sites, with another under development. SpaceX also operates regional offices in Redmond, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.&#91;48&#93;
SpaceX Headquarters is located in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California. The large three-story facility, originally built by Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages,&#91;180&#93; houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and, as of 2018, all vehicle manufacturing. In March 2018, SpaceX indicated that it would manufacture its next-generation, 9 ;m (30 ;ft)-diameter launch vehicle, the Starship at a new facility on the Los Angeles waterfront in the San Pedro area. The company had leased an 18-acre (73,000 ;m2) site near Berth 240 in the Los Angeles, however in January 2019 the lease was canceled and the construction of Starship moved to a new site in South Texas.&#91;181&#93;&#91;182&#93;&#91;183&#93;
The area has one of the largest concentrations of aerospace headquarters, facilities, and/or subsidiaries in the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell Douglas main satellite building campuses, Aerospace Corp., Raytheon, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Air Force Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center at Los Angeles Air Force Base, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and AECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates.&#91;180&#93;
SpaceX utilizes a high degree of vertical integration in the production of its rockets and rocket engines.&#91;32&#93; SpaceX builds its rocket engines, rocket stages, spacecraft, principal avionics and all software in-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the aerospace industry. Nevertheless, SpaceX still has over 3,000 suppliers with some 1,100 of those delivering to SpaceX nearly weekly.&#91;184&#93;
In June 2017, SpaceX announced they would construct a facility on 0.88 hectares (2.17 acres) in Port Canaveral Florida for refurbishment and storage of previously flown Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy booster cores.&#91;185&#93;&#91;needs update&#93;
SpaceX operates their first Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas. All SpaceX rocket engines are tested on rocket test stands, and low-altitude VTVL flight testing of the Falcon 9 Grasshopper v1.0 and F9R Dev1 test vehicles in 2013–2014 were carried out at McGregor. 2019 low-altitude VTVL testing of the much larger 9-meter (30 ;ft)-diameter "Starhopper" is planned to occur at the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site near Brownsville, Texas, which is currently under construction.&#91;186&#93;&#91;187&#93;&#91;188&#93; On January 23, 2019, strong winds at the Texas test launch site blew over the nose cone over the first test article rocket, causing delays that will take weeks to repair according to SpaceX representatives.&#91;189&#93; In the event, SpaceX decided to forego building another nose cone for the first test article, because at the low velocities planned for that rocket, it was unnecessary.
The company purchased the McGregor facilities from Beal Aerospace, where it refitted the largest test stand for Falcon 9 engine testing. SpaceX has made a number of improvements to the facility since purchase, and has also extended the acreage by purchasing several pieces of adjacent farmland. In 2011, the company announced plans to upgrade the facility for launch testing a VTVL rocket,&#91;60&#93; and then constructed a half-acre concrete launch facility in 2012 to support the Grasshopper test flight program.&#91;61&#93; As of October ;2012&#91;update&#93;, the McGregor facility had seven test stands that are operated "18 hours a day, six days a week"&#91;190&#93; and is building more test stands because production is ramping up and the company has a large manifest in the next several years. &#91;needs update&#93;
In addition to routine testing, Dragon capsules (following recovery after an orbital mission), are shipped to McGregor for de-fueling, cleanup, and refurbishment for reuse in future missions.
SpaceX currently operates three orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Kennedy Space Center, and is under construction on a fourth in Brownsville, Texas. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.&#91;191&#93; The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral enables orbits of medium inclination, up to 51.6°.&#91;192&#93;&#91;self-published source?&#93; Before it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches took place at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek Island.
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) is used for Falcon 9 launches to low Earth and geostationary orbits. SLC-40 is not capable of supporting Falcon Heavy launches. As part of SpaceX's booster reusability program, the former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zone 1, has been designated for use for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.
Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy,&#91;193&#93; but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W has been converted to Landing Zone 4, where SpaceX successfully landed one Falcon 9 first-stage booster, in October 2018.&#91;194&#93;
On April 14, 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Launch Pad 39A.&#91;195&#93; The pad was subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX has launched 13 Falcon 9 missions from Launch Pad 39A, the latest of which was launched on January 19, 2020.&#91;196&#93; SpaceX launched its first crewed mission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on May 30, 2020.&#91;197&#93;
In August 2014, SpaceX announced they would be building a commercial-only launch facility at Brownsville, Texas.&#91;198&#93;&#91;199&#93; The Federal Aviation Administration released a draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed Texas facility in April 2013, and "found that 'no impacts would occur' that would force the Federal Aviation Administration to deny SpaceX a permit for rocket operations,"&#91;200&#93;&#91;200&#93; and issued the permit in July 2014.&#91;201&#93; SpaceX started construction on the new launch facility in 2014 with production ramping up in the latter half of 2015,&#91;202&#93; with the first suborbital launches from the facility in 2019.&#91;186&#93;&#91;187&#93;&#91;203&#93; Real estate packages at the location have been named by SpaceX with names based on the theme "Mars Crossing".&#91;204&#93;&#91;205&#93;
In January 2015, SpaceX announced it would be entering the satellite production business and global satellite internet business. The first satellite facility is a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 ;m2) office building located in Redmond, Washington. As of January 2017, a second facility in Redmond was acquired with 40,625 square feet (3,774.2 ;m2) and has become a research and development lab for the satellites.&#91;206&#93; In July 2016, SpaceX acquired an additional 8,000 square feet (740 ;m2) creative space in Irvine, California (Orange County) to focus on satellite communications.&#91;207&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93;
SpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified for US military launches of Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately 30 missions on manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represents over $12 ;billion under contract.&#91;48&#93;
SpaceX along with Virgin Galactic were among the first to have a contract with Spaceport America in New Mexico, the first and only full-scale public commercial spaceport in the United States. Among the tests conducted at the spaceport was the Grasshopper, they continue to have a smaller contract with the spaceport for potential future use, alongside their own private SpaceX South Texas Launch Site to the southwest.&#91;208&#93;
In 2006, NASA announced that SpaceX had won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport.&#91;209&#93;&#91;210&#93; This contract, designed by NASA to provide "seed money" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX $396 ;million to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX self-invested more than $500 ;million to develop the Falcon 9 launch vehicle.&#91;211&#93; These Space Act Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development ~4–10 times cheaper than if produced by NASA alone.&#91;106&#93;
In December 2010, the launch of the COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft.&#91;212&#93; Dragon was successfully deployed into orbit, circled the Earth twice, and then made a controlled re-entry burn for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. With Dragon's safe recovery, SpaceX became the first private company to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; prior to this mission, only government agencies had been able to recover orbital spacecraft.
COTS Demo Flight 2 launched in May 2012, in which Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS, marking the first time that a private spacecraft had accomplished this feat.&#91;213&#93;&#91;214&#93;
Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6 ;billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.&#91;215&#93;&#91;self-published source?&#93; SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.&#91;216&#93; CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX.&#91;217&#93;&#91;218&#93; After further extensions late in 2015, SpaceX is currently scheduled to fly a total of 20 missions.&#91;219&#93; A second phase of contracts (known as CRS-2) were solicited and proposed in 2014. They were awarded in January 2016, for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024. SpaceX will be using heavy Dragon XL rockets to send supplies to NASA's Lunar Gateway space station.&#91;220&#93;
The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program intends to develop commercially operated spacecraft that are capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX did not win a Space Act Agreement in the first round (CCDev 1), but during the second round (CCDev 2), NASA awarded SpaceX with a contract worth $75 ;million to further develop their launch escape system, test a crew accommodations mock-up, and to further progress their Falcon/Dragon crew transportation design.&#91;221&#93;&#91;222&#93;&#91;223&#93; The CCDev program later became Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap), and in August 2012, NASA announced that SpaceX had been awarded $440 ;million to continue development and testing of its Dragon 2 spacecraft.&#91;224&#93;&#91;225&#93;
In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that will be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS. SpaceX won $2.6 ;billion to complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts include at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon achieves NASA certification, the contract requires SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.&#91;226&#93; In early 2017, SpaceX was awarded four additional crewed missions to the ISS from NASA to shuttle astronauts back and forth.&#91;227&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93; In early 2019, SpaceX successfully conducted a test flight of Crew Dragon, which it docked (instead of Dragon 1's method of berthing using Canada arm 2) and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.

May 27, 2020 - The planned launch of American astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station was aborted 16 minutes before the scheduled launch time due to poor weather conditions. The Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule launch was postponed to May 30, 2020 where it launched successfully at 3:22 ;p.m. ET (7:22 ;p.m. UTC).&#91;234&#93;
In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100 ;million worth of launches from the company.&#91;235&#93;&#91;self-published source?&#93; In April 2008, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to $1 ;billion, depending on the number of missions awarded. The contract covers launch services ordered by June 2010, for launches through December 2012.&#91;236&#93; Musk stated in the same 2008 announcement that SpaceX has sold 14 contracts for flights on the various Falcon vehicles.&#91;236&#93; In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense. The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on June 25, 2019.&#91;237&#93;
In May 2015, the United States Air Force announced that the Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for national security space launch, which allows SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.&#91;238&#93; This broke the monopoly held since 2006 by ULA over the US Air Force launches of classified payloads.&#91;239&#93;
In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch, an $82.7 ;million contract to SpaceX to launch the 2nd GPS III satellite in May 2018; this estimated cost was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.&#91;240&#93;&#91;241&#93;&#91;242&#93; Prior to this, United Launch Alliance was the only provider certified to launch national security payloads.&#91;243&#93;&#91;243&#93;&#91;244&#93; ULA did not submit a bid for the May 2018 launch.&#91;245&#93;&#91;246&#93;
In 2016 the US National Reconnaissance Office said it had purchased launches from SpaceX - the first (for NROL-76) took place on May 1, 2017.&#91;247&#93;
In March 2017 SpaceX won (vs ULA) with a bid of $96.5 ;million for the 3rd GPS III launch (due Feb 2019).&#91;248&#93;
In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional $290 ;million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch three next-generation GPS satellites, known as GPS III. The first of these launches is expected to take place in March 2020.&#91;249&#93;
In February 2019, SpaceX secured a $297 ;million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch three national security missions, including AFSPC-44, NROL-87, and NROL-85, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.&#91;250&#93;
In February 2020, Space Adventures announced plans to fly private citizens into orbit on Crew Dragon.&#91;251&#93; The Crew Dragon vehicle would launch from LC-39A with up to four tourists on board, and spend up to five days in a low-Earth orbit with an apogee of over 1000 ;km.&#91;252&#93;
SpaceX won a contract to launch two of Kazakhstan's satellites aboard the Falcon 9 launch rocket on a rideshare with other satellites. The launch took place at Vandenberg Air Force Base on December 3, 2018, with Kazakhstan's two satellites, KazSaySat and KazistiSat, included in a payload totaling 64 miniature and small satellites.&#91;253&#93;&#91;254&#93;&#91;255&#93; According to the Kazakh Defence and Aerospace Ministry, the launch from SpaceX cost the country $1.3 ;million.&#91;256&#93;
SpaceX's low launch prices, especially for communication satellites flying to geostationary (GTO) orbit, have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.&#91;32&#93; Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying Ariane 5) and International Launch Services (flying Proton).&#91;257&#93; With a published price of US$56.5 million per launch to low Earth orbit, "Falcon 9 rockets [were] already the cheapest in the industry. Reusable Falcon 9s could drop the price by an order of magnitude, sparking more space-based enterprise, which in turn would drop the cost of access to space still further through economies of scale."&#91;258&#93; SpaceX has publicly indicated that if they are successful with developing the reusable technology, launch prices in the US$5 to 7 million range for the reusable Falcon 9 are possible.&#91;259&#93;
In 2014, SpaceX had won nine contracts out of 20 that were openly competed worldwide in 2014 at commercial launch service providers.&#91;260&#93; Space media reported that SpaceX had "already begun to take market share" from Arianespace.&#91;261&#93; Arianespace has requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.&#91;262&#93;&#91;263&#93; European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce Ariane 5 and the future Ariane 6 rocket launch prices as a result of competition from SpaceX. According to one Arianespace managing director in 2015, it was clear that "a very significant challenge [was] coming from SpaceX ... Therefore things have to change ... and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined."&#91;264&#93; Jean Botti, Director of innovation for Airbus (which makes the Ariane 5) warned that "those who don't take Elon Musk seriously will have a lot to worry about."&#91;265&#93; In 2014, no commercial launches were booked to fly on the Russian Proton rocket.&#91;260&#93;
Also in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing began to affect the market for launch of US military payloads. For nearly a decade the large US launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA) had faced no competition for military launches.&#91;266&#93; Without this competition, launch costs by the U.S. provider rose to over $400 ;million.&#91;267&#93; The ULA monopoly ended when SpaceX began to compete for national security launches. At a side-by-side comparison, SpaceX's launch costs for commercial missions are considerably lower at $62 ;million.&#91;268&#93;&#91;self-published source?&#93;
In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.&#91;269&#93; To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce in order to decrease launch costs by half.&#91;270&#93;&#91;271&#93;
In 2017, SpaceX had 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts, the estimate for 2018 is about 65% as of July 2018.&#91;272&#93;
On January 11, 2019, SpaceX issued a statement announcing it would lay off 10% of its workforce, in order to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects.&#91;273&#93;
In the first quarter of 2020, SpaceX launched over 61,000 ;kg (134,000 ;lb) of payload mass to orbit while all Chinese, European, and Russian launchers placed approximately 21,000 ;kg (46,000 ;lb), 16,000 ;kg (35,000 ;lb) and 13,000 ;kg (29,000 ;lb) in orbit, respectively, with all other launch providers launching approximately 15,000 ;kg (33,000 ;lb).&#91;274&#93;
NASA announced its first crewed launch in over a decade using SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule would take place May 27, 2020 from Kennedy Space Center, at SpaceX's Launch Complex 39A (LC-39), taking astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station.&#91;275&#93; The launch was postponed due to bad weather.&#91;276&#93; The vehicle launched successfully on May 30, 2020.&#91;277&#93;

Dragon 2 is a class of reusable spacecraft developed and manufactured by American aerospace manufacturer SpaceX as the successor to the Dragon 1 cargo spacecraft. It has two variants; Crew Dragon, a human-rated capsule capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts, and Cargo Dragon, an updated replacement for the original Dragon spacecraft. The spacecraft launches atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket and returns to Earth via an ocean splashdown. Unlike its predecessor, the spacecraft can dock itself to the ISS instead of being berthed.  Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated launch escape system (LES) capable of accelerating the vehicle away from the rocket in an emergency at 11.8 ;m/s2, accomplished by using a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two SuperDraco engines each. The spacecraft features redesigned solar arrays and a modified outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possess new flight computers and avionics. As of March 2020, four Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured (not counting structural test articles that were never airborne); a test article named Dragonfly and three flightworthy vehicles, one of which was destroyed in an engine test.
Crew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that is expected to shuttle crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS) under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the other being the Boeing CST-100 Starliner. It is also expected to be used in flights by American space tourism company Space Adventures and to shuttle tourists to and from Axiom Space's planned space station. Crew Dragon's first non-piloted test flight occurred in March 2019, and its first crewed flight – with astronauts Robert L. Behnken and Douglas G. Hurley – occurred 30 May 2020 at 3:22PM ET. This test flight marked the first time a private company has launched a crewed orbital spacecraft. Cargo Dragon is expected to supply cargo to the ISS under a Commercial Resupply Services-2 contract with NASA, along with Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems' Cygnus spacecraft and Sierra Nevada Corporation's Dream Chaser spacecraft. The first flight of the Dragon 2 variant of Cargo Dragon is planned to launch in October 2020.
There are two variants: Crew Dragon and Cargo Dragon.&#91;5&#93; Crew Dragon was initially called DragonRider&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93; and it was intended from the beginning to support a crew of seven or a combination of crew and cargo.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; It is able to perform fully autonomous rendezvous and docking with manual override ability using the NASA Docking System (NDS).&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; For typical missions, Crew Dragon will remain docked to the ISS for a period of 180 days, but is designed to remain on the station for up to 210 days, matching the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93; From the beginning of the development process, SpaceX planned to use an integrated pusher launch escape system for the Dragon spacecraft.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;
SpaceX originally intended to land Crew Dragon on land using the LES engines, with parachutes and an ocean splashdown available in the case of an aborted launch. Precision water landing under parachutes was proposed to NASA as "the baseline return and recovery approach for the first few flights" of Crew Dragon.&#91;23&#93; Propulsive landing was later cancelled, leaving ocean splashdown under parachutes as the only option.&#91;24&#93; As of 2011&#91;update&#93;, the Paragon Space Development Corporation was assisting in developing Crew Dragon's life support system.&#91;25&#93;
In 2012, SpaceX was in talks with Orbital Outfitters about developing space suits to wear during launch and re-entry.&#91;26&#93; Each crew member wears a custom space suit fitted for them. The suit is primarily designed for use inside the Dragon (IVA type suit), however in the case of a rapid cabin depressurization the suit can protect the crew members. The suit can also provide cooling for astronauts during normal flight.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; For the SpX-DM1 test, a test dummy nicknamed Ripley was fitted with the spacesuit and sensors. The spacesuit "is made from Nomex" a fire retardant fabric similar to Kevlar.
At a NASA news conference on 18 May 2012, SpaceX confirmed their target launch price for crewed Dragon flights of US$160 ;million, or about $23 ;million per seat if the maximum crew of seven is aboard and NASA orders at least four Crew Dragon flights per year.&#91;29&#93; This contrasts with the 2014 Soyuz launch price of $76 ;million per seat for NASA astronauts.&#91;30&#93; The spacecraft's design was unveiled on 29 May 2014, during a press event at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93; In October 2014, NASA selected the Dragon spacecraft as one of the candidates to fly American astronauts to the International Space Station under the Commercial Crew Program.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; SpaceX plans to use the Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle for launching Dragon 2.&#91;4&#93;
Although Dragon 2 was intended from earliest design concept to carry crew, or with fewer seats, both crew and cargo, a second round of multi-year cargo supply contracts (also known as CRS-2) was solicited by NASA in 2014 to supply the ISS in 2020–2024. This led to SpaceX proposing a separately-named model, Cargo Dragon, for the NASA flights.&#91;37&#93; SpaceX won a contract award for Cargo Dragon as a result of the CRS-2 bid competition, with contracts awarded in January 2016 for six flights.&#91;38&#93;
Dragon 2 includes the following features:&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93;&#91;39&#93;
Dragon 2 is partially reusable, potentially resulting in a significant cost reduction. SpaceX planned to use new capsules for every crewed flight for NASA but is looking at reusing the capsules.&#91;40&#93; Cargo Dragon can carry 3,307 kilograms (7,291 ;lb) to the ISS; Crew Dragon has a capacity of seven astronauts (only four seats are used for NASA missions). Above the seats, there is a three-screen control panel, a toilet (with privacy curtain), and the docking hatch. Ocean landings are accomplished with four main parachutes in both variants. The parachute system was fully redesigned from the one used in the prior Dragon capsule, due to the need to deploy the parachutes under a variety of launch abort scenarios.&#91;41&#93;
Crew Dragon has eight side-mounted SuperDraco engines, clustered in redundant pairs in four engine pods, with each engine able to produce 71 kilonewtons (16,000 ;lbf) of thrust to be used for launch aborts.&#91;31&#93; Each pod also contains four Draco thrusters that can be used for attitude control and orbital maneuvers. The SuperDraco engine combustion chamber is printed of Inconel, an alloy of nickel and iron, using a process of direct metal laser sintering. Engines are contained in a protective nacelle to prevent fault propagation if an engine fails.
Once on orbit, Dragon 2 is able to autonomously dock to the ISS. Dragon used berthing, a non-autonomous means to attach to the ISS that was completed by use of the Canadarm2 robotic arm. Pilots of Crew Dragon retain the ability to dock the spacecraft using manual controls interfaced with a static tablet-like computer. The spacecraft can be operated in full vacuum, and "the crew will wear SpaceX-designed space suits to protect them from a rapid cabin depressurization emergency event". Also, the spacecraft will be able to return safely if a leak occurs "of up to an equivalent orifice of 6.35 mm [0.25 in] in diameter".&#91;23&#93;
Propellant and helium pressurant for both launch aborts and on-orbit maneuvering is contained in composite-carbon-overwrap titanium spherical tanks. A PICA-X heat shield protects the capsule during reentry, while a movable ballast sled allows more precise attitude control of the spacecraft during the atmospheric entry phase of the return to Earth and more accurate control of the landing ellipse location.&#91;23&#93; A reusable nose cone "protects the vessel and the docking adaptor during ascent and reentry",&#91;23&#93; pivoting on a hinge to enable in-space docking and returning to the covered position for reentry and future launches.&#91;33&#93;
The trunk is the third structural element of the spacecraft, containing solar panels, heat-removal radiators, and fins to provide aerodynamic stability during emergency aborts.&#91;23&#93;
The previous Cargo Dragon's deployable solar arrays have been eliminated and are now built into the trunk itself. This increases volume space, reduces the number of mechanisms on the vehicle and further increases reliability.
Dragon is intended to fulfill a set of requirements that will make the capsule useful to both commercial and government customers. SpaceX and Bigelow Aerospace are working together to support round-trip transport of commercial passengers to low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations, using the full capacity of seven passengers. NASA flights to the ISS will only have four astronauts, with the added payload mass and volume used to carry pressurized cargo.&#91;41&#93;
On 16 September 2014, NASA announced that SpaceX and Boeing had been selected to provide crew transportation to the ISS. SpaceX will receive $2.6 ;billion under this contract.&#91;42&#93; Dragon was the least expensive proposal,&#91;35&#93; but NASA's William H. Gerstenmaier considered the CST-100 proposal the stronger of the two.
In a departure from the prior NASA practice, where construction contracts with commercial firms led to direct NASA operation of the spacecraft, NASA is purchasing space transport services from SpaceX, including construction, launch, and operation of the Dragon 2.&#91;43&#93;
In August 2018, NASA and SpaceX agreed on the loading procedures for propellants, vehicle fluids and crew. High-pressure helium will be loaded first, followed by the passengers approximately two hours prior to scheduled launch; the ground crew will then depart the launch pad and move to a safe distance. The launch escape system will be activated approximately 40 minutes prior to launch, with propellant loading commencing several minutes later.&#91;44&#93; The first automated test mission launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on 2 March 2019.&#91;45&#93;
In early 2019, crewed flights were expected to begin no earlier than July 2019.&#91;46&#93; They were later planned to begin no earlier than on 30 May 2020. The first crewed flight launched on 30 May 2020&#91;47&#93; with the launch of the Demo-2 mission.
In June 2019, Bigelow Space Operations announced it had reserved with SpaceX up to four missions of four passengers each to ISS as early as 2020 and planned to sell them for around US$52 ;million per seat.&#91;48&#93; These plans were canceled by September 2019.
On 18 February 2020, building on development for NASA's commercial crew program, Space Adventures announced an agreement with SpaceX to fly up to four paying space tourists on a standalone mission aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft in late 2021 or 2022 that could reach an altitude two-to-three times higher than the International Space Station.&#91;49&#93;
In early 2019, crewed flights were expected to begin no earlier than July 2019.&#91;46&#93;  The first crewed flight launched on 30 May 2020&#91;47&#93; with the launch of the Demo-2 mission.
SpaceX planned a series of four flight tests for the Crew Dragon - a "pad abort" test, an uncrewed orbital flight to the ISS, an in-flight abort test, and finally a 14-day crewed demonstration mission to the ISS,&#91;50&#93; which was initially planned for July 2019,&#91;46&#93; but after a Dragon capsule explosion, was delayed to May 2020.&#91;51&#93;
The pad abort test was conducted successfully on 6 May 2015 at SpaceX's leased SLC-40.&#91;41&#93; Dragon landed safely in the ocean to the east of the launchpad 99 seconds after ignition of the SuperDraco engines.&#91;52&#93; While a flight-like Dragon 2 and trunk were used for the pad abort test, they rested atop a truss structure for the test rather than a full Falcon 9 rocket. A crash test dummy embedded with a suite of sensors was placed inside the test vehicle to record acceleration loads and forces at the crew seat, while the remaining six seats were loaded with weights to simulate full-passenger-load weight.&#91;43&#93;&#91;53&#93; The test objective was to demonstrate sufficient total impulse, thrust and controllability to conduct a safe pad abort. A fuel mixture ratio issue was detected after the flight in one of the eight SuperDraco engines, but did not materially affect the flight.&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93;
On 24 November 2015, SpaceX conducted a test of Dragon 2's hovering abilities at the firm's rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas. In a video, the spacecraft is shown suspended by a hoisting cable and igniting its SuperDraco engines to hover for about 5 seconds, balancing on its 8 engines firing at reduced thrust to compensate exactly for gravity.&#91;56&#93; The test vehicle was the same capsule that performed the pad abort test earlier in 2015; it was nicknamed DragonFly.&#91;57&#93;
In 2015, NASA named its first Commercial Crew astronaut cadre of four veteran astronauts to work with SpaceX and Boeing – Robert Behnken, Eric Boe, Sunita Williams, and Douglas Hurley.&#91;58&#93; The Crew Dragon Demo-1 mission will complete the last milestone of the Commercial Crew Development program, paving the way to starting commercial services under an upcoming ISS Crew Transportation Services contract.&#91;43&#93;&#91;59&#93; On 3 August 2018, NASA announced the crew for the DM-2 mission.&#91;60&#93; The crew of two will be formed by NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. Behnken previously flew as mission specialist on the STS-123 and the STS-130 missions. Hurley previously flew as a pilot on the STS-127 mission and on the final Space Shuttle mission, the STS-135 mission.
The first orbital test of Crew Dragon was an uncrewed mission, designated Crew Dragon Demo-1 &#91;43&#93; and launched on 2 March 2019.&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93; The spacecraft tested the approach and automated docking procedures with the ISS,&#91;63&#93; remained docked until 8 March 2019, then conducted the full re-entry, splashdown and recovery steps to qualify for a crewed mission.&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93; Life-support systems were monitored all along the test flight. The same capsule was planned to be re-used in June for an in-flight abort test before it exploded on 20 April 2019.&#91;61&#93;&#91;66&#93;
On 20 April 2019, the Crew Dragon capsule used in the Crew Dragon Demo-1 mission was destroyed in an explosion during static fire testing at the Landing Zone 1 facility.&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93; On the day of the explosion, the initial testing of the Crew Dragon's Draco thrusters was successful, with the accident occurring during the test of the SuperDraco abort system.&#91;69&#93;
Telemetry, high-speed camera footage, and analysis of recovered debris indicate the problem occurred when a small amount of dinitrogen tetroxide leaked into a helium line used to pressurize the propellant tanks. The leakage apparently occurred during pre-test processing. As a result, the pressurization of the system 100 ms before firing damaged a check valve and resulted in the explosion.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;
Since the destroyed capsule had been slated for use in the upcoming in-flight abort test, the explosion and investigation delayed that test and the subsequent crewed orbital test.&#91;71&#93;
The SuperDraco engine test that failed on 20 April 2019 was repeated successfully on 13 November 2019. The full duration static fire test of Crew Dragon's launch escape system took place at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at SpaceX's Landing zone 1 at 20:08 UTC. The test was successful, showing that the modifications made to the vehicle to prevent a failure like the one that happened 20 April were successful. The vehicle used for this ground test would also be used for the following in-flight abort test.&#91;72&#93;
Some of the modifications are:
The Crew Dragon in-flight abort test was launched on 19 January 2020 at 15:30 UTC from Launch Complex 39A on a suborbital trajectory to conduct a separation and abort scenario in the troposphere at transonic velocities shortly after passing through max Q, where the vehicle experiences maximum aerodynamic pressure. The Dragon 2 used its SuperDraco abort engines to push itself away from the Falcon 9 after an intentional premature engine cutoff. The spacecraft followed its suborbital trajectory to apogee, at which point the spacecraft's trunk was jettisoned. The smaller Draco engines were then used to orient the vehicle for the descent. All major functions were executed, including separation, engine firings, parachute deployment, and landing. Dragon 2 splashed down at 15:38:54 UTC just off the Florida coast in the Atlantic Ocean.&#91;74&#93; The test objective was to demonstrate the ability to safely move away from the ascending rocket under the most challenging atmospheric conditions of the flight trajectory, imposing the worst structural stress of a real flight on the rocket and spacecraft.&#91;41&#93; The abort test was performed using a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket with a fully fueled second stage with a mass simulator replacing the Merlin engine.&#91;75&#93;
Earlier, this test had been scheduled before the uncrewed orbital test,&#91;76&#93; however, SpaceX and NASA considered it safer to use a flight representative capsule rather than the test article from the pad abort test.&#91;77&#93;
This test was previously planned to use the capsule C201 from SpaceX Demo-1, however, C201 was destroyed in an explosion during a static fire testing on 20 April 2019.&#91;78&#93; Capsule C205, originally planned for Demo-2 was used for the In-Flight Abort Test&#91;79&#93; with C206 being planned for use during Demo-2.
This was the final flight test of the spacecraft before it began carrying astronauts to the International Space Station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
Prior to the flight test, teams completed launch day procedures for the first crewed flight test, from suit-up to launch pad operations. The joint teams conducted full data reviews that needed to be completed prior to NASA astronauts flying on the system during SpaceX's Demo-2 mission.&#91;80&#93;
Launching in the Dragon 2 spacecraft was described by astronaut Bob Behnken as "smooth off the pad" but "we were definitely driving and riding a dragon all the way up...  a little bit less g's [than the Space Shuttle] but more 'alive' is probably the best way I would describe it."  &#91;86&#93;
Crew Dragon units and mission assignments after the 20 April 2019 explosion that destroyed C201.&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93;
As of May 2020 there are nine Crew Dragon flights contracted to carry crew, seven are contracted by NASA (one crewed test flight and six operational crew rotation missions),&#91;91&#93; and two (one each) contracted by private companies Axiom Space&#91;92&#93; and Space Adventures.&#91;93&#93;

Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX in the United States. It is powered by Merlin engines, also developed by SpaceX, burning cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants. Its name is derived from the fictional Star Wars spaceship, the Millennium Falcon, and the nine Merlin engines of the rocket's first stage.&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; The rocket evolved with versions v1.0 (2010–2013), v1.1 (2013–2016), v1.2 "Full Thrust" (2015–present), including the Block 5 Full Thrust variant, flying since May 2018. Unlike most rockets, which are expendable launch systems, since the introduction of the Full Thrust version, Falcon 9 is partially reusable, with the first stage capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after separating from the second stage. This feat was achieved for the first time on flight 20 with the v1.2 version in December 2015.
Falcon 9 can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms (50,300 ;lb) to low Earth orbit, 8,300 ;kg (18,300 ;lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) when expended, and 5,500 ;kg (12,100 ;lb) to GTO when the first stage is recovered.&#91;1&#93;&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; The heaviest GTO payloads flown have been Intelsat 35e with 6,761 ;kg (14,905 ;lb), and Telstar 19V with 7,075 ;kg (15,598 ;lb). However, the latter was launched into a lower-energy GTO orbit achieving an apogee well below the geostationary altitude.&#91;19&#93;
In 2008, SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract in NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program to deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The first mission under this contract launched on October 8, 2012.&#91;20&#93; Falcon 9 has been human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the ISS as part of the NASA Commercial Crew Development program. Currently, Falcon 9 has been certified for the National Security Space Launch&#91;21&#93; program and NASA Launch Services Program as "Category 3", which can launch the priciest, most important, and most complex NASA missions.&#91;22&#93;
Five rockets of the version 1.0 design were launched from June 2010 to March 2013. Version 1.1 conducted fifteen launches from September 2013 to January 2016. The "Full Thrust" version was in service from December 2015 into 2018, with several additional upgrades within this version. The latest variant, Block 5, was introduced in May 2018.&#91;23&#93; It features increased engine thrust, improved landing legs, and other minor improvements to help recovery and reuse. The Falcon Heavy derivative, introduced in February 2018, consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as its center core, attached to two standard Falcon 9 first stages used as boosters.
As early as October 2005, SpaceX had publicly announced plans to launch Falcon 9 in the first half of 2007.&#91;24&#93; In the event, the first launch would occur in 2010.
While SpaceX exclusively spent its own money to develop its previous launcher, the Falcon 1, development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA funding parts&#91;which?&#93; of development costs and committing to purchase several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; The contract was structured as a Space Act Agreement (SAA) "to develop and demonstrate commercial orbital transportation service"&#91;26&#93;, including the purchase of three demonstration flights.&#91;27&#93; The overall contract award was US$278 million to provide development funding for Dragon, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon. In 2011 additional milestones were added, bringing the total contract value to US$396 million.&#91;28&#93;
NASA became an anchor tenant for the vehicle in 2008,&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93; when they contracted to purchase 12 Commercial Resupply Services launches to the International Space Station, whereby funds would be disbursed only after the initial COTS demonstration missions were completed and deemed successful. The space logistics delivery contract was worth US$1.6 billion for a minimum of 12 missions to carry supplies to and from the station.&#91;31&#93;
Musk has repeatedly said that, without the NASA money, the development would have taken longer.
In 2011, SpaceX estimated that Falcon 9 v1.0 development costs were on the order of $300 ;million.&#91;32&#93; NASA evaluated that development costs would have been $3.6 ;billion if a traditional cost-plus contract approach had been used.&#91;33&#93; In 2014, SpaceX released total combined development costs for both the Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. NASA provided US$396 million, while SpaceX provided over US$450 million to fund rocket and capsule development efforts.&#91;34&#93;
A 2011 NASA report "estimated that it would have cost the agency about US$4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes" while "a more 'commercial development' approach might have allowed the agency to pay only US$1.7 billion."&#91;35&#93;
Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the unusual NASA process of "setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at substantially lower cost. "According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's development costs of both the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets were estimated at approximately US$390 million in total."&#91;35&#93;
SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.&#91;36&#93; In 2005, SpaceX announced it was instead proceeding with the development of the Falcon 9, a "fully reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle", and had already secured a government customer. The Falcon ;9 was described as being capable of launching approximately 9,500 ;kg (21,000 ;lb) to low Earth orbit, and was projected to be priced at $27 ;million per flight with a 3.7 ;m (12 ;ft) payload fairing and $35 ;million with a 5.2 ;m (17 ;ft) fairing. SpaceX also announced the development of a heavy version of the Falcon 9 with a payload capacity of approximately 25,000 ;kg (55,000 ;lb).&#91;37&#93; The Falcon 9 was intended to enable launches to LEO, GTO, as well as both crew and cargo vehicles to the ISS.&#91;36&#93;
The original NASA COTS contract called for the first demonstration flight of Falcon in September 2008, and the completion of all three demonstration missions by September 2009.&#91;38&#93; In February 2008, the plan for the first Falcon 9/Dragon COTS Demo flight was delayed by six months into the first quarter of 2009. According to Elon Musk, the complexity of the development work and the regulatory requirements for launching from Cape Canaveral contributed to the delay.&#91;39&#93;
The first multi-engine test (with two engines connected to the first stage, firing simultaneously) was completed in January 2008,&#91;40&#93; with successive tests leading to the full Falcon ;9 complement of nine engines test-fired for a full mission length (178 ;seconds) of the first stage in November 2008.&#91;41&#93; In October 2009, the first flight-ready first stage had a successful all-engine test fire at the company's test stand in McGregor, Texas. In November 2009 SpaceX conducted the initial second stage test firing lasting forty seconds. This test succeeded without aborts or recycles. In January 2010, a full-duration (329 seconds) orbit-insertion firing of the Falcon ;9 second stage was conducted at the McGregor test site.&#91;42&#93; The full stack arrived at the launch site for integration at the beginning of February 2010, and SpaceX initially scheduled launch date of March 2010. However, they estimated anywhere between one and three months for integration and testing.&#91;43&#93;
In February 2010, SpaceX's first flight stack was set vertical at Space Launch Complex ;40, Cape Canaveral,&#91;44&#93; and on March 9, SpaceX performed a static fire test, where the first stage was to be fired without taking off. The test aborted at T−2 ;seconds due to a failure in the system designed to pump high-pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage turbopumps, which would get them spinning in preparation for launch. A subsequent review showed that the failure occurred when a valve did not receive a command to open. As the problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself, it didn't happen at the McGregor test site, which did not have the same valve setup. Some fire and smoke were seen at the base of the rocket, leading to speculation of an engine fire. However, the fire and smoke were the results of normal burnoff from the liquid oxygen and fuel mix present in the system prior to launch, and no damage was sustained by the vehicle or the test pad. All vehicle systems leading up to the abort performed as expected, and no additional issues were noted that needed addressing. A subsequent test on March 13 was successful in firing the nine first-stage engines for 3.5 ;seconds.&#91;45&#93;
In December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months, with a plan to double the rate to one every six weeks.&#91;46&#93; By September 2013, SpaceX's total manufacturing space had increased to nearly 1,000,000 ;sq ;ft (93,000 ;m2), and the factory had been configured to achieve a maximum production rate of 40 rocket cores per year.&#91;47&#93;  The factory was producing one Falcon 9 vehicle per month as of November 2013. The company planned to increase to 18 vehicles per year in mid-2014, 24 per year by the end of 2014,&#91;48&#93;&#91;49&#93; and 40 rocket cores per year by the end of 2015.&#91;50&#93;
These production rates were not achieved by February 2016 as previously planned; the company indicated that production rate for Falcon 9 cores had only recently increased to 18 per year, and the number of first stage cores that can be assembled at one time had doubled from three to six.  The production rate was expected to grow to 30 cores per year by the end of 2016,&#91;51&#93;. Still, as of August ;2016&#91;update&#93;, SpaceX was working towards a production capacity of 40 cores per year,&#91;52&#93; the full factory capacity envisioned in 2013.&#91;47&#93;&#91;53&#93;
Rockets from the Falcon 9 family have been launched 88 times over 10 ;years, resulting in 86 full mission successes (97.7%), one partial success (CRS-1 delivered its cargo to the ISS, but a secondary payload was stranded in a lower-than-planned orbit), and one failure (the CRS-7 spacecraft was lost in flight). Additionally, one rocket and its payload Amos-6 were destroyed before launch in preparation for an on-pad static fire test.
The first rocket version Falcon 9 v1.0 was launched five times from June 2010 to March 2013, its successor Falcon 9 v1.1 15 times from September 2013 to January 2016, and the latest upgrade Falcon 9 Full Thrust 65 times from December 2015 to present, 26 of which using a re-flown first stage booster. Falcon Heavy was launched once in February 2018, incorporating two refurbished first stages as side boosters, and then again in April and June 2019, the June flight reusing the side booster from the previous flight. The final "Block 4" booster to be produced was flown in April 2018, and the first Block 5 version in May. While Block 4 boosters were only flown twice and required several months of refurbishment, Block 5 versions are designed to sustain 10 flights with just inspections, possibly on a 24-hour turnover.&#91;54&#93;
The rocket's first-stage boosters have been recovered in 52 of 62 landing attempts (84%), with 28 out of 32 for the latest version, Block 5.

The Falcon 9 is a two-stage, LOX/RP-1-powered heavy-lift launch vehicle. Both stages are equipped with Merlin 1D rocket engines, nine sea-level adapted versions on the first stage, and one vacuum adapted version on the second stage. Every engine uses a pyrophoric mixture of triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB) as an engine igniter.&#91;58&#93; The first stage engines are arranged in a structural form SpaceX calls "Octaweb".&#91;59&#93; Many cores include four extensible landing legs attached around the base of the Octaweb.&#91;60&#93; To control the descent of the boosters and center core through the atmosphere, SpaceX often uses grid fins that deploy from the vehicle after separation.&#91;61&#93; The legs will then deploy as the boosters return to Earth, landing each softly on the ground.&#91;62&#93;
The propellant tank walls and domes are made from aluminum-lithium alloy. SpaceX uses an all friction-stir welded tank, the highest strength and most reliable welding technique available.&#91;5&#93; The second stage tank of a Falcon ;9 is simply a shorter version of the first stage tank. It uses most of the same tooling, material, and manufacturing techniques, reducing production costs.&#91;5&#93; The Falcon 9 interstage, which connects the upper and lower stage, is a carbon-fiber aluminum-core composite structure. Reusable separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system separates the stages. The original design stage separation system had twelve attachment points, which was reduced to just three in the v1.1 launcher.&#91;63&#93;
The Falcon 9 uses a payload fairing to protect (non-Dragon) satellites during launch. The fairing is 13 ;m (43 ;ft) long, 5.2 ;m (17 ;ft) in diameter, weighs approximately 1,900 ;kg, and is constructed of carbon fiber skin overlaid on an aluminum honeycomb core.&#91;64&#93; SpaceX designed and fabricates fairings at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Testing of the design was completed at NASA's Plum Brook Station facility in spring 2013 where the acoustic shock and mechanical vibration of launch, plus electromagnetic static discharge conditions, were simulated on a full-size test article in a huge vacuum chamber.&#91;65&#93;
SpaceX uses multiple redundant flight computers in a fault-tolerant design. Each Merlin rocket engine is controlled by three voting computers, each of which has two physical processors that constantly check each other. The software runs on Linux and is written in C++.&#91;66&#93; For flexibility, commercial off-the-shelf parts and system-wide radiation-tolerant design are used instead of rad-hardened parts.&#91;66&#93; Each stage has stage-level flight computers, in addition to the Merlin-specific engine controllers, of the same fault-tolerant triad design to handle stage control functions. Each engine microcontroller CPU runs on a PowerPC architecture.&#91;67&#93;
The Falcon 9 rocket can lose up to two of the engines and still complete the mission. The Merlin 1D engines can vector thrust for greater control to the rocket. Each Merlin engine produces 854 ;kN (192,000 ;lbf) of thrust.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The original Falcon 9 v1.0 flew five successful orbital launches in 2010–2013. The much larger Falcon 9 v1.1 made its first flight in September 2013. The demonstration mission carried a very small 500 ;kg (1,100 ;lb) primary payload, the CASSIOPE satellite;&#91;63&#93; larger payloads followed for v1.1, starting with the launch of the large SES-8 GEO communications satellite.&#91;68&#93; Both Falcon 9 v1.0 and Falcon 9 v1.1 were expendable launch vehicles (ELVs). The Falcon 9 Full Thrust made its first flight in December 2015. The first stage of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust version is reusable. The current version, known as Falcon 9 Block 5, made its first flight in May 2018.
The first version of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, Falcon 9 v1.0, was an expendable launch vehicle that was developed in 2005–2010, and was launched for the first time in 2010. Falcon 9 v1.0 made five flights in 2010–2013, after which it was retired.
The Falcon 9 v1.0 first stage was powered by nine Merlin 1C rocket engines arranged in a 3×3 pattern. Each of these engines had a sea-level thrust of 556 ;kN (125,000 pounds-force) for a total thrust on liftoff of about 5,000 ;kN (1,100,000 pounds-force).&#91;5&#93; The Falcon 9 v1.0 second stage was powered by a single Merlin 1C engine modified for vacuum operation, with an expansion ratio of 117:1 and a nominal burn time of 345 ;seconds. Gaseous N2 thrusters were used on the Falcon 9 v1.0 second-stage as a reaction control system.&#91;69&#93;
SpaceX expressed hopes initially that both stages would eventually be reusable.&#91;70&#93; But early results from adding lightweight thermal protection system capability to the booster stage and using parachute recovery were not successful,&#91;71&#93; leading to abandonment of that approach and the initiation of a new design. In 2011, SpaceX began a formal and funded development program for a reusable Falcon 9, with the early program focus however on return of the first stage.&#91;62&#93;
The Falcon 9 v1.1 is a 60 percent heavier rocket with 60 percent more thrust than the v1.0 version of the Falcon 9.&#91;63&#93; It includes realigned first-stage engines&#91;72&#93; and 60 percent longer fuel tanks, making it more susceptible to bending during flight.&#91;63&#93; Development testing of the v1.1 first stage was completed in July 2013.&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93; The Falcon 9 v1.1, first launched in September 2013, uses a longer first stage powered by nine Merlin 1D engines arranged in an "octagonal" pattern,&#91;75&#93;&#91;76&#93; that SpaceX calls Octaweb. This is designed to simplify and streamline the manufacturing process.&#91;77&#93;
The v1.1 first stage has a total sea-level thrust at liftoff of 5,885 ;kN (1,323,000 ;lbf), with the nine engines burning for a nominal 180 seconds, while stage thrust rises to 6,672 ;kN (1,500,000 ;lbf) as the booster climbs out of the atmosphere.&#91;4&#93; The engines have been upgraded to the more powerful Merlin 1D. These improvements increased the payload capability from 9,000 ;kg (20,000 ;lb) to 13,150 ;kg (28,990 ;lb).&#91;4&#93; The stage separation system has been redesigned and reduces the number of attachment points from twelve to three,&#91;63&#93; and the vehicle has upgraded avionics and software as well.&#91;63&#93; Following the September 2013 launch, the second stage igniter propellant lines were insulated to better support in-space restart following long coast phases for orbital trajectory maneuvers.&#91;48&#93;
SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell has stated the Falcon 9 v1.1 has about 30 percent more payload capacity than published on its standard price list, the extra margin reserved for returning of stages via powered re-entry.&#91;78&#93; Four extensible carbon fiber with aluminum honeycomb landing legs were included on later flights where landings were attempted.&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93;
 
The v1.2 upgrade, also known as "Full Thrust",&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93; has cryogenic cooling of propellant to increase density allowing 17% higher thrust, an improved stage separation system, a stretched upper stage that can hold additional propellant, and strengthened struts for holding helium bottles believed to have been involved with the failure of flight 19.&#91;84&#93;
SpaceX pricing and payload specifications published for the Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket as of March ;2014&#91;update&#93; actually included about 30 percent more performance than the published price list indicated; the additional performance was reserved for SpaceX to perform reusability testing with the Falcon 9 v1.1 while still achieving the specified payloads for customers. Many engineering changes to support reusability and recovery of the first stage had been made on the v1.1 version and testing was successful, with SpaceX able to increase the payload performance for the Full Thrust version, or decrease launch price, or both.&#91;85&#93;
The Full Thrust version of the rocket has a reusable first stage after achieving its first successful landing in December 2015&#91;86&#93; and the first reflight in March 2017.&#91;87&#93; However, plans to reuse the Falcon 9 second-stage booster have been abandoned as the weight of a heat shield and other equipment would impinge on payload too much for this to be economically feasible for this rocket.&#91;17&#93; The reusable booster stage was developed using systems and software tested on the Falcon 9 prototypes, as well as a set of technologies being developed by SpaceX to facilitate rapid reusability.
In February 2017, SpaceX's CRS-10 launch was the first operational launch utilizing the new Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) built into Falcon 9 Full Thrust launch vehicles. For all SpaceX launches after March 16, 2017, the autonomous AFSS has replaced "the ground-based mission flight control personnel and equipment with on-board Positioning, Navigation and Timing sources and decision logic.  The benefits of AFSS include increased public safety, reduced reliance on range infrastructure, reduced range spacelift cost, increased schedule predictability and availability, operational flexibility, and launch slot flexibility."&#91;88&#93;
On the June 25, 2017, a space mission carried the second batch of ten Iridium NEXT satellites, during which their aluminum grid fins were replaced by titanium versions, to improve control authority and better heat tolerance during re-entry.&#91;89&#93;
In 2017, SpaceX started including incremental changes to the Falcon 9 Full Thrust, internally calling it the "Block 4" version.&#91;90&#93;  Initially, only the second stage was modified to Block 4 standards, flying on top of a "Block 3" first stage for three missions: NROL-76 and Inmarsat-5 F4 in May 2017, and Intelsat 35e in July.&#91;91&#93; Block 4 was described as a transition between the Full Thrust v1.2 "Block 3" and Block 5. It includes incremental engine thrust upgrades leading to the final thrust for Block 5.&#91;92&#93; The maiden flight of the full Block 4 design (first and second stages) was the NASA CRS-12 mission on August 14, 2017.&#91;93&#93;
In October 2016, Musk described a Block 5 version that would have "a lot of minor refinements that collectively are important, but uprated thrust and improved legs are the most significant."&#91;94&#93; In January 2017, Musk added that the Block 5 version "significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability".&#91;95&#93; He described this version as the "final" version of the rocket.&#91;94&#93; The maiden flight took place on May 11, 2018,&#91;23&#93; with the Bangabandhu-1 satellite.&#91;96&#93;  The Block 5 version of the second stage includes upgrades that enable it to operate for longer in orbit and reignite its engine three or more times.&#91;97&#93;
SpaceX had predicted that its launches would have high reliability based on the philosophy that "through simplicity, reliability and low cost can go hand-in-hand" by 2011.&#91;110&#93; As of 30 May 2020, the Falcon 9 has achieved 86 out of 88 full mission successes (97.7%), with SpaceX CRS-1 succeeding in the primary mission but leaving a secondary payload in a wrong orbit and SpaceX CRS-7 destroyed in flight. In addition Amos-6 was destroyed on the launch pad during fueling for an engine test. For comparison, present industry benchmark, the Russian Soyuz series has performed more than 1,700 launches&#91;111&#93; with a success rate of 97.4%,&#91;112&#93; the Russian Proton series has performed 422 launches a success rate of 88.6%, the European Ariane 5 has performed 105 launches with a success rate of 95.2%, and Chinese Long March 3B has performed 67 launches with a success rate of 94%.
As with the company's smaller Falcon 1 vehicle, Falcon 9's launch sequence includes a hold-down feature that allows full engine ignition and systems check before liftoff. After first-stage engine start, the launcher is held down and not released for flight until all propulsion and vehicle systems are confirmed to be operating normally. Similar hold-down systems have been used on other launch vehicles such as the Saturn V&#91;113&#93; and Space Shuttle. An automatic safe shut-down and unloading of propellant occur if any abnormal conditions are detected.&#91;5&#93; Prior to the launch date, SpaceX always completes a test of the Falcon 9, culminating in a firing of the first stage's Merlin 1D engines for three-and-a-half seconds to verify performance.&#91;114&#93;
Falcon 9 has triple-redundant flight computers and inertial navigation, with a GPS overlay for additional orbit insertion accuracy.&#91;5&#93;
Like the Saturn rocket series from the Apollo program, the presence of multiple first-stage engines allows for mission completion even if one of the first-stage engines fails during flight.&#91;5&#93;&#91;115&#93; Detailed descriptions of several aspects of destructive engine failure modes and designed-in engine-out capabilities were made public by SpaceX in a 2007 "update" that was publicly released.&#91;116&#93;
SpaceX emphasized over several years that the Falcon 9 first stage is designed for engine out capability.&#91;5&#93; The SpaceX CRS-1 mission in October 2012 was a partial success after an engine failure in the first stage: engine no. ;1 experienced a loss of pressure at 79 seconds, and then shut down. To compensate for the resulting loss of acceleration, the first stage had to burn 28 seconds longer than planned, and the second stage had to burn an extra 15 seconds. That extra burn time of the second stage reduced its fuel reserves, so that the likelihood that there was sufficient fuel to reach the planned orbit above the space station with the secondary payload dropped from 99% to 95%. Because NASA had purchased the launch and therefore contractually controlled several mission decision points, NASA declined SpaceX's request to restart the second stage and attempt to deliver the secondary payload into the correct orbit. The secondary payload customer understood this risk at time of the signing of the launch contract. As a result, the secondary payload satellite reentered the atmosphere a few days after launch.&#91;8&#93;
On a March 18, 2020 Starlink mission, one of the first stage engines failed 3 seconds before the main engine cut-off. The payload was inserted into the correct orbit, but the booster recovery failed. SpaceX stated in the webcast of the next Starlink mission that the engine had failed due to the ignition of some isopropyl alcohol that was not properly purged after cleaning the engine.&#91;117&#93;
SpaceX intended to recover the first stages of several early Falcon flights to assist engineers in designing for future reusability. They were equipped with parachutes but failed to survive the aerodynamic stress and heating during atmospheric re-entry following stage separation.&#91;71&#93; Although reusability of the second stage is more difficult, SpaceX intended from the beginning to make both stages of the Falcon 9 reusable.&#91;118&#93; Both stages in the early launches were covered with a layer of ablative cork and had parachutes to land them gently in the sea. The stages were also marinized by salt-water corrosion-resistant material, anodizing and paying attention to galvanic corrosion.&#91;118&#93; Musk said that if the vehicle does not become reusable, "I will consider us to have failed."&#91;119&#93;
In late 2011, SpaceX announced a change in the approach, eliminating the parachutes and going with a propulsively-powered-descent approach.&#91;120&#93;&#91;121&#93; Included was a video&#91;122&#93; said to be an approximation depicting the first stage returning tail-first for a powered descent and the second stage, with heat shield, reentering head first before rotating for a powered descent.&#91;121&#93;&#91;123&#93; The design was complete on the system for "bringing the rocket back to launchpad using only thrusters" by February 2012.&#91;62&#93;
A reusable first stage was then flight-tested by SpaceX with the suborbital Grasshopper rocket.&#91;124&#93; Between 2012 and 2013, this low-altitude, low-speed demonstration test vehicle made eight VTVL test flights, including a 79-second round-trip flight to an altitude of 744 ;m (2,441 ;ft). In March 2013, SpaceX announced that beginning with the first flight of the Falcon 9 v1.1 (the sixth flight overall of Falcon 9), every first stage would be instrumented and equipped as a controlled descent test vehicle. SpaceX continued their propulsive-return over-water tests, saying they "will continue doing such tests until they can do a return to the launch site and a powered landing. ... [SpaceX] expect several failures before they 'learn how to do it right.'"&#91;80&#93;
For Falcon 9 Flight 6 in September 2013, after stage separation, the flight test plan called for the first-stage booster to first burn to reduce its reentry velocity, and then effect a second burn just before it reached the water. SpaceX stated they expected several powered-descent tests to achieve successful recovery,&#91;81&#93; before they could then attempt a landing on a solid surface.&#91;80&#93; Although not a complete success, the stage was able to change direction and make a controlled entry into the atmosphere.&#91;125&#93; During the final landing burn, the ACS thrusters could not overcome an aerodynamically induced spin. The centrifugal force deprived the landing engine of fuel leading to early engine shutdown and a hard splashdown that destroyed the first stage.&#91;125&#93;
After four more ocean landing tests, the first stage of the CRS-5 launch vehicle attempted a landing on a floating landing platform, the "Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship" (ASDS) in January 2015. The rocket incorporated (for the first time in an orbital mission) grid fin aerodynamic control surfaces, and guided itself to the ship successfully, but ran out of hydraulic fluid and lost its steering ability, destroying it on impact with the landing platform.&#91;126&#93; A second attempt to land on a floating platform occurred in April 2015, on CRS-6. After the launch, Elon Musk communicated that the bipropellant valve had become stuck, and therefore the control system could not react rapidly enough for a successful landing.&#91;127&#93;
The first attempt to land the first stage of Falcon 9 on a ground pad near the launch site occurred on flight 20, the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust version in December 2015. The landing was successful and the first stage was recovered.&#91;128&#93;&#91;129&#93; This was the first time in history that a rocket first stage returned to Earth after propelling an orbital launch mission and achieving a controlled vertical landing. The first successful first-stage landing on an ASDS occurred in April 2016 on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You during the CRS-8 mission.
In total, sixteen test flights were conducted from 2013 to 2016, six of which achieved a soft landing and recovery of the booster. Since January 2017, SpaceX has stopped referring to landing attempts as "experimental" in their press releases, indicating that they are now considered a routine procedure; with the exceptions of the center core from the Falcon Heavy Test Flight, Falcon Heavy USAF STP-2 mission, the Falcon 9 CRS-16 resupply mission and the Starlink 5 mission, every landing attempt since has been successful. Only post-landing loss of first stage occurred on Falcon Heavy Arabsat-6A after center core fell over due to high seas.
The first operational reuse of a previously-flown Falcon 9 booster was accomplished in March 2017&#91;130&#93; with B1021 on the SES-10 mission after CRS-8 in April 2016.&#91;131&#93; The booster landed a second time and was retired.&#91;132&#93; In June 2017, booster B1029 helped carry BulgariaSat-1 towards GTO after an Iridium NEXT LEO mission in January, again achieving the reuse and second landing of a recovered booster.&#91;133&#93; The third flight of a reused booster was first performed in November 2018 on the SSO-A mission. The core for the mission, B1046, was the first Block 5 booster produced, flown initially on the Bangabandhu-1 mission.&#91;134&#93;
Payload fairings have survived descent and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. In June 2015, wreckage of an unidentified Falcon 9 launch vehicle was found off the coast of The Bahamas, which was confirmed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to be a component of the payload fairing that washed ashore. Musk noted the possibility of fairing reusability in a statement: "This is helpful for figuring out fairing reusability."&#91;138&#93; In March 2017, SpaceX for the first time recovered a fairing from the SES-10 mission, aided by thrusters and a steerable parachute helping it glide towards a gentle touchdown on water.&#91;56&#93;
On April 11, 2019, SpaceX recovered both fairing halves during the Arabsat-6A mission. Following stage separation, the fairing pieces were ejected and fell back to Earth. The pieces landed in the Atlantic Ocean intact and were recovered by the SpaceX recovery teams. Following recovery, Elon Musk tweeted that the fairing halves were successfully recovered and were going to be refurbished for a Starlink launch.&#91;139&#93; Starting in June 2019 SpaceX managed to catch fairing parts with a big net on a ship, avoiding contact with corrosive saltwater.&#91;140&#93;
In November 2018, SpaceX announced work on a heavily modified Falcon 9 second stage that would be used for atmospheric reentry testing of a number of technologies needed for the full-scale Starship, including an ultra-light heat shield and high-Mach control surfaces.  Musk indicated it would be "upgraded to be like a mini-BFR ship" but that the stage would not be used for landing tests, as the company already believes it has a good handle on propulsive landings.  In November 2018, the first test flight of the modified stage was planned to be no earlier than mid-2019.&#91;141&#93; In the event, the design work did not proceed all the way to flight testing, and no reentry tests were done using a returning Falcon 9 second stage.  All SpaceX second stage design/development work for atmospheric reentry moved to the two Starship orbital prototype vehicles.&#91;142&#93;
By early 2018, Falcon 9 was regularly launching from three orbital launch sites: Launch Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center,&#91;143&#93; Space Launch Complex 4E of the Vandenberg Air Force Base,&#91;119&#93;&#91;125&#93; and Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station; the latter was damaged in the Amos-6 accident in September 2016, but was operational again by December 2017.&#91;144&#93;&#91;145&#93; SpaceX is also building a commercial-only launch facility at the Boca Chica site near Brownsville, Texas.&#91;146&#93;&#91;51&#93; Although originally projected as a fourth Falcon 9 launch facility, SpaceX had abandoned that plan by late 2018 and the Boca Chica site was being used for testing of SpaceX Starship prototypes.
At the time of the rocket's maiden flight in 2010, the price of a Falcon 9 v1.0 launch was listed from $49.9 to $56 ;million.&#91;5&#93; By 2012, the listed price range had increased to $54–$59.5 ;million.&#91;147&#93; In August 2013, the initial list price for a Falcon 9 v1.1 was $56.5 ;million;&#91;148&#93; it was raised to $61.2 ;million by June 2014.&#91;149&#93; Since May 2016, the standard price for a Falcon 9 Full Thrust mission (allowing booster recovery) is published as $62 ;million.&#91;1&#93; Dragon cargo missions to the ISS have an average cost of $133 ;million under a fixed-price contract with NASA, including the cost of the capsule.&#91;150&#93; The DSCOVR mission, also launched with Falcon 9 for NOAA, cost $97 ;million.&#91;151&#93;
In 2004, Elon Musk stated, "long term plans call for development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand. [...] Ultimately, I believe $500 per pound ($1100/kg) [of payload delivered to orbit] or less is very achievable."&#91;152&#93; At its 2016 launch price and at full LEO payload capacity, a Falcon 9 FT launch costs just over $2,700 per kilogram ($1,200/lb) when expended.
In 2011, Musk estimated that fuel and oxidizer for the Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket cost a total of about $200,000.&#91;153&#93; The first stage uses 245,620 ;L (64,885 ;US ;gal) of liquid oxygen and 146,020 ;L (38,575 ;US ;gal) of RP-1 fuel,&#91;154&#93; while the second stage uses 28,000 ;L (7,300 ;US ;gal) of liquid oxygen and 17,000 ;L (4,600 ;US ;gal) of RP-1.&#91;1&#93;
By 2018, the Falcon 9's decreased launch costs has led to competitors developing new rockets. Arianespace is working on Ariane 6, ULA on Vulcan, and ILS on Proton Medium.&#91;155&#93;
On June 26, 2019, Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX's vice president of commercial sales said that previously discounted pricing SpaceX gave to early customers of Falcon 9 missions with pre-flown first-stage boosters is now the company's normal pricing.&#91;2&#93; In October 2019, data from NASA's Space Intel Report showed that the Falcon 9's 'base price' of $62 ;million per launch is nearer $52 ;million, which will be applied for launches in 2021 and beyond.&#91;156&#93;
On April 10, 2020, Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, said they were cutting the price of launches by 30% as he alleged that SpaceX was price dumping, charging commercial customers $60M per flight while charging NASA between 1.5 and 4x as much for the same flight.&#91;157&#93; SpaceX's CEO, Elon Musk, denied such a claim and replied that the actual cause is that the Falcon 9s are 80% reusable, while Russian rockets are expendable.&#91;158&#93;
Falcon 9 payload services include secondary and tertiary payload connection via an EELV Secondary Payload Adapter ring, the same interstage adapter first used for launching secondary payloads on US DoD missions that use the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELV) Atlas V and Delta IV. This enables secondary and even tertiary missions with minimal impact to the original mission. In 2011, SpaceX announced pricing for ESPA-compatible payloads on the Falcon 9.&#91;159&#93;
SpaceX first put a Falcon 9 on public display at their headquarters in Hawthorne, California, in 2016.&#91;160&#93;
In 2019, SpaceX donated a Falcon 9 to Space Center Houston, in Houston, Texas.  It was a booster that flew two missions, "the 11th and 13th supply missions to the International Space Station [and was] the first Falcon 9 rocket NASA agreed to fly a second time."  It will be displayed horizontally, beginning in 2020.&#91;161&#93;

Crew Dragon Demo-2 (officially SpaceX Demo-2)&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; is a crewed flight test of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, which launched on 30 May 2020 at 3:22:45 ;p.m. EDT (19:22:45 UTC).&#91;2&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; The first attempt to launch on 27 May 2020 was aborted at T−16:53 minutes due to bad weather caused by Tropical Storm Bertha.&#91;11&#93; Demo-2 is the first crewed orbital spaceflight launched from the United States since the final Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, in 2011, and also the first crewed orbital flight ever operated by a commercial provider.&#91;12&#93; The mission launched spacecraft commander Douglas Hurley and joint-operations commander Robert Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft soft-docked with the ISS on 31 May 2020 at 10:16 ;a.m. EDT (14:16 UTC), slightly earlier than the scheduled time of 10:29 ;a.m. EDT (14:29 UTC). The live stream was watched online by 3 million people on NASA feeds,&#91;13&#93; and the SpaceX feed peaked at 4.1 million viewers. NASA estimated roughly 10 million people watched on various online platforms, approximately 150,000 people gathered on Florida's space coast&#91;14&#93; in addition to an unknown number watching on television. The Crew Dragon capsule used in the launch was named Endeavour, in honor of its namesake Space Shuttle.
After STS-135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the United States' NASA no longer had any spacecraft system capable of sending humans to space. Subsequently, it used Russian facilities to send its astronauts into the International Space Station (ISS), costing up to $80 million per astronaut with the Soyuz. NASA started engaging with private companies like SpaceX as an alternative, which is expected to cost 50% less than Soyuz once the Commercial Crew Program is in regular operation.&#91;15&#93; Up to the launch, NASA has awarded a total of $3.1 ;billion for the development of the Dragon.&#91;16&#93; The Demo-2 mission is expected to be SpaceX's last major test before NASA certifies it for regular crewed spaceflights.&#91;12&#93; Prior to that, SpaceX had sent twenty cargo missions to the ISS, but never a crewed one.&#91;16&#93; Other than SpaceX, Boeing is also working on crewed orbital spaceflight under the same NASA effort.&#91;12&#93;
Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken were announced as the primary crew on 3 August 2018.&#91;17&#93; Both astronauts are veterans of the Space Shuttle program,&#91;18&#93; and the Demo-2 flight is the third trip to space for both of them. Hurley served as pilot on STS-135, thus flying on the last shuttle mission, and is piloting the first commercial crew mission. The lead Flight Director for this mission is Zebulon Scoville.&#91;19&#93; Additionally, the crew brought along a toy Apatosaurus dinosaur named "Tremor", a Ty flippables plush toy they had selected from their sons' toys. As in past space missions, the plush toy had been used as an indication of zero gravity for the strapped-in astronauts. Behnken and Hurley said, "That was a super cool thing for us to get a chance to do for both of our sons who I hope are super excited to see their toys floating around with us on board."&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;
NASA calculated the Loss Of Crew (LOC) probability for the test flight as 1-in-276, lower than the commercial crew program requirement threshold of 1-in-270. The 1-in-276 number includes mitigations to reduce the risk, such as on-orbit inspections of the Crew Dragon spacecraft once it is docked at the space station to look for damage from micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). NASA pegs the overall risk of a Loss Of Mission (LOM) as 1-in-60. That risk covers scenarios where the Crew Dragon does not reach the space station as planned, but the crew safely returns to Earth.&#91;22&#93; NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren was the sole backup crew member for the flight, backing up both Hurley and Behnken for the mission.&#91;23&#93;
The mission insignia was designed by Andrew Nyberg, an artist from Brainerd, Minnesota, who is a nephew of spacecraft commander Hurley.&#91;25&#93; The insignia features the logos of the Commercial Crew Program, Falcon 9, Crew Dragon, and the red chevron of NASA's "meatball" insignia. Also depicted are the American flag and a symbol of the ISS. The words NASA, SpaceX, Hurley and Behnken are printed around the border, along with the words "First crewed flight" and DM-2. The insignia outline is in the shape of the Crew Dragon capsule.&#91;26&#93; The Falcon 9 rocket displays NASA's worm logo. This is the first time the logo has been used officially since it was retired in 1992.&#91;27&#93; NASA TV and media coverage of the launch was branded as "Launch America", with its own logo.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93;
The Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was intended to complete the validation of crewed spaceflight operations using SpaceX hardware.&#91;30&#93; If successful, the demonstration flight will allow for human-rating certification of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, the Falcon 9 rocket, the crew transportation system, the launch pad, and SpaceX's capabilities. The mission includes astronaut testing of Crew Dragon capabilities on orbit.&#91;31&#93; The Crew Dragon capsule launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A on 30 May 2020, and docked to pressurized mating adapter PMA-2 on the Harmony module of the ISS on 31 May 2020.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93; It was the first American crewed launch of a space capsule since the ASTP Apollo. The first stage booster landed autonomously on the floating barge Of Course I Still Love You, which was prepositioned in the Atlantic Ocean.&#91;34&#93; Docking and undocking operations were autonomously controlled by the Crew Dragon, but monitored by the flight crew in case manual intervention becomes necessary.&#91;24&#93; Upon returning to Earth, the Crew Dragon capsule will splash down into the Atlantic Ocean, where it will be recovered by the GO Navigator recovery vessel.&#91;24&#93;
Douglas Hurley and Robert Behnken will work alongside the crew of Expedition 63 for 30 to 90 days, meaning the landing of the spacecraft will occur no later than 28 August 2020.&#91;18&#93; During their time aboard, Behnken is expected to conduct spacewalks with fellow American astronaut Chris Cassidy to replace batteries brought up by a Japanese cargo vehicle.&#91;35&#93; The HTV-9 cargo vehicle was berthed on May 25, it carried the final set of six lithium-ion batteries to replace the aging nickel-hydrogen ones.&#91;36&#93;
The Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was initially planned for launch in July 2019 as part of the Commercial Crew Development contract with a crew of two on a 14-day test mission to the ISS.&#91;37&#93;&#91;17&#93; The Crew Dragon capsule from the Crew Dragon Demo-1 mission was destroyed while its SuperDraco thrusters were undergoing static fire testing on 20 April 2019, ahead of its planned use for the in-flight abort test.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93; SpaceX traced the cause of the anomaly to a component that leaked oxidizer into the high-pressure helium lines, which then solidified and damaged a valve. The valves have since been switched for burst discs to prevent another anomaly.&#91;40&#93; On 19 January 2020, a Crew Dragon capsule successfully completed an in-flight abort test.&#91;41&#93; The NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said 9 April 2020 that he is "fairly confident" that astronauts can fly to the ISS aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship at the end of May or in early June 2020, pending final parachute tests, data reviews and a training schedule that can escape major impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.&#91;42&#93;
On 17 April 2020, NASA and SpaceX announced the launch date as 27 May 2020.&#91;31&#93; The arrival of the Crew Dragon will raise the station's crew size from three to five. Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will perform duties and conduct experiments as crew on board the ISS for several months, until the next Crew Dragon launch. Hurley and Behnken are expected to live and work aboard the space station for two or three months, and then return to Earth for a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean east of Cape Canaveral.&#91;31&#93;&#91;43&#93; NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine urged space enthusiasts not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center to view the launch and asked people to instead watch the launch on television or online. Bridenstine explained that maintenance crews are working in cohesive shifts, to mitigate workers' exposure to SARS-CoV-2.&#91;44&#93; On 1 May 2020, SpaceX successfully demonstrated the Mark 3 parachute system, a critical milestone for the mission approval.&#91;45&#93; Crew Dragon Demo-2 has marked the first crewed US spaceflight mission not to include the presence of the public at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#91;46&#93; As the mission was previously delayed, the Visitor Complex has opened as of 28 May 2020 with limited capacity for publicly viewing the launch. Admissions sold out almost immediately.&#91;47&#93; To engage the public, notably the Class of 2020, who were unable to attend their graduations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both NASA and SpaceX invited students and graduates to submit their photos to be flown to the ISS.&#91;48&#93;
Behnken and Hurley arrived at Kennedy Space Center on 20 May 2020 in preparation for the launch. On 21 May, the Falcon 9 rocket was rolled out to the launch pad, and a static fire test was conducted on 22 May 2020; a major milestone ahead of the launch.&#91;49&#93; The mission used a Tesla Model X to transport Hurley and Behnken to LC-39A.&#91;50&#93; An official launch weather forecast for Dragon Crew Demo-2 by the 45th Weather Squadron of the U.S. Space Force, for the original launch time at 20:33:33 UTC on 27 May 2020, predicted a 50% probability of favorable conditions. The launch was scrubbed at T−16:53 minutes due to thunderstorms and light rain in the area. The second launch attempt was successful and took place on 30 May 2020 at 19:22:45 UTC with a 50% probability of favorable conditions.&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93; The other launch windows were 31 May 2020 at 19:00:07 UTC, with a 60% probability of favorable conditions and 2 June 2020 at 18:13 UTC with a 70% probability of favorable conditions.&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93; President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, with their wives, were at Kennedy Space Center in Florida to see the launch attempt on 27 May 2020,&#91;55&#93; and returned for launch on 30 May 2020, along with the Second Lady Karen Pence.&#91;54&#93;&#91;56&#93;
All times in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4).
Astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken revealed the name of their Crew Dragon spacecraft (capsule 206), Endeavour, shortly after launch.&#91;57&#93; It is the third US spacecraft named Endeavour, after the Space Shuttle orbiter of the same name built in 1991 to replace Space Shuttle Challenger, which was destroyed in 1986,&#91;58&#93; and the Apollo command and service module used for the Apollo 15 mission in 1971.&#91;59&#93; Hurley said that they chose Endeavour as both his and Behnken's first flights to space were on the Space Shuttle Endeavour.&#91;6&#93; The craft spent 19 hours in orbit as it approached the ISS. As they approached the ISS, Hurley demonstrated the ability to pilot the spacecraft via its touchscreen controls until it reached a distance of 220 metres (720 ;ft) from the ISS docking ports, at which point they let the automated docking program take over. Endeavour docked with the ISS at 14:29 UTC on 31 May 2020.&#91;6&#93; The hatch was opened and Hurley and Behnken boarded the ISS at 18:22 UTC.&#91;6&#93;&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93; Hurley and Behnken joined the ISS Expedition 63 crew, which consists of NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Ivan Vagner and Anatoli Ivanishin.&#91;62&#93; Hurley and Behnken are expected to stay on the ISS from six to sixteen weeks, depending on NASA's mission directives.&#91;6&#93;
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts' families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.&#91;65&#93;

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA /ˈnæsə/) is an independent agency of the United States Federal Government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and space research.&#91;note 1&#93;
NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful applications in space science.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System, and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.
NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System;&#91;11&#93; advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program;&#91;12&#93; exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons;&#91;13&#93; and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.&#91;14&#93;
Since 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1.&#91;15&#93; In the early 1950s, there was a challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58), resulting in the American Project Vanguard among others. After the Soviet launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a "Special Committee on Space Technology", headed by Guyford Stever.&#91;10&#93; On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden published "A National Research Program for Space Technology" stating:&#91;16&#93;
While this new federal agency would conduct all non-military space activity, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in February 1958 to develop space technology for military application.&#91;17&#93;
On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 43-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100 ;million, three major research laboratories (Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory) and two small test facilities.&#91;18&#93; A NASA seal was approved by President Eisenhower in 1959.&#91;19&#93; Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into NASA. A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the Space Race with the Soviet Union was the technology from the German rocket program led by Wernher von Braun, who was now working for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), which in turn incorporated the technology of American scientist Robert Goddard's earlier works.&#91;20&#93; Earlier research efforts within the US Air Force&#91;18&#93; and many of ARPA's early space programs were also transferred to NASA.&#91;21&#93; In December 1958, NASA gained control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California Institute of Technology.&#91;18&#93;
The agency's leader, NASA's administrator, is nominated by the President of the United States subject to approval of the US Senate, and reports to him or her and serves as senior space science advisor. Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually is associated with the President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only exceptions to this have been:
The first administrator was Dr. T. Keith Glennan appointed by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower. During his term he brought together the disparate projects in American space development research.&#91;24&#93;
The second administrator, James E. Webb (1961–1968), appointed by President John F. Kennedy, was a Democrat who first publicly served under President Harry S. Truman. In order to implement the Apollo program to achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.
James Fletcher was responsible for early planning of the Space Shuttle program during his first term as administrator under President Nixon. He was appointed for a second term as administrator from May 1986 through April 1989 by President Ronald Reagan to help the agency recover from the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.
Former astronaut Charles Bolden served as NASA's twelfth administrator from July 2009 to January 20, 2017.&#91;25&#93; Bolden is one of three former astronauts who became NASA administrators, along with Richard H. Truly (served 1989–1992) and Frederick D. Gregory (acting, 2005).
The agency's administration is located at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC and provides overall guidance and direction.&#91;26&#93; Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be citizens of the United States.&#91;27&#93;
NASA has conducted many crewed and uncrewed spaceflight programs throughout its history. Uncrewed programs launched the first American artificial satellites into Earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with Venus and Mars, and including "grand tours" of the outer planets. Crewed programs sent the first Americans into low Earth orbit (LEO), won the Space Race with the Soviet Union by landing twelve men on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 in the Apollo program, developed a semi-reusable LEO Space Shuttle, and developed LEO space station capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-Soviet Russia. Some missions include both crewed and uncrewed aspects, such as the Galileo probe, which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent uncrewed to Jupiter.
The experimental rocket-powered aircraft programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for crewed spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the Soviet Union, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal "of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth." This goal was met in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a human mission to Mars. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 crewed space missions on rockets, and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight altitude, 260,000 feet (80 ;km).&#91;29&#93;
The North American X-15 was an NACA experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems.&#91;30&#93; Requests for proposal were issued on December 30, 1954, for the airframe, and February 4, 1955, for the rocket engine. The airframe contract was awarded to North American Aviation in November 1955, and the XLR30 engine contract was awarded to Reaction Motors in 1956, and three planes were built. The X-15 was drop-launched from the wing of one of two NASA Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, NB52A tail number 52-003, and NB52B, tail number 52-008 (known as the Balls 8). Release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 feet (14 ;km) and a speed of about 500 miles per hour (805 ;km/h).
Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and NACA (later NASA). A total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968, resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a crewed powered aircraft (current as of 2014&#91;update&#93;), and a maximum speed of Mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273 ;km/h).&#91;31&#93; The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 ;km).&#91;32&#93; Eight of the pilots were awarded Air Force astronaut wings for flying above 260,000 feet (80 ;km), and two flights by Joseph A. Walker exceeded 100 kilometers (330,000 ;ft), qualifying as spaceflight according to the International Aeronautical Federation. The X-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later crewed spaceflight programs, including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft, space suits, and horizon definition for navigation.&#91;32&#93; The reentry and landing data collected were valuable to NASA for designing the Space Shuttle.&#91;30&#93;
Shortly after the Space Race began, an early objective was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. The US Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program considered many crewed spacecraft designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space capsules.&#91;33&#93; By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule.&#91;34&#93;
When NASA was created that same year, the Air Force program was transferred to it and renamed Project Mercury. The first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space aboard Freedom ;7, launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic (suborbital) flight.&#91;35&#93; John Glenn became the first American to be launched into orbit, by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962, aboard Friendship ;7.&#91;36&#93; Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit flight Faith 7, May 15–16, 1963.&#91;37&#93; Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan were three of the human computers doing calculations on trajectories during the Space Race.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; Johnson was well known for doing trajectory calculations for John Glenn's mission in 1962, where she was running the same equations by hand that were being run on the computer.&#91;38&#93;
The Soviet Union (USSR) competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft, Vostok. They sent the first man in space, by launching cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into a single Earth orbit aboard Vostok 1 in April 1961, one month before Shepard's flight.&#91;41&#93; In August 1962, they achieved an almost four-day record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok 3, and also conducted a concurrent Vostok 4 mission carrying Pavel Popovich.
Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo crewed lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965.&#91;42&#93; Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93;
Under the direction of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the USSR competed with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man Voskhod. They succeeded in launching two crewed flights before Gemini's first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1964 and the first EVA in 1965. After this, the program was canceled, and Gemini caught up while spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev developed the Soyuz spacecraft, their answer to Apollo.
The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated&#91;45&#93; President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961, to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo program.&#91;46&#93;
Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 ;billion in 1960s dollars&#91;47&#93; or an estimated $223 ;billion in present-day US dollars.&#91;48&#93; (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $28.4 ;billion, accounting for inflation.)&#91;48&#93;&#91;49&#93; It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.&#91;50&#93; The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.&#91;note 2&#93;
The second crewed mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968.&#91;51&#93; Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an uncrewed spacecraft around the Moon.&#91;52&#93; On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93; and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.&#91;55&#93;
The first person to walk on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed 19 minutes later by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms (842 ;lb) of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind.&#91;56&#93; The Moon landing marked the end of the space race; and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the Moon.&#91;57&#93;
Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body.&#91;58&#93; Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last crewed mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and crewed spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.
Skylab was the United States' first and only independently built space station.&#91;59&#93; Conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent Saturn IB upper stage, the 169,950 ;lb (77,088 ;kg) station was constructed on Earth and launched on May 14, 1973, atop the first two stages of a Saturn V, into a 235-nautical-mile (435 ;km) orbit inclined at 50° to the equator. Damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to functionality by its first crew. It was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974.&#91;59&#93; It included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity, and a solar observatory.&#91;59&#93; NASA planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it, and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude, but the Shuttle was not ready for flight before Skylab's re-entry on July 11, 1979.&#91;60&#93;
To save cost, NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab. Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station. Three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days. Skylab's habitable volume was 11,290 cubic feet (320 ;m3), which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the Apollo Command Module.&#91;60&#93;
On May 24, 1972, US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint crewed space mission, and declaring intent for all future international crewed spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other.&#91;61&#93; This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US crewed space flight until the first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.&#91;62&#93;
The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments and provided useful engineering experience for future joint US–Russian space flights, such as the Shuttle–Mir Program&#91;63&#93; and the International Space Station.
The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four Space Shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on April 12, 1981,&#91;64&#93; the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight.&#91;65&#93;
Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 ;km (115–400 miles)&#91;66&#93; and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 ;kg (54,000 ;lb).&#91;67&#93; Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.&#91;66&#93;
On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.&#91;68&#93; On June 18, 1983 Sally Ride became the first American woman in space, on board the Space Shuttle Challenger STS-7 mission.&#91;69&#93; Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.&#91;70&#93;
In 1995, Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003.&#91;71&#93; While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.&#91;71&#93; NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.&#91;72&#93;
The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's Space Station Freedom project with the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module.&#91;73&#93; NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).&#91;74&#93;&#91;75&#93; The station consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which were manufactured in various factories around the world, and have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space Shuttles.&#91;73&#93; It is currently&#91;when?&#93; being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment occurred in 2019 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is expected by 2020s.&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93;&#91;needs update&#93; The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements&#91;78&#93; which divide the station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93; with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.&#91;78&#93;
Long-duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.&#91;81&#93; The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.&#91;82&#93; Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.&#91;83&#93; The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 19 ;years and 214 ;days, having exceeded the previous record held by Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations.&#91;84&#93;&#91;85&#93;
The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2020, is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.&#91;86&#93; The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS; they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US crewed spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz.&#91;87&#93; The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.&#91;88&#93;
The ISS program is expected to continue to 2030.&#91;89&#93; On March 29, 2019, the ISS had its first all-female spacewalk; Anne McClain and Christina Koch will take flight during Women's History Month.&#91;90&#93;
The development of the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the ISS.&#91;91&#93; The development of these vehicles was under a fixed-price, milestone-based program, meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they did not receive until after they had successfully completed the milestone.&#91;92&#93; Companies were also required to raise an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal.&#91;93&#93;
On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services contracts to SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation.&#91;94&#93; SpaceX uses its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft.&#91;95&#93; Orbital Sciences uses its Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. The first Dragon resupply mission occurred in May 2012.&#91;96&#93; The first Cygnus resupply mission occurred in September 2013.&#91;97&#93; The CRS program now provides for all America's ISS cargo needs, with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the European ATV and the Japanese HTV.&#91;98&#93;
The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program was started in 2010 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth.&#91;99&#93; It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace.&#91;100&#93; Like COTS, CCDev is a fixed-price, milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.&#91;92&#93;
In 2010, when NASA announced the winners of the first phase of the program, a total of $50 ;million was divided among five American companies to foster research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector. In 2011, the winners of the second phase of the program were announced, and $270 ;million was divided among four companies.&#91;101&#93; In 2012, the winners of the third phase of the program were announced; NASA provided $1.1 ;billion divided among three companies to further develop their crew transportation systems.&#91;102&#93; In 2014, the winners of the final round were announced.&#91;103&#93; SpaceX Crew Dragon (launched on a Falcon 9 Block 5) received a contract valued up to $2.6 ;billion and Boeing's CST-100 (to be launched on an Atlas V) received a contract valued up to $4.2 ;billion.&#91;104&#93; NASA expects these vehicles to begin transporting humans to the ISS in 2020, with the launch of SpaceX Demo-2 on 30 May 2020.
While the Space Shuttle program was still suspended after the loss of Columbia, President George W. Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration including the retirement of the Space Shuttle after completing the International Space Station. The plan was enacted into law by the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 and directs NASA to develop and launch the Crew Exploration Vehicle (later called Orion) by 2010, return Americans to the Moon by 2020, return to Mars as feasible, repair the Hubble Space Telescope, and continue scientific investigation through robotic solar system exploration, human presence on the ISS, Earth observation, and astrophysics research. The crewed exploration goals prompted NASA's Constellation program.
After the Augustine Committee found that the Constellation program could not meet its goals without substantially more funding, in February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for it.&#91;105&#93; Obama's plan was to develop American private spaceflight capabilities to get astronauts to the International Space Station, replacing Russian Soyuz capsules, and to use Orion capsules for ISS emergency escape purposes. During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V.&#91;106&#93; In his speech, Obama called for a crewed mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a crewed mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s.&#91;106&#93; The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010.&#91;107&#93; The act officially canceled the Constellation program.&#91;107&#93;
The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 required a newly designed HLV be chosen within 90 days of its passing; the launch vehicle was given the name Space Launch System. The new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft.&#91;108&#93; The Orion spacecraft, which was being developed as part of the Constellation program, was chosen to fulfill this role.&#91;109&#93; The Space Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low Earth orbit.&#91;110&#93; The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. The initial capability of SLS is required to be able to lift 70 ;t (150,000 ;lb) (later 95 ;t or 209,000 ;lb) into LEO. It is then planned to be upgraded to 105 ;t (231,000 ;lb) and then eventually to 130 ;t (290,000 ;lb).&#91;109&#93;&#91;111&#93;  The Orion capsule first flew on Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), an uncrewed test flight that was launched on December 5, 2014, atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket.&#91;111&#93;
NASA undertook a feasibility study in 2012 and developed the Asteroid Redirect Mission as an uncrewed mission to move a boulder-sized near-Earth asteroid (or boulder-sized chunk of a larger asteroid) into lunar orbit. The mission would demonstrate ion thruster technology, and develop techniques that could be used for planetary defense against an asteroid collision, as well as cargo transport to Mars in support of a future human mission.  The Moon-orbiting boulder might then later be visited by astronauts. The Asteroid Redirect Mission was cancelled in 2017 as part of the FY2018 NASA budget, the first one under President Donald Trump.
Since 2017, NASA's crewed spaceflight program has been the Artemis program, which involves the help of U.S. commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as ESA.&#91;112&#93; The goal of this program is to land "the first woman and the next man" on the lunar south pole region by 2024. Artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars.
The Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle was held over from the canceled Constellation program for Artemis. Artemis 1 is the uncrewed initial launch of SLS that would also send an Orion spacecraft on a Distant Retrograde Orbit, which is planned to launch no earlier than November 2020.&#91;113&#93;
NASA's next major space initiative is to be the construction of the Lunar Gateway.  This initiative is to involve the construction of a new space station, which will have many features in common with the current International Space Station, except that it will be in orbit about the Moon, instead of the Earth.&#91;114&#93;  This space station will be designed primarily for non-continuous human habitation.  The first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be Artemis 2, which is to include the Orion crew module, propelled by the SLS, and is to launch in 2022.&#91;112&#93; This mission is to be a 10-day mission planned to briefly place a crew of four into a Lunar flyby.&#91;111&#93; The construction of the Gateway would begin with the proposed Artemis 3, which is planned to deliver a crew of four to Lunar orbit along with the first modules of the Gateway. This mission would last for up to 30 days. NASA plans to build full scale deep space habitats such as the Lunar Gateway and the Nautilus-X as part of its Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program.&#91;115&#93; In 2017, NASA was directed by the congressional NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 to get humans to Mars-orbit (or to the Martian surface) by 2030s.&#91;116&#93;&#91;117&#93;
On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced plans to also build a series of new X-planes over the next 10 years.&#91;118&#93; One of the planes will be the Quiet Supersonic Technology project, burning low-carbon biofuels and generating quiet sonic booms.&#91;118&#93;
More than 1,000 uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the solar system.&#91;119&#93; Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA.&#91;120&#93; The missions have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.
The first US uncrewed satellite was Explorer 1, which started as an ABMA/JPL project during the early part of the Space Race. It was launched in January 1958, two months after Sputnik. At the creation of NASA, the Explorer project was transferred to the agency and still continues to this day. Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun, measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind, among other aspects.&#91;121&#93; A more recent Earth mission, not related to the Explorer program, was the Hubble Space Telescope, which was brought into orbit in 1990.&#91;122&#93;
The inner Solar System has been made the goal of at least four uncrewed programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and 1970s, which made multiple visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2), to take the first pictures from another planet (Mariner 4), the first planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver (Mariner 10). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.&#91;123&#93;
The first successful landing on Mars was made by Viking 1 in 1976. Twenty years later a rover was landed on Mars by Mars Pathfinder.&#91;124&#93;
Outside Mars, Jupiter was first visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet.&#91;125&#93; Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.&#91;126&#93;
Pioneers 10 and 11 and both Voyager probes carry messages from the Earth to extraterrestrial life.&#91;127&#93;&#91;128&#93; Communication can be difficult with deep space travel. For instance, it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to Pluto.&#91;129&#93; Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.&#91;130&#93;
On November 26, 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission was successfully launched for Mars. Curiosity successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.&#91;131&#93;&#91;132&#93;&#91;133&#93;
NASA's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars (Perseverance and InSight) and Saturn and studies of the Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini (1997–2017), and Juno (2011–). In the early 2000s, NASA was put on course for the Moon, however, in 2010 this program was cancelled (see Constellation program). As part of that plan, the Shuttle was going to be replaced, however, although it was retired its replacement was also cancelled, leaving the US with no human spaceflight launcher for the first time in over three decades.
The New Horizons mission to Pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The probe received a gravity assist from Jupiter in February 2007, examining some of Jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby. On the horizon of NASA's plans is the MAVEN spacecraft as part of the Mars Scout Program to study the atmosphere of Mars.&#91;134&#93;
On December 4, 2006, NASA announced it was planning a permanent Moon base.&#91;135&#93; The goal was to start building the Moon base by 2020, and by 2024, have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and in-situ resource utilization. However, in 2009, the Augustine Committee found the program to be on an "unsustainable trajectory."&#91;136&#93; In 2010, President Barack Obama halted existing plans, including the Moon base, and directed a generic focus on crewed missions to asteroids and Mars, as well as extending support for the International Space Station.&#91;137&#93;
Since 2011, NASA's strategic goals have been&#91;138&#93;
In August 2011, NASA accepted the donation of two space telescopes from the National Reconnaissance Office. Despite being stored unused, the instruments are superior to the Hubble Space Telescope.&#91;139&#93;
In September 2011, NASA announced the start of the Space Launch System program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle. The Space Launch System is intended to launch the Orion spacecraft and other elements towards the Moon and Mars.&#91;140&#93; The Orion spacecraft conducted an uncrewed test launch on a Delta IV Heavy rocket in December 2014.&#91;141&#93;
On August 6, 2012, NASA landed the rover Curiosity on Mars. On August 27, 2012, Curiosity transmitted the first pre-recorded message from the surface of Mars back to Earth, made by Administrator Charlie Bolden:
Hello. This is Charlie Bolden, NASA Administrator, speaking to you via the broadcast capabilities of the Curiosity rover, which is now on the surface of Mars.
Since the beginning of time, humankind's curiosity has led us to constantly seek new life ... new possibilities just beyond the horizon. I want to congratulate the men and women of our NASA family as well as our commercial and government partners around the world, for taking us a step beyond to Mars.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is currently scheduled to launch in March 2021.&#91;143&#93;
In 1994, there was a Congressional directive to find near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 1 kilometer, and 90% of 1 kilometer sized asteroids are estimated to have been found by 2010.&#91;144&#93;
In 2005, the US Congress mandated NASA to achieve by the year 2020 specific levels of search completeness for discovering, cataloging, and characterizing dangerous asteroids larger than 140 meters (460 ;ft) (Act of 2005, H.R. 1022; 109th),&#91;145&#93;&#91;146&#93; but no new funds were appropriated for this effort.&#91;147&#93; As of January 2019, it is estimated about 40% of the NEOs of this size have been found, although since by its nature the exact amount of NEOs are unknown the calculations are based on predictions of how many there could be.&#91;148&#93;
Page 119 STAT. 2923
One issue with NEO prediction is trying to estimate how many more are likely to be found In 2000, NASA reduced its estimate of the number of existing near-Earth asteroids over one kilometer in diameter from 1,000–2,000 to 500–1,000.&#91;152&#93;&#91;153&#93; Shortly thereafter,  the LINEAR survey provided an alternative estimate of 1,227+170−90.&#91;154&#93; In 2011, on the basis of NEOWISE observations, the estimated number of one-kilometer NEAs was narrowed to 981±19 (of which 93% had been discovered at the time), while the number of NEAs larger than 140 meters across was estimated at 13,200±1,900.&#91;155&#93;&#91;156&#93; The NEOWISE estimate differed from other estimates in assuming a slightly lower average asteroid albedo, which produces larger estimated diameters for the same asteroid brightness. This resulted in 911 then known asteroids at least 1 ;km across, as opposed to the 830 then listed by CNEOS.&#91;157&#93; In 2017, using an improved statistical method, two studies reduced the estimated number of NEAs brighter than absolute magnitude 17.75 (approximately over one kilometer in diameter) to 921±20.&#91;158&#93;&#91;159&#93; The estimated number of asteroids brighter than absolute magnitude of 22.0 (approximately over 140 ;m across) rose to 27,100±2,200, double the WISE estimate,&#91;159&#93; of which about a third are known as of 2018. A problem with estimating the number of NEOs is that detections are influenced by a number of factors.&#91;160&#93; Observational biases need to be taken into account when trying to calculate the number of bodies in a population.&#91;160&#93;  What is easily detected will be more counted.&#91;161&#93;
For example, it has been easier to spot objects on the night-side of Earth.  There is less noise from twilight, and the searcher is looking at the sunlit side of the asteroids.  In the daytime sky, a searcher looking towards the sun sees the backside of the object (e.g. comparing a Full Moon at night to a New Moon in daytime).  In addition, opposition surge make them even brighter when the Earth is along the axis of sunlight. Finally, the day sky near the Sun is bright.&#91;161&#93; The light of sun hitting asteroids has been called "full asteroid" similar to a "full Moon" and the greater amount of light, creates a bias that makes them easier to detect in this case.&#91;161&#93;
Over half (53%) of the discoveries of Near Earth objects were made in 3.8% of the sky, in a 22.5° cone facing directly away from the Sun, and the vast majority (87%) were made in 15% of the sky, in a 45° cone facing away from the Sun.&#91;162&#93; 
NASA turned the infrared space survey telescope WISE back on in 2013 to look for NEOs, and it found some during the course of its operation. NEOcam competed in the highly competitive Discovery program, which became more so due to a low mission rate in the 2010s. Also the Mars Scout Program was terminated at that time, further increasing competition. From its start until 2010, ten missions where launched, only two more mission were launched by 2020 (to the Moon and Mars), additionally the Mars Scout program had launched two additional programs to the planet Mars, which competed with NEOcam as well as more obscure destinations like Venus, which has had no dedicated mission since the 1980s. Finally, NASA plans to turn off its existing Infrared Great Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2021 due to technical problems (It is drifting away from the Earth in an Earth-trailing orbit which means it must rotate at extreme angle to communicate with Earth, but keep its battery charge).
Two of the biggest Near-Earth objects, 433 Eros and 1036 Ganymed, were among the first Near Earth asteroids to be detected.&#91;163&#93; As bigger asteroids they reflected more light.&#91;161&#93;   The eccentric 433 asteroid was discovered by German astronomer Carl Gustav Witt at the Berlin Urania Observatory on August 13, 1898.&#91;164&#93; 1036 Ganymed is about 20 miles (35 ;km) in diameter,&#91;163&#93; and it was discovered by German astronomer Walter Baade at the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg on October 23, 1924.&#91;165&#93;&#91;166&#93; In 1999 NASA visited 433 Eros with the NEAR spacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000, closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time.&#91;167&#93; From the 1990s NASA has run many NEO detection programs from Earth bases observatories, greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected. However, many asteroids are very dark and the ones that are near the Sun are much harder to detect from Earth-based telescopes which observe at night, and thus face away from the Sun. NEOs inside Earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a "full Moon" when they are behind the Earth and fully lit by the Sun.
NASA's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) and Saturn and studies of the Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini (1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).
The New Horizons mission to Pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The probe received a gravity assist from Jupiter in February 2007, examining some of Jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby. On the horizon of NASA's plans is the MAVEN spacecraft as part of the Mars Scout Program to study the atmosphere of Mars.&#91;134&#93;
In 2017, President Donald Trump directed NASA to send Humans to Mars by the year 2033.&#91;116&#93;&#91;169&#93;  Foci in general for NASA were noted as human space exploration, space science, and technology.&#91;169&#93; The Europa Clipper and Mars 2020 continue to be supported for their planned schedules.&#91;170&#93;
In 2018, NASA along with other companies including Sensor Coating Systems, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Monitor Coating and UTRC  launched the project CAUTION (CoAtings for Ultra High Temperature detectION). This project aims to enhance the temperature range of the Thermal History Coating up to 1,500C and beyond. The final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as increasing efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions.&#91;171&#93;
The Northrop Grumman Antares rocket, with Cygnus resupply spacecraft on board, launches from Pad-0A, Wednesday, April 17, 2019 at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Northrop Grumman's 11th contracted cargo resupply mission for NASA to the International Space Station will deliver about 7,600 pounds of science and research, crew supplies and vehicle hardware to the orbital laboratory and its crew.&#91;172&#93;
Recent and planned activities include:
In response to the Apollo 1 accident, which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In the aftermath of the Shuttle Columbia disaster, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress.&#91;177&#93; By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).&#91;178&#93;
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2014 reaffirmed the importance of ASAP.
Some of NASA's main directives have been the landing of a manned spacecraft on the Moon, the designing and construction of the Space Shuttle, and efforts to construct a large, crewed space station. Typically, the major directives originated from the intersection of scienctific interest and advice, political interests, federal funding concerns, and the public interest, that all together brought varying waves of effort, often heavily swayed by technical developments, funding changes, and world events. For example, in the 1980s, the Reagan administration announced a directive with a major push to build a crewed space station, given the name Space Station Freedom.&#91;179&#93; But, when the Cold War ended, Russia, the United States, and other international partners came together to design and build the International Space Station.
In the 2010s, major shifts in directives include retirement of the Space Shuttle, and the later development of a new crewed heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System. Missions for the new Space Launch System have varied, but overall, NASA's directives are similar to the Space Shuttle program as the primary goal and desire is human spaceflight. Additionally, NASA's Space Exploration Initiative of the 1980s opened new avenues of exploration focused on other galaxies.
For the coming decades, NASA's focus has gradually shifting towards eventual exploration of  Mars.&#91;180&#93; One of the technological options focused on was the  Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM).&#91;180&#93; ARM had largely been defunded in 2017, but the key technologies developed for ARM would be utilized for future exploration, notably on a solar electric propulsion system.&#91;181&#93;&#91;180&#93;
Longer project execution timelines leaves future executive administration officials to execute on a directive, which can lead to directional mismanagement.
Previously, in the early 2000s, NASA worked towards a strategic plan called the Constellation Program, but the program was defunded in the early 2010s.&#91;182&#93;&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93;&#91;185&#93; In the 1990s, the NASA administration adopted an approach to planning coined "Faster, Better, Cheaper".&#91;186&#93;
The NASA Authorization Act of 2017, which included $19.5 ;billion in funding for that fiscal year, directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s.&#91;187&#93;
Though the agency is independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.&#91;188&#93;
In December 2017, on the 45th anniversary of the last crewed mission to the Lunar surface, President Donald Trump approved a directive that includes a lunar mission on the pathway to Mars and beyond.&#91;180&#93;
New NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine addressed this directive in an August 2018 speech where he focused on the sustainability aspects—going to the Moon to stay—that are explicit in the directive, including taking advantage of US commercial space capability that did not exist even five years ago, which have driven down costs and increased access to space.&#91;190&#93;
NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate conducts aeronautics research.
NASA has made use of technologies such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which is a type of Radioisotope thermoelectric generator used on space missions.&#91;191&#93; Shortages of the required plutonium-238 have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennium.&#91;192&#93; An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.&#91;192&#93;
The Earth science research program was created and first funded in the 1980s under the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.&#91;193&#93;&#91;194&#93;
NASA started an annual competition in 2014 named Cubes in Space.&#91;195&#93; It is jointly organized by NASA and the global education company I Doodle Learning, with the objective of teaching school students aged 11–18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a NASA rocket or balloon. On June 21, 2017 the world's smallest satellite, Kalam SAT, built by an Indian team, was launched.&#91;196&#93;
NASA also researches and publishes on climate change.&#91;197&#93; Its statements concur with the global scientific consensus that the global climate is warming.&#91;198&#93; Bob Walker, who has advised US President Donald Trump on space issues, has advocated that NASA should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as NOAA. Former NASA atmospheric scientist J. Marshall Shepherd countered that Earth science study was built into NASA's mission at its creation in the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act.&#91;199&#93; NASA won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Green in the category Web.&#91;200&#93;
NASA contracted a third party to study the probability of using Free Space Optics (FSO) to communicate with Optical (laser) Stations on the Ground (OGS) called laser-com RF networks for satellite communications.&#91;201&#93;
US law requires the International System of Units to be used in all U.S. Government programs, "except where impractical".&#91;202&#93; Today NASA is predominantly working with SI units, but some projects still use a mix of US and SI units.
NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC provides overall guidance and political leadership to the agency's ten field centers, through which all other facilities are administered. The ten field centers are:
Subordinate facilities include the Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Virginia; the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana; the White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Deep Space Network stations in Barstow, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.
NASA's share of the total federal budget peaked at approximately 4.41% in 1966 during the Apollo program, then rapidly declined to approximately 1% in 1975, and stayed around that level through 1998.&#91;188&#93;&#91;207&#93; The percentage then gradually dropped, until leveling off again at around half a percent in 2006 (estimated in 2012 at 0.48% of the federal budget).&#91;208&#93; In a March 2012 hearing of the United States Senate Science Committee, science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson testified that "Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow."&#91;209&#93;&#91;210&#93;
Despite this, public perception of NASA's budget differs significantly: a 1997 poll indicated that most Americans believed that 20% of the federal budget went to NASA.&#91;211&#93;
For Fiscal Year 2015, NASA received an appropriation of US$18.01 billion from Congress—$549 ;million more than requested and approximately $350 ;million more than the 2014 NASA budget passed by Congress.&#91;212&#93;
In Fiscal Year 2016, NASA received $19.3 ;billion.&#91;169&#93;
President Donald Trump signed the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 in March, which set the 2017 budget at around $19.5 ;billion.&#91;169&#93; The budget is also reported as $19.3 ;billion for 2017, with $20.7 ;billion proposed for FY2018.&#91;213&#93;&#91;214&#93;
Examples of some proposed FY2018 budgets:&#91;214&#93;
The exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems, both in Earth's atmosphere and in space, can adversely effect the Earth's environment. Some hypergolic rocket propellants, such as hydrazine, are highly toxic prior to combustion, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene, release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust.&#91;216&#93; However, carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the United States consumed 802,620,000 US gallons (3.0382×109 ;L) of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a single Falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around 25,000 US gallons (95,000 ;L) of kerosene fuel per launch.&#91;217&#93;&#91;218&#93; Even if a Falcon 9 were launched every single day, it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. Additionally, the exhaust from LOx- and LH2- fueled engines, like the SSME, is almost entirely water vapor.&#91;219&#93; NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceled Constellation program in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act in 2011.&#91;220&#93; In contrast, ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion.&#91;221&#93;&#91;222&#93;
On May 8, 2003, Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilities—the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.&#91;223&#93;
An example of NASA's environmental efforts is the NASA Sustainability Base. Additionally, the Exploration Sciences Building was awarded the LEED Gold rating in 2010.&#91;224&#93;

The George Floyd protests&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; are an ongoing series of protests and riots&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93; against police brutality that began as local protests in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota before spreading throughout the United States and then worldwide. The protests began in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020,&#91;8&#93; following the killing of George Floyd, in which Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for over eight minutes after pinning the handcuffed man to the ground during an arrest.&#91;9&#93;
Protests quickly spread across the United States&#91;10&#93; and internationally in support of justice for Floyd, and in opposition to police brutality.&#91;11&#93; At least 12 major cities declared a curfew on the evening of Saturday, May 30,&#91;12&#93; and as of June 2, governors in 24 states and Washington, D.C., had called in the National Guard, with over 17,000 troops activated.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; From the beginning of the protests to the morning of June 2, at least 5,600 people had been arrested.&#91;3&#93;
Frequent cases of police brutality and fatal use of force by law enforcement officers in the United States have long led the civil rights movement and various other activists to protest against the lack of police accountability in incidents involving the use of excessive force. The Watts riots in 1965 were a response to police brutality during the civil rights movement. Confrontations with police during the 1965 riots resulted in the deaths of 34 people, most of whom were African-Americans.&#91;15&#93; The 1992 Los Angeles riots were a response to the acquittal of the police officers responsible for excessive force used on Rodney King. In recent times, these incidents have included the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; the negligence that led to the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore in 2015, the 2016 shooting of Philando Castile&#91;16&#93; and the 2017 shooting of Justine Damond, both in Minnesota; and the 2014 death of Eric Garner in New York City, who, like George Floyd, said, "I can't breathe."&#91;17&#93; In March 2020, the Kentucky shooting of Breonna Taylor by police at her own apartment was widely publicized.&#91;18&#93;
Measures taken against the growing COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of non-essential businesses&#91;19&#93; and implementation of a stay-at-home order,&#91;20&#93; had significant economic and social impact on many Americans as millions lost their jobs and were made more economically vulnerable.&#91;21&#93; Keith Ellison, Attorney General of Minnesota, said he was of the opinion that people "have been cooped up for two months, and so now they're in a different space and a different place. They're restless. Some of them have been unemployed, some of them don't have rent money, and they're angry, they're frustrated."&#91;22&#93;
In April, anti-lockdown protests were held in several U.S. states, including Minnesota, calling governors to lift some restrictions and start "re-opening the country."&#91;23&#93;
On May 25, 2020, at 8:08 ;p.m. CDT,&#91;24&#93; MPD officers responded to a 9-1-1 call regarding a "forgery in progress" on Chicago Avenue South in Powderhorn, Minneapolis. According to police, George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, was in a nearby car and "appeared to be under the influence." A spokesman for the police department said the officers ordered him to exit the vehicle, at which point he "physically resisted." A video taken by a bystander shows Floyd being removed from his vehicle without any resistance.&#91;25&#93;
According to the MPD, officers "were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress. Officers called for an ambulance." However, a Facebook Live livestream recorded by a bystander showed that Derek Chauvin, a 48-year-old white police officer, had pinned Floyd on the ground and was kneeling on his neck.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93; Floyd repeatedly tells Chauvin "Please" and "I can't breathe," while a bystander is heard telling the police officer, "You got him down. Let him breathe."&#91;28&#93; After some time, a bystander points out that Floyd was bleeding from his nose while another bystander tells the police that Floyd is "not even resisting arrest right now," to which the police tell the bystanders that Floyd was "talking, he's fine." A bystander replies saying Floyd "ain't fine." A bystander then protests that the police were preventing Floyd from breathing, urging them to "get him off the ground ... You could have put him in the car by now. He's not resisting arrest or nothing."&#91;27&#93; Floyd then goes silent and motionless. An ambulance arrives and Chauvin does not remove his knee until emergency medical services put Floyd on a stretcher. Not only had Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for about seven minutes (including four minutes after Floyd stopped moving) but another video showed an additional two officers had also knelt on Floyd while another officer watched.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93;
Medics were unable to detect a pulse, and Floyd was pronounced dead at the hospital.&#91;31&#93; An autopsy of Floyd was conducted on May 26, and the next day, the preliminary report by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office was published, stating "no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation." Floyd's underlying health conditions included coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The initial report said that "[t]he combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death."&#91;32&#93; The medical examiner further said Floyd was "high on fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamine at the time of his death."&#91;33&#93; However, on June 1, a private autopsy commissioned by the family of Floyd ruled the death a homicide and found that Floyd had died due to asphyxiation from sustained pressure, which conflicts with the original autopsy report done earlier that week.&#91;34&#93; Shortly after, the official post-mortem declared Floyd's death a homicide.&#91;35&#93;
Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said, "no police academy that we know of teaches a police officer to use their knee, to put it on their neck. That's just not taught because that can impact their breathing and their carotid artery (a crucial vessel that supplies blood to the brain)."&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93; Video footage of the incident generated global attention and raised questions about the appropriate use of force by law enforcement.&#91;37&#93;
Protests began around midday on May 26, the day after Floyd's death,&#91;38&#93; and continued into May 27.&#91;39&#93; A man was fatally shot by a pawn shop owner who thought the man was looting, and the Third Precinct's windows were smashed. Multiple stores were looted, and other buildings were attacked and set ablaze.&#91;40&#93; Protests at the MPD's Third Precinct&#91;41&#93; saw some demonstrators skirmishing with law enforcement officers, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets.&#91;42&#93;&#91;43&#93; A state of emergency was declared in Minneapolis on May 28 by Mayor Jacob Frey, and 500 Minnesota National Guard troops were deployed to the Twin Cities area.&#91;44&#93; By morning, more than 30 businesses in Minneapolis had been damaged by rioters.&#91;40&#93; The Saint Paul Police Department reported that 170 businesses were damaged or looted on Thursday, and dozens of fires started.&#91;45&#93; There was no police, fire, or EMS presence in the area where the riots occurred from around 10:00 ;p.m. CDT on May 28 into the early hours of May 29.&#91;46&#93; MPD in the Third Precinct building attempted to hold off the protesters with tear gas, but at around 11:00 ;p.m. on May 28, protesters overran the building and set it ablaze after it was evacuated.&#91;47&#93; Later that morning at 5:11 ;am CDT, CNN reporter Omar Jiménez, who is of African-American and Colombian descent,&#91;48&#93; and camera crew were arrested by Minnesota State Patrol officers as Jiménez reported live on television.&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93;
For several days following Floyd's death, hundreds of protesters gathered at the driveway of Chauvin's house, which prompted police response.&#91;51&#93;
On May 29, Walz imposed a curfew for the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul that would run from 8:00 ;p.m. to 6:00 ;a.m. on Friday, May 29 and Saturday, May 30.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93; Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also issued a similar curfew.&#91;54&#93; Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on May 29.&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93; Despite the announcement of the charges and the new curfew, riots broke out again on Friday night and well into early Saturday morning.&#91;57&#93; Law enforcement presence was reportedly "undetectable", as violence in Minneapolis quickly expanded until just before midnight, when police officers, state troopers, and members of the National Guard began confronting rioters with tear gas and mass force.&#91;57&#93;
As of May 30, 2,500 officers were deployed and 50 people have been arrested in relation to the protests. President Donald Trump assured Walz of military support if needed.&#91;58&#93;&#91;59&#93; Major General Jon Jensen of the Minnesota National Guard said that by May 31, over 1,700 National Guard soldiers could be deployed. This would be the largest national deployment in the state's history.&#91;60&#93; Jensen confirmed that 2,500 guards would be deployed by noon.&#91;61&#93; The 4,100 troops of the Minnesota National Guard was scheduled to increase to 10,800 on May 31.&#91;62&#93;

As of June 2, governors in 24 states and Washington, D.C. had called in the National Guard to respond to the protests. Over 17,000 troops have been activated.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; During an address on Monday, June 1, Trump threatened to deploy the U.S. military in response to the unrest: "If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them".&#91;72&#93; This would require invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807,&#91;72&#93; which was last invoked to quell the 1992 Los Angeles riots on May 1, 1992 by Executive Order 12804. Also on June 1, Arkansas senator Tom Cotton pushed for the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division to be deployed to quell the unrest, calling protestors "Antifa terrorists".&#91;73&#93;

There have been numerous reports and videos of aggressive police actions using physical force as well as "batons, tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters, bystanders and journalists, often without warning or seemingly unprovoked."&#91;91&#93; These incidents have provoked "growing concern that aggressive law enforcement tactics intended to impose order were instead inflaming tensions."&#91;91&#93; Police responded that such tactics are necessary to prevent vandalism and arson, and that police officers themselves have been assaulted with thrown rocks and water bottles.&#91;91&#93; In response to the violence, Amnesty International issued a press release calling for the police to end excessive militarized responses to the protests.&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93;
Two New York City Police Department (NYPD) vehicles were recorded ramming into protesters surrounding and throwing objects at the vehicles;&#91;94&#93; New York City mayor Bill de Blasio defended the officers' actions and an investigation into the event was initiated.&#91;95&#93; Another NYPD police officer was recorded throwing down a female protester with both hands while calling her a "stupid fucking bitch." The protester was hospitalized after the assault and claims to have suffered a seizure.&#91;96&#93; An NYPD officer approached a protester, ripped off the protester's mask, and pepper-sprayed the protester in the face.&#91;97&#93; The NYPD has said it is investigating the incident.&#91;97&#93; An officer in Salt Lake City pushed an unarmed elderly man walking with a cane  to the ground.&#91;98&#93;&#91;99&#93;

In Seattle, an officer placed his knee on the back of the neck of a looting suspect; after onlookers shouted for him to remove his knee from the man's neck his partner pulled it off.&#91;91&#93;  The Seattle Office of Police Accountability received about 12,000 individual complaints regarding the police department's conduct during that weekend, including complaints about "[p]epper spraying a young girl", "[p]unching a person on the ground who was being arrested", "[p]lacing a knee on the neck area of two people who had been arrested", "[f]ailing to record law enforcement activity on body-worn video", and "[breaking] windows of a Target store".&#91;106&#93;

According to Fox Business, the man appeared to defend a store and was reportedly armed with a machete and has skirmished with rioters, who were throwing rocks at him.&#91;128&#93; The man was injured, but was able to sit up and was treated at the scene before being taken away in an ambulance, where he was considered to be in a stable condition.&#91;129&#93; President Donald Trump called the act of violence "terrible" and demanded arrests and "long term jail sentences" for protesters.&#91;129&#93; According to protesters, they acted in self-defense, and the video was edited to give "false impression" about protests.&#91;130&#93;
According to BlackSportsOnline.com, Charles Shoultz later claimed to be the man who was attacked by the crowd of protesters, blaming himself for instigating fight, explaining that he was merely "trying to protect the bar he likes to drink at".&#91;131&#93;&#91;132&#93; Dallas Police said that the incident is part of an ongoing investigation.
In St. Louis around 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 2, retired police Captain David Dorn, 77, was murdered by a looter outside a pawn shop.&#91;133&#93;&#91;134&#93;&#91;135&#93;

Journalists at several protests were injured and arrested by police while trying to cover the story, being shot by rubber bullets, or sprayed by tear gas.&#91;141&#93;&#91;142&#93; As of March 31, Bellingcat has identified and documented at least 50 separate incidents where journalists were attacked by law enforcement officials during the protests.&#91;143&#93; According to Bellingcat, "law enforcement across multiple cities, but especially in Minneapolis, are knowingly and deliberately targeting journalists with less lethal munitions, arrests and other forms of violence."&#91;143&#93;
Omar Jiménez, a black Latino CNN reporter, and his filming crew were arrested while giving a live television report on May 29 in Minneapolis by the Minnesota State Patrol, and then released about an hour later.&#91;144&#93; After the incident took place, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said that he deeply apologizes for what happened and would work to have the crew released, calling the event "unacceptable" and adding that there was "absolutely no reason something like this should happen."&#91;144&#93;&#91;145&#93;
CNN called the arrests a "clear violation of their First Amendment rights" in a tweet posted the same day.&#91;145&#93; After the incident the Minnesota State Patrol tweeted that "In the course of clearing the streets and restoring order at Lake Street and Snelling Avenue, four people were arrested by State Patrol troopers, including three members of a CNN crew. The three were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media," however the CNN crew had already informed the troopers that they were members of the media before and during the arrest and carried the relevant paperwork and identification with them.&#91;146&#93;&#91;147&#93; The Minneapolis Police Department falsely stated both while performing the arrest and via Twitter that his crew had not adequately responded when asked what they were doing.&#91;148&#93;
Linda Tirado, a freelance photo journalist, was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet or a pellet by the police in Minneapolis, and following surgery has been left permanently blind in that eye.&#91;149&#93;&#91;150&#93;

The station manager issued a statement strongly condemning the incident, saying there was "no justification for police to wantonly open fire."&#91;151&#93;
On the evening of May 28, officers fired pepper bullets at several employees of The Denver Post who were reporting on protests in Denver, Colorado. A photographer was struck twice by pepper bullets, sustaining injuries on his arm. The photographer believed it was not accidental, saying, "If it was one shot, I can say it was an accident. I'm very sure it was the same guy twice. I'm very sure he pointed at me." Another journalist said an officer shot at least one pepper bullet at her feet.&#91;152&#93;

There have been allegations of foreign influence stoking the unrest online, with the role of outside powers being additive rather than decisive as of May 31.&#91;168&#93; The CEO of Graphika, which helped the U.S. Senate form its report on Russian social media influence during the 2016 elections, noted "very active engagement" from account clusters from Russia, Iran, and China, and as of May 31 noted that his team was launching an investigation on the matter of possible foreign influence.&#91;168&#93;
Republican Senator Marco Rubio, the current acting Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, asserted "very heavy" social media activity linked to "at least three foreign adversaries", noting that while they "didn't create these divisions", they are "actively stoking and promoting violence".&#91;169&#93; National security advisor Robert C. O'Brien said that there may be Russian activists who are exploiting the situation, but also, in reference to Chinese officials on social media, that "it's coming straight from the government."&#91;170&#93; Former national security advisor Susan Rice stated that the violence that was emerging was "right out of the Russian playbook", drawing angry responses from Russian officials with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova saying that Rice is trying to blame Russia again for the United States' own domestic problems instead of facing her own people.&#91;171&#93; Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied there being any interactions between President of Russia Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump regarding the protests.&#91;172&#93;
There have been accusations of various extremist groups using the cover of the protests to foment general unrest in the United States. According to CNN, "although interference in this way may be happening, federal and local officials have yet to provide evidence to the public."&#91;173&#93;
On May 31, Trump announced that he planned to designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist group. Various government and non-government officials have stated that designating domestic terrorist groups is prohibited by the First Amendment.&#91;181&#93;
On May 29, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz noted then-unconfirmed reports of white supremacists as well as drug cartels taking advantage of the protests.&#91;182&#93; Although reports that all or most of the individuals arrested were not from Minnesota turned out to be false, the presence of white supremacist groups aiming to exploit the protests to incite violence was confirmed the following day by Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington.&#91;183&#93;
On May 30, Minnesota officials including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter stated they believed that white nationalists were using the protests as cover for inciting violence,&#91;184&#93; and that Minnesota officials were monitoring the ongoing far-right online effort to incite violence.&#91;185&#93; On the other hand, Howard Graves, an analyst at the SPLC stated on May 31 that he did not see clear evidence of "white supremacists or militiamen" heading out to "burn and loot".&#91;186&#93; The University of St. Thomas' Lisa Waldner, an analyst of the American white supremacist and anarchist movements, has noted that the goal of many of the individuals involved in the destruction of Minneapolis was to create chaos so as to pursue their own agendas.&#91;187&#93; White nationalist Facebook groups reportedly began urging members to "get their loot on".&#91;184&#93; In at least 20 cities across the country as of May 31, members of hate groups and far-right organizations filmed themselves at the demonstrations.&#91;186&#93;
Vice and New York University's Reiss Center&#91;185&#93; reported that far-right accelerationists, who aim to exacerbate tensions and speed up the supposed coming of a "civil war", have urged followers online to use the protests as an occasion to carry out violence; an eco-fascist Telegram channel with almost 2500 subscribers posted on the 28th that "a riot would be the perfect place to commit a murder".&#91;188&#93; Analysis by Vice and the New York Times&#91;186&#93; also noted the proliferation of chatter on 4chan hailing the violence as the beginning of a "race war". Such tactics match a long running history of accelerationists exploiting moments of political and/or civil unrest&#91;188&#93; to, in the words of historian Stuart Wexler, "produce racial polarization and eventual retaliation" which would then swell the ranks of whites supporting white supremacist violence, ultimately leading to a race war that they hope will "purify" America through ethnic cleansing.&#91;189&#93; Analogous tactics were used by their ideological forebears in the 1960s,&#91;189&#93; and accelerationist ideas are proliferated on web forums and have inspired various white supremacist acts of violence, being featured also in the manifesto of the perpetrator of the Christchurch massacre.&#91;185&#93;&#91;190&#93;
The presence of Boogaloo Bois, an armed anti-government far-right extremist movement that seeks a Second American Civil War, noticeable for their Hawaiian shirts, have also been reported at the protests.&#91;188&#93; Administrators of the Facebook page Big Igloo Bois, a splinter of the Boogaloo movement, called for members to attend the protests with one administrator stating, "come in peace, prepare for there to be violence."&#91;191&#93; While some of the Boogaloo Bois have espoused white supremacist views, other groups, such as the Big Igloo Bois, have aimed to make common cause with the Black Lives Matter movement due to their shared mistrust of the police.&#91;192&#93;&#91;185&#93;
According to a Twitter spokesperson, an account pretending to belong to a national “antifa” organization and pushing violent rhetoric related to ongoing protests has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa, which also calls itself the American Identity Movement.&#91;193&#93;
Many individuals of the general population and celebrities used social media to document the protests, spread information, promote donation sites, and post memorials to George Floyd. Cardi B used her social media to comment on the police brutality and looting during the protests stating; "Police brutality been going on even way before I was born, but it has been more visual ever since social media" and "How many peaceful protests have we seen? How many trending hashtags have we seen? People are tired. Now this [looting] is what people have to resort to."&#91;194&#93;&#91;relevant?&#32; &#8211; discuss&#93;
The hashtag #WalkWithUs was used to highlight law enforcement individuals who joined protesters in protesting against police brutality, such as in Santa Cruz, California, and Flint, Michigan.&#91;195&#93; Childish Gambino's song "This is America" was used heavily by protesters sharing footage of protests and police action on TikTok.&#91;196&#93; Others used personal Twitter pages to post video documentation of the protests to highlight police and protestors actions, and points of the protests they felt would not be reported.&#91;197&#93; One example was a viral photo that appears to show white women protestors standing with their arms locked between Louisville Metro Police Officers and black protestors, with the caption describing the image and "This is love. This is what you do with your privilege."&#91;198&#93;
During this time, multiple videos of the looting, protests and riots were shared by journalists and protestors with many videos going viral. One such was footage of a destroyed and smoky Target store interior that the poster claimed was in Minneapolis and damaged during the protests.&#91;199&#93;
Following Floyd's death on May 25, 2020, a 15-year old started a Change.org petition&#91;200&#93; labelled "Justice for George Floyd" demanding that all four police officers involved should be charged. The petition has gained over 10 ;million signatures, making it the largest petition in the site's history.&#91;201&#93; Celebrities like Beyoncé have shown their support by promoting this petition on Instagram.&#91;202&#93; Director Spike Lee posted a short film on his social media to support the protests and highlighted the deaths Floyd, Eric Garner and fictional character Radio Raheem from his film Do the Right Thing. The short uses footage of the deaths of all three men and opens with the words "Will history stop repeating itself?"&#91;203&#93;
Misinformation has been spread across social media since hours prior to the beginning of the first protests. Internet users and celebrities spread images of men wearing MAGA hats that were falsely identified as Chauvin.&#91;204&#93; Social media users claimed a man videoed breaking the windows of an AutoZone in Minneapolis on May 27 was an undercover Saint Paul Police officer (who was identified by his ex-wife); the Saint Paul Police Department denied these claims through a statement on Twitter.&#91;205&#93;&#91;206&#93; The person has yet to be officially identified. Others spread images of damage from other protests or incidents, falsely attributing the damage to the George Floyd protests.&#91;204&#93;
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz speculated that there was "an organized attempt to destabilize civil society," initially stating that as many as 80% of the individuals had possibly come from outside the state,&#91;207&#93; and the mayor of St. Paul, Melvin Carter, said that everyone arrested in St. Paul on May 29 was from out of state.&#91;208&#93; However, this was shown to be incorrect, as records proved that the majority of those arrested were in-state.&#91;209&#93; At a press conference later the same day, Carter explained that he had "shared... arrest data received in [his] morning police briefing which [he] later learned to be inaccurate."&#91;210&#93;
Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts associated with spreading a false claim about a communications blackout during protests in Washington DC, or a claim that authorities had somehow blocked protesters from communicating on their smartphones.&#91;211&#93; Also, some accounts shared a photo of a major fire burning near the Washington Monument, which was actually an image from a television show.&#91;212&#93;&#91;213&#93;
On May 27, 2020, President Donald Trump tweeted "At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd...."&#91;215&#93;
On May 29, Trump responded to the riots by threatening that either "the very weak Radical Left Mayor Jacob Frey get his act together and bring the City under control" or he will send in the National Guard, adding that "Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."&#91;216&#93;&#91;217&#93;&#91;218&#93;&#91;219&#93; The tweet was interpreted as quoting former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley, who said "when the looting starts, the shooting starts" in December 1967, as Miami saw escalating tensions and racial protests aimed at the 1968 Republican National Convention.&#91;58&#93;&#91;220&#93; Trump's use of the quote was seen by Twitter as an incitement of violence; Twitter placed the tweet behind a public interest notice for breaching its terms of service in regards to incitement of violence.&#91;221&#93; The next day, Trump commented on his original tweet, saying, "Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means...."&#91;222&#93;
In a May 31 series of tweets, Trump blamed the press for the protests and said that journalists are "truly bad people with a sick agenda".&#91;140&#93; In a call with governors, Trump said they have been "weak" and insisted that they "have to dominate ... You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again".&#91;223&#93; On June 1 he spoke from the Rose Garden, where he proclaimed "I am your president of law and order" and said he was "dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers" to deal with rioting in Washington, D.C.&#91;224&#93; He then walked to the historic St. John’s Episcopal Church, whose basement had been damaged by fire, and posed for pictures in front of it holding up a Bible. To clear the route so that he could walk there, police and national guardsmen had used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square.&#91;225&#93;
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) argued that extremists from the far-left and the far-right wanted to take aim at civil society and could potentially start a 2nd Civil War.&#91;226&#93;&#91;227&#93;
On May 30, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that the riots have exposed the "inequality and discrimination in the criminal justice system" and that "When you have one episode, two episodes maybe you can look at them as individual episodes. But when you have 10 episodes, 15 episodes, you are blind or in denial if you are still treating each one like a unique situation,"&#91;228&#93;
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms called for protesters to express their anger through "non-violent" means. She decried the riots as illegitimate and accused them of harming Atlanta rather than helping.&#91;229&#93;
Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, while sympathizing with the anger of protesters, asked for citizens to stop the violence and have a "Respectful, peaceful dialogue."&#91;230&#93;
The entertainment industry has been supportive of protesters, exhibited by a number of prominent figures supporting the protests and adjacent Black Lives Matter causes. Much of the music industry called for a "blackout" on June 2.&#91;231&#93;&#91;232&#93;
Television networks owned by ViacomCBS, including BET, CBS Sports Network, CMT, Comedy Central, Logo TV, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, the Smithsonian Channel, TV Land, and VH1 suspended regular programming for 8 minutes and 46 seconds on June 1 at 5pm as a tribute to Floyd. The networks aired a video with the caption "I can't breathe" accompanied with breathing sounds, while Nickelodeon aired a separate scrolling video containing language from the Declaration of Kids' Rights, which the network first created on June 7, 1990.&#91;233&#93;
On the morning of May 29, Target temporarily closed 24 of its locations in the Twin Cities area, and reopened all but six the same day.&#91;234&#93;&#91;235&#93; Target later announced that they would be closing 73 of their Minnesota stores until further notice and made a commitment to rebuilding the store on Lake Street.&#91;236&#93; On May 31, Target closed 49 stores in California and 12 stores in New York.&#91;237&#93;
On May 31, Walmart temporarily closed several hundred of its stores as a precaution. Amazon also announced it would redirect some delivery routes and scale back others as a result of the widespread unrest.&#91;238&#93;
Surgeon General Jerome Adams said, in relation to the protests, that the U.S. "must acknowledge &amp; address the impact of racism on health"&#91;1&#93; and, via Twitter, that,
Health experts warned that the mass protests likely facilitate an accelerated spread of COVID-19.&#91;240&#93;&#91;241&#93;&#91;242&#93;&#91;243&#93;&#91;244&#93;&#91;245&#93; Minnesota Governor Tim Walz expressed worries over a spike in COVID-19 cases.&#91;246&#93; New York Governor Andrew Cuomo shared similar worries describing the protests as "inherently dangerous in the context of this pandemic".&#91;242&#93; He also stated that people have the right to protest but that they don't have the "right to infect other people", or the "right to act in a way that's going to jeopardize public health."&#91;242&#93; Mayor of Washington, D.C. Muriel Bowser stated that "We've been working hard to not have mass gatherings. As a nation, we have to be concerned about rebound."&#91;241&#93; Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms stated that "I am extremely concerned when we're seeing mass gatherings. We know what's happening in our community with this virus,"&#91;242&#93; She also said "If you were out protesting last night, you probably need to go get a Covid test this week."&#91;247&#93; Maryland Governor Larry Hogan shared a similar sentiment, saying that "There's no questions that when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity when we've got this virus all over the streets is not healthy".&#91;242&#93;
Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney requested that citizens protest according to social distancing guidelines.&#91;248&#93; New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asked for citizens to protest wearing masks to prevent spread of the disease.&#91;242&#93; Minnesota's governor stated that "too many" protesters weren't applying physical person-to-person distances or wearing masks.&#91;245&#93; Some police officers also weren't adhering to protective rules and norms such as wearing masks.&#91;245&#93; Floyd's family encouraged those attending the official public memorial to do so wearing masks and gloves.&#91;249&#93; Experts have mixed views of the potential efficacy of properly used, non-N95 masks and note that using a face mask does not warrant stopping other protective practices such as keeping sufficient physical distance from others.&#91;250&#93; Ashish Jha, the director of the global health institute at Harvard's TH Chan School of public believes that masks are a critical part of protesting safely and in accordance to COVID-19 guidelines.&#91;247&#93; Theodore Long, a doctor affiliated with New York's contact tracing strategy, echoed Jha's point as well as advocating for attendants to "practice proper hand hygiene and to the extent possible, socially distance".&#91;247&#93;
Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under President Donald Trump said that "There's going to be a lot of issues coming out of what's happened in the last week, but one of them is going to be that chains of transmission will have become lit from these gatherings".&#91;242&#93; Megan Ranney, an emergency room physician and researcher at Brown University called for people to examine the racial disparities of the COVID-19 spread and their relation to the protests.&#91;242&#93;
Many nations around the world have watched the unrest in the United States in horror and are alarmed by the chaos and violence.&#91;251&#93;

On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a black man, was killed in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During an arrest, Derek Chauvin, a white American police officer, kept his knee on the side of Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down. During the last three minutes, Floyd was motionless.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; Officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng, and Thomas K. Lane participated in Floyd's arrest, with Kueng holding Floyd's back, Lane holding his legs, and Thao looking on and forcibly preventing intervention by an onlooker.&#91;7&#93;:6:24&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;
Floyd was arrested because he was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a market.&#91;10&#93; Police said Floyd physically resisted arrest.&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93; Some media organizations commented that a security camera from a nearby business did not show Floyd resisting.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; The criminal complaint filed later said that, based on body camera footage, Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe while standing outside the police car, resisted getting in the car and intentionally fell down;&#91;1&#93;&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; then, after Chauvin placed his knee, Floyd said "I can't breathe" multiple times and repeatedly said, "Mama" and "please".&#91;1&#93; Several bystanders took videos, all of which were widely circulated and broadcast.&#91;19&#93; While knee-to-neck restraints are allowed in Minnesota under certain circumstances, Chauvin's usage of the technique has been widely criticized by law enforcement experts as excessive.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93; At two points, Lane asked to "roll him on his side".&#91;1&#93; All four officers involved in the arrest were fired the next day.&#91;23&#93;
The two autopsies conducted of Floyd concluded that he died by homicide.&#91;24&#93; The Hennepin County medical examiner's autopsy found that Floyd died from cardiac arrest while being restrained by officers who had employed "neck compression", also noting "arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; and recent methamphetamine use".&#91;24&#93; An independent autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family found that the "evidence is consistent with mechanical asphyxia as the cause" of death, with neck compression restricting blood flow to the brain, and back compression restricting breathing.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;
The FBI is conducting a federal civil rights investigation at the request of the Minneapolis Police Department. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is also investigating.&#91;27&#93; On May 29, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for Floyd's death, with Hennepin County attorney Michael O. Freeman saying he anticipated that charges would be brought against the other three officers.&#91;18&#93;&#91;28&#93;
After Floyd's death, demonstrations and protests against racism and police brutality were held across the US and the world, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the movement and gathering restrictions put in place by governments to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.&#91;29&#93; Protests in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area were initially peaceful on May 26. Later that day, the protests became violent as a police precinct and two stores were set on fire, and many stores were looted and damaged.&#91;30&#93; Some demonstrators skirmished with police, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets.&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93; Additional protests developed in over 400 cities throughout all 50 states in the United States as well as internationally. Floyd's death has been compared to the 2014 death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who repeated "I can't breathe" eleven times while being placed in a chokehold by a police officer in Staten Island, New York.&#91;2&#93;&#91;33&#93;
On the evening of Monday, May 25, 2020, Floyd purchased a pack of cigarettes at Cup Foods, a store at the intersection of East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis. A store employee believed Floyd had paid with a counterfeit $20 bill.&#91;7&#93;&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;
Just before 8:00 ;p.m. CDT, two Cup Food employees left the store and crossed the street to an SUV parked in front of a restaurant. Floyd was in the driver's seat and there were two others in the vehicle.&#91;7&#93;:1:25&#91;60&#93;:1:33&#91;61&#93; The employees demanded that Floyd return the cigarettes, and he refused.&#91;60&#93;:1:43&#91;61&#93; The interaction was filmed by the restaurant's security camera.&#91;7&#93;:0:49&#91;60&#93;:1:24&#91;62&#93;&#91;a&#93; At 8:01 ;p.m., a store employee called 9-1-1 to report that Floyd had passed "fake bills" and was "awfully drunk" and "not in control of himself".&#91;7&#93;:1:33&#91;60&#93;:1:51&#91;61&#93;
At 8:08 ;p.m. Lane and Kueng briefly entered Cup Foods,&#91;7&#93;:1:41&#91;60&#93;:2:00&#91;61&#93; then crossed the street to Floyd's SUV.&#91;7&#93;:1:49 Lane drew his gun and ordered Floyd to put his hands on the steering wheel; Floyd complied and Lane holstered his weapon.&#91;60&#93;:2:10&#91;61&#93; Someone parked behind Floyd's SUV began taking video at 8:10 ;p.m.&#91;7&#93;:1:56&#91;60&#93;:2:28 Following a brief struggle, Lane pulled Floyd from the SUV, handcuffed him, and told him he was being arrested.&#91;7&#93;:2:10&#91;60&#93;:2:20&#91;61&#93;
At 8:12 ;p.m., Kueng sat Floyd on the sidewalk against the wall in front of the restaurant.&#91;7&#93;:2:22&#91;60&#93;:2:33 At 8:13 ;p.m., an officer brought Floyd to his feet and walked him across the street to the sidewalk in front of Cup Food;&#91;7&#93;:2:30 a police car was parked at the curb. Around 8:14 ;p.m., Floyd fell to the ground next to police car; officers picked him up and placed him against the door of their car.&#91;7&#93;:2:42&#91;60&#93;:3:00 According to local prosecutors, Floyd told the officers he was claustrophobic&#91;60&#93;:3:10&#91;61&#93; and couldn't breathe.&#91;60&#93;:3:23 A Minneapolis Park Police officer arrived and guarded Floyd's vehicle (across the street by the restaurant) and the two people who had been in it with Floyd.&#91;7&#93;:2:53&#91;63&#93;
At 8:17 ;p.m., a third police cruiser arrived, with MPD officers Derek Michael Chauvin and Tou Thao. They walked over to assist Lane and Kueng.&#91;7&#93;:3:32&#91;60&#93;:3:27&#91;61&#93; Around 8:18 ;p.m., security footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd for at least a minute in the driver's side backseat while Thao watches.&#91;7&#93;:3:54&#91;60&#93;:3:49 A criminal complaint filed against Chauvin alleges Floyd refused to enter the car, even after officers moved him from the driver's side to the passenger side.&#91;7&#93;:4:00&#91;60&#93;:3:15 At 8:19 ;p.m., standing on the passenger's side of the vehicle, Chauvin pulled Floyd through the backseat, from the driver's side to the passenger's side, and out of the car, causing Floyd to fall onto the ground, where, still handcuffed, he lay on the pavement.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;:3:56 Floyd stopped moving around 8:20 ;p.m.&#91;7&#93;:4:10
Multiple witnesses began to film the encounter; their videos were circulated widely on the internet.&#91;60&#93;:4:06&#91;61&#93; At 8:20 ;p.m., a bystander at the Speedway LLC gas station across the intersection began recording video on their phone showing Floyd face down on the pavement with Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, Kueng applying pressure to Floyd's torso, and Lane applying pressure to Floyd's legs, while Thao stood nearby.&#91;7&#93;:4:13&#91;60&#93;:4:11&#91;61&#93; Floyd can be heard repeatedly saying "I can't breathe", "please, please, please", and "please, man", and calling for his mother.&#91;7&#93;:4:44&#91;60&#93;:4:28&#91;61&#93; The bystander stopped filming when one of the officers told him to walk away.&#91;60&#93;:4:35
Also at 8:20 ;p.m., a second person, standing near the entrance of Cup Foods, began recording the incident.&#91;7&#93;:4:26&#91;60&#93;:5:08&#91;2&#93; According to The New York Times, these two videos show Floyd telling officers he can't breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes.&#91;60&#93;:5:46 At one point a bystander said, "You got him down. Let him breathe."&#91;64&#93; After Floyd said, "I'm about to die", Chauvin told him to "relax".&#91;65&#93; The police ask Floyd, "What do you want?" Floyd answers, "I can't breathe."&#91;66&#93; Floyd states: "Please, the knee in my neck, I can't breathe."&#91;65&#93; 
At 8:27 ;p.m., a Hennepin County ambulance arrived.&#91;7&#93;:5:56&#91;60&#93;:7:11 Shortly thereafter, a young relative of the owner of Cup Foods attempted to intervene, but was pushed back by Thao.&#91;7&#93;:6:03 The emergency medical technicians (EMTs) checked Floyd's pulse.&#91;60&#93;:7:17 Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for almost a minute after the EMTs arrived, despite Floyd appearing unresponsive.&#91;60&#93;:7:21
Around 8:28 ;p.m., after being told to do so by EMTs, Chauvin lifted his knee off of Floyd's neck, having kept it there for eight minutes and forty-six seconds, according to the criminal complaint against Chauvin.&#91;7&#93;:6:27&#91;60&#93;:7:28&#91;61&#93; Around 8:29 ;p.m., a motionless Floyd was placed on a stretcher and loaded into the ambulance, which left the scene and headed to Hennepin County Medical Center, calling the Minneapolis Fire Department for additional medical assistance en route.&#91;7&#93;:6:35&#91;60&#93;:7:43&#91;61&#93;
At 8:32 ;p.m., the fire department arrived at the scene.&#91;7&#93;:6:56&#91;60&#93;:7:56 According to the fire department's report, the police officers gave no clear information regarding Floyd's condition or whereabouts, which delayed their ability to assist the ambulance.&#91;60&#93;:7:56&#91;71&#93; Meanwhile, the ambulance carrying Floyd again called for assistance from the fire department, asking them to meet at the corner of 36th Street and Park Avenue, and reporting that Floyd was going into cardiac arrest. Five minutes later, the fire department reached the ambulance.&#91;60&#93;:8:10 Two fire department medics who boarded the ambulance described Floyd in their report as unresponsive and pulseless.&#91;7&#93;:6:56
Floyd was pronounced dead at 9:25 ;p.m. at the Hennepin County Medical Center emergency room, according to the incident report.&#91;7&#93;:7:12&#91;60&#93;:8:28&#91;61&#93;&#91;72&#93;
Police initially claimed that Floyd had resisted arrest,&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93; though another video showed that "Officer [Chauvin] struggles to get Floyd out of the car."&#91;73&#93; but the restaurant surveillance video "shows officers calmly detaining him".&#91;74&#93; The surveillance video "does not support police claims that George Floyd resisted arrest", wrote CNN.&#91;75&#93;
Vice describes that Floyd "doesn't appear to be resisting ;– just standing next to his car."&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93; The Independent wrote, "The video shows two policemen pulling Mr. ;Floyd from his car without any apparent resistance."&#91;78&#93;
A video of the incident from a different angle showed "three officers have Floyd pinned on the ground, while another stands over him", reported CBS Evening News.&#91;79&#93; The Wall Street Journal described it as "three officers are seen sitting on" Floyd.&#91;80&#93;
The Minneapolis Park Police Department released heavily-redacted footage from from the body camera worn by one of their officers, who was 118 feet away from the scene of Floyd's death.&#91;81&#93; One officer reassures the two passengers from Floyd's car that an ambulance was coming, and tells them to "stay put".&#91;82&#93;
As of May 31, the footage from Lane and Kueng's body cameras have not been released.&#91;83&#93; but has been turned over to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.&#91;84&#93;
On May 26, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced that the four officers were placed on leave.&#91;85&#93; Later in the day they were fired.&#91;23&#93;
On May 27, false claims about Chauvin began to circulate on social media. Particularly prominent were claims that a photograph shows Chauvin wearing a "Make Whites Great Again" hat and that Chauvin appeared onstage with President Donald Trump at a rally; both claims were false.&#91;86&#93;&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93;
Hennepin County attorney Mike Freeman said he also anticipated charges for the three other officers.&#91;95&#93;
On May 26, 2020, an autopsy was performed on Floyd by the Hennepin County medical examiner.&#91;26&#93;
On May 29, the criminal complaint against Chauvin was publicly released by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.&#91;98&#93; With the full report of the Hennepin County medical examiner yet to be released at the time, the criminal complaint instead cited "preliminary findings" by the Hennepin County medical examiner.&#91;99&#93; The complaint cited preliminary results that the autopsy "revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation", but found that Floyd suffered from coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease.&#91;26&#93;&#91;98&#93; The complaint cited the autopsy's speculation that the "combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death."&#91;26&#93;&#91;98&#93;
On June 1, the Hennepin County medical examiner issued a press release of the autopsy's "final findings".&#91;100&#93; It classified Floyd's death as a homicide, caused by "a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained" by law enforcement officers, who had subjected Floyd to "subdual" and "neck compression".&#91;101&#93;&#91;102&#93; It lastly noted other "significant conditions": arteriosclerotic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication, and recent methamphetamine use.&#91;26&#93;&#91;101&#93;
On May 29, Dr. Michael Baden said that he had been retained by Floyd's family to carry out a private autopsy on Floyd. Baden is a pathologist and a former New York City chief medical examiner who had also conducted a second autopsy on Eric Garner.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93; On May 30, Floyd's family's legal team confirmed that they had hired Baden and also Dr. Allecia Wilson to conduct an autopsy.&#91;105&#93; Wilson is the director of autopsy and forensic services at the University of Michigan Medical School.&#91;106&#93;
On May 31, a private autopsy commissioned by Floyd's family was conducted.&#91;107&#93; On June 1, Wilson said the finding of the private autopsy that the "evidence is consistent with mechanical asphyxia as the cause" of Floyd's death, and that the death was a homicide.&#91;25&#93;&#91;106&#93; Baden said that Floyd died from "asphyxia due to compression of the neck", which affects the "blood flow and oxygen going into the brain", and also from "compression of the back, which interferes with breathing".&#91;26&#93; Baden said that Floyd "had no underlying medical problem that caused or contributed to his death", and he also said it was "not true" that being able to talk shows that someone could breathe properly.&#91;108&#93;
In the wake of community outrage in Minneapolis, the place where Floyd died in front of the store and the surrounding area became a makeshift memorial throughout May 26, with many placards paying tribute to him and referencing the Black Lives Matter movement.&#91;110&#93; As the day progressed, more people showed up to demonstrate against Floyd's death. The crowd, estimated to be in the hundreds of people,&#91;111&#93;&#91;112&#93;&#91;113&#93;&#91;114&#93; then marched to the 3rd Precinct of the Minneapolis Police.&#91;113&#93; Participants used posters and slogans with phrases such as "Justice for George", "I Can't Breathe", and "Black Lives Matter".&#91;115&#93;
Although the protests on the first day were initially peaceful, a smaller group of protesters vandalized the 3rd Precinct, breaking windows, &#91;116&#93; and also vandalized police cars&#91;citation needed&#93;. However some video evidence has pointed out that Minneapolis police may have exacerbated the riots by sending plain clothes police officers to vandalize stores, something the Minneapolis police has denied. &#91;117&#93;&#91;118&#93;&#91;119&#93; This led to police officers in riot gear using tear gas and flash grenades on the protesters, while some protesters threw rocks and other objects at the police.&#91;120&#93; The police also used rubber bullets and smoke bombs against the protesters.&#91;121&#93; The media has highlighted the apparent differences in aggression between the police response to black protesters in these protests versus the more measured response to the 2020 United States anti-lockdown protests featuring gun-wielding white protesters.&#91;121&#93;&#91;122&#93; This sentiment also spread on social media.&#91;123&#93;
Those protests later became violent, which continued for days.&#91;30&#93;&#91;124&#93;&#91;125&#93; As of June 2, the Star Tribune estimated 308 businesses across the Twin Cities region had been vandalized or entirely destroyed, including 41 in Minneapolis and 3 in St. Paul "destroyed by fire."&#91;126&#93;
Following protests, a nighttime curfew in Minneapolis–Saint Paul and Dakota County was established on May 29. 500 Minnesota National Guard soldiers were later dispatched to the area to enforce the curfew,&#91;127&#93; but to little effect, with about 1,000 protesters being able to march peacefully on Interstate 35 well into curfew.&#91;128&#93;
The family of Floyd announced on June 2, a public memorial to be held on June 8 at The Fountain of Praise Church in Houston. A private service will be held at an undisclosed location on June 9. According to the statement released by the family, former professional boxer Floyd Mayweather will pay for the services.&#91;129&#93; The same day another public memorial service, this time held at North Central University on June 4, was announced. Reverend Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy.&#91;130&#93; The retired American boxer Floyd Mayweather has offered to cover the costs of George Floyd's Funeral services, the Family of George Floyd has accepted the offer.&#91;131&#93;
Protests against police brutality and the death of George Floyd sprang up in more than 100 cities,&#91;132&#93; including New York City;&#91;133&#93; Los Angeles;&#91;134&#93; Toronto;&#91;135&#93; Mashhad;&#91;136&#93; Milan;&#91;137&#93; Columbus, Ohio;&#91;138&#93;&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93; Denver;&#91;141&#93;&#91;142&#93; Des Moines;&#91;143&#93; Houston;&#91;144&#93; Louisville;&#91;145&#93; Memphis;&#91;146&#93;&#91;147&#93; Charlotte, North Carolina;&#91;148&#93; Oakland;&#91;149&#93; Portland, Oregon;&#91;150&#93; San Jose;&#91;151&#93; Seattle;&#91;152&#93; outside the White House in Washington;&#91;153&#93; outside Chauvin's summer home in Windermere, Florida;&#91;154&#93; and in many other locations. On May 30, 12 states (including Minnesota) called up the National Guard,&#91;155&#93; and at least 12 major cities imposed curfews on Saturday night.&#91;156&#93;
Floyd's cousin and two brothers were interviewed by CNN. His cousin, Tera Brown, criticized the police, saying, "They were supposed to be there to serve and to protect and I didn't see a single one of them lift a finger to do anything to help while he was begging for his life." One of his brothers echoed the sentiment, saying, "They could have tased him; they could have maced him. Instead, they put their knee in his neck and just sat on him and then carried on. They treated him worse than they treat animals."&#91;157&#93; Floyd's brother, Philonese, called for peace and said, "Everybody has a lot of pain right now, that's why this is happening, I'm tired of seeing black people dying."&#91;158&#93;
Floyd's longtime friend, former professional basketball player Stephen Jackson, expressed anger and sadness, saying video of Floyd's death "just destroyed me".&#91;159&#93;&#91;160&#93;
Floyd's girlfriend asked for the community to respond to his death in a way that honors him. She said: "You can't fight fire with fire. Everything just burns, and I've seen it all day ;– people hate, they're hating, they're hating, they're mad. And he would not want that."&#91;161&#93;
Floyd's uncle, Selwyn Jones, told the Rapid City Journal: "The thing that disturbs me the most is hearing him call for my sister."  Jones also said he expressed disgust about the video to his wife before he knew the identity of the victim.&#91;162&#93; He also spoke out at a memorial rally in Rapid City, South Dakota near where he lives.&#91;163&#93;
Minneapolis City Councillor Andrea Jenkins, who represented Ward ;8, where the incident occurred, was quoted as saying, "My heart is breaking for the tragic loss of life last night near 38th and Chicago. Our community continues to be traumatized again, and again and again. We must demand answers."&#91;164&#93; Governor Tim Walz, in a press conference on the morning of May 29, said "we have to restore order" before actions can be taken to serve justice and address the issues which caused Floyd's death. Walz also announced that he had activated the National Guard.&#91;165&#93; The day prior, Walz used the National Guard to quell the unrest resulting from Floyd's death.&#91;166&#93;
Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said, "Being black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man's neck ;... When you hear someone calling for help, you're supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense." The day after Floyd's death, the Mayor called the termination of the responding officers "the right call".&#91;19&#93;&#91;27&#93; Two days after Floyd's death, Mayor Frey highlighted the racial nature of Floyd's death, and called for Chauvin to be criminally charged: "If most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they'd already be behind bars. That's why today I'm calling on Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to charge the arresting officer in this case."&#91;167&#93;&#91;168&#93; In an interview with CBS that evening, Frey was asked: "Do you think that was murder?" He replied: "I do."&#91;79&#93;
Representative Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota's 5th congressional district (which includes Minneapolis), called for a federal investigation, saying, "It is sickening to watch this black man be killed while helplessly begging for help."&#91;12&#93; She later added, "The police officer who killed George Floyd should be charged with murder."&#91;169&#93; Senator Tina Smith and Governor Tim Walz also called for immediate action.&#91;12&#93; Senator Amy Klobuchar reacted on the following day, saying, "We heard his repeated calls for help. We heard him say over and over again that he could not breathe. And now we have seen yet another horrifying and gut wrenching instance of an African American man dying." She called for the declaration on "a complete and thorough outside investigation into what occurred, and those involved in this incident must be held accountable".&#91;170&#93; However, as a former Hennepin County attorney, she was criticized for declining to press criminal charges against police during her eight years in that office, including against Chauvin; some called for her resignation from the Senate.&#91;171&#93;&#91;172&#93;&#91;173&#93;
President Donald Trump sent his condolences two days later via Twitter, saying he requested that the FBI conduct a thorough investigation. He added, "My heart goes out to George's family and friends. Justice will be served!"&#91;174&#93; Trump also described Floyd's death as "sad and tragic". He sparked controversy following the publication of a tweet on May 29 that read, "These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!"&#91;175&#93; A week later, on June 1, President Trump threatened to deploy the military to stop the protests if state could not manage them by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807.&#91;176&#93;
Former U.S. president Barack Obama published a statement through Twitter calling for a "new normal" that ends the legacy of institutional racism.&#91;177&#93;&#91;178&#93; Former U.S. president George W. Bush and his wife, Laura Bush, issued a statement that they are "anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country."&#91;179&#93;
U.S. ambassadors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and China expressed concern and condemnation of the killing.&#91;180&#93;
The British Labour Party's MPs Claudia Webbe and David Lammy criticized the death of Floyd. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that racism was real and existed in both the United States and Canada. He then urged Canadians to stand up against it.&#91;181&#93;
Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, condemned it as yet another killing of unarmed African-Americans, and called on the United States to take "serious action" and end the repeat of such killings. She also urged protestors to "express their demands for justice peacefully" and for police to refrain from further use of excessive force.&#91;182&#93;
Countries criticized by the United States for violations of human rights used the incident to criticize the U.S. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia said the United States had a history of systemic human rights abuse. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan blamed Floyd's death on a "racist and fascist approach" by the United States and said Turkey will be monitoring the issue. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran, retweeted a tweet saying people with dark skin faced being killed "in the next few minutes" if they walked out on American streets.&#91;181&#93;&#91;183&#93;
African Union officials, including the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat, criticized the killing. U.S. embassies in Africa also condemned the incident, in a move that was described by the media as unusual.&#91;184&#93;&#91;185&#93;
The Dalai Lama, in India while teaching students, condemned the killing of George Floyd by saying, "there are some who even take it as a pride to be able to kill somebody."&#91;186&#93;
The Foreign Ministry of China denounced the killing of George Floyd with the statement: "The death of George Floyd reflects the severity of racial discrimination and police brutality in the US".&#91;187&#93;
The local police union expressed support of the officers involved, saying, "The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis will provide full support to the involved officers." They also urged the public to remain calm, saying, "Now is not the time to rush to judgement and immediately condemn our officers."&#91;188&#93;&#91;189&#93;
The Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association applauded Minneapolis Chief Arradondo's swift firing of the officers involved.&#91;190&#93;
Police across the country were sharply critical of Chauvin's actions. Leaders from organizations which include hundreds of thousands of police officers condemned the four officers' conduct. National Association of Police Organizations Executive Director William Johnson called the incident egregious, and said, "I don't know the entire story, but I can't see any legal justification, any self-defense justification, or any moral justification."&#91;191&#93; Fraternal Order of Police President Patrick Yoes said authorities must ensure justice is served in Floyd's death, "whatever the consequences".&#91;192&#93;
Police chief associations from across the country expressed dismay at Floyd's treatment.&#91;193&#93; The heads of both the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) condemned what was seen on the video. The MCCA, led by Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, said, "The death of Mr. ;Floyd is deeply disturbing and should be of concern to all Americans. The officer's actions are inconsistent with the training and protocols of our profession and MCCA commends Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo for his swift and decisive action to terminate the employment of the officers involved." The National Police Foundation President said, "These actions, and inaction, jeopardize the gains that have been made through the sacrifices and courage of many."&#91;193&#93;
Leaders of individual police departments from around the United States spoke out against the officer at the center of the video, with what The Washington Post called "disgust", and the Los Angeles Times called "blunt criticism".&#91;193&#93;&#91;194&#93; The Los Angeles Times said: "It was a rare moment when police leaders were unequivocal in their public disdain for the conduct of one of their own."&#91;194&#93; Leaders condemning the officer's actions included the New York City Police Commissioner,&#91;194&#93; the Sheriffs of Los Angeles&#91;194&#93; and San Diego counties,&#91;195&#93; and the Police Chiefs of Los Angeles,&#91;193&#93;&#91;194&#93; Boston,&#91;196&#93; Miami,&#91;193&#93; Houston,&#91;193&#93;&#91;194&#93; and Austin,&#91;197&#93; as well as a former Police Chief from Seattle.&#91;190&#93; Police chiefs of smaller cities spoke out as well: Chiefs of Police from Buffalo Grove, Illinois;&#91;193&#93; Tucson, Arizona;&#91;193&#93; Round Rock, Texas;&#91;197&#93; the University of Texas at Austin;&#91;197&#93; Pflugerville, Texas;&#91;198&#93; and Omaha, Nebraska,&#91;199&#93; all issued statements against Floyd's treatment.
A deputy sheriff in Jones County, Mississippi was fired for posting on social media: "If he can scream he can breath (sic), something else was going on."&#91;200&#93;
Experts on the use of force by police condemned Chauvin's actions. Mylan Masson, a longtime Minneapolis police officer and former director of the Hennepin Technical College's Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Center, which instructs approximately half of Minnesota's police officers, said a form of the technique seen in the video of Floyd's death was taught until at least 2016. He added, "Once the [officer] is in control, then you release. That's what use of force is: you use it 'til the threat has stopped." George Kirkham, a former police officer and professor emeritus at Florida State University's College of Criminology and Criminal Justice, said, "It was outrageous, excessive, unreasonable force under the circumstances. We're dealing with a [suspected] property offender. The man was prone on the ground. He was no threat to anyone."&#91;190&#93; Seth Stoughton, an associate professor of law at the University of South Carolina, who was also a former police officer, said that placing suspects lying face-down with their hands handcuffed behind their backs for a long period of time was dangerous because it risked positional asphyxia. If an officer places their knee on a suspect's neck in this position, it could cause injury or even death.&#91;201&#93;
The University of Minnesota announced that it would be limiting ties with the Minneapolis Police Department, and that it would no longer contract the local police department for assistance at major events.&#91;96&#93;&#91;202&#93; The Minneapolis School Board passed a resolution at its meeting on June 2, 2020, terminating its relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department.&#91;203&#93;
Minneapolis police officers have a record of administering neck restraints at least 237 times since the beginning of 2015. This includes 44 people  who were rendered unconscious. Several law enforcement professionals said the number of unconscious individuals as a result of this maneuver seems remarkably large. Neck restraints are defined by police "as when an officer uses an arm or leg to compress someone’s neck without directly pressuring the airway." As depicted on video, a policeman named Derek Chauvin applied his knee to George Floyd's neck while Floyd was handcuffed and lying prone on the ground. Such force was applied "for eight minutes — including nearly three minutes after he had stopped breathing.&#91;204&#93;
The use of the choke hold maneuver known as a "neck restraint" has been derided by more than a dozen law enforcement officials, who were interviewed by NBC News. The news organization provided a summation of their views: "the particular tactic Chauvin used — kneeling on a suspect’s neck — is neither taught nor sanctioned by any police agency." A Minneapolis city official said, "Chauvin's tactic is not permitted by the Minneapolis police department." In general, police departments' application of assorted types of neck restraints, described as choke holds, are decidedly circumscribed - if not plainly illegal. The Minneapolis Police Department’s policy &amp; Procedure manual prohibits the application of neck restraints when the subject is passively resisting&#91;205&#93; but in other narrowly circumscribed circumstances authorizes the application of neck restraints "that can render suspects unconscious" while classifying them as " 'non-deadly' force options" for officers trained in their use,&#91;206&#93; but only to the sides of the neck.&#91;205&#93; 
Applying a knee to the neck of a man lying on his stomach is widely rejected by law enforcement professionals because it can cause suffocation due to positional asphyxia.&#91;206&#93; At the same time, keeping a man in a prone position, with hands cuffed behind his back is meant to be of very short duration and is seen as dangerous because breathing is immediately restricted in that position. "Someone in that position can draw enough breath to gasp or speak in spurts, but they can't breathe fully, so they gradually lose oxygen and fall unconscious." The individual has to be quickly rolled on his side, sat up, or stood up. Pressure on a detainee's neck can "cause fatal damage" so the maneuver must be monitored closely for the well-being of the detainee. According to the Minneapolis department's manual, specialized training is required to use this maneuver. According to Minneapolis police policy this maneuver can only be used as a last resort when there is no other way to subdue a suspect who is belligerently resisting arrest. Chauvin's actions may have exceeded his purview.&#91;207&#93;

Minneapolis (/ˌmɪniˈæpəlɪs/&#32;(listen)) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the principal city of the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States.&#91;3&#93; As of 2019&#91;update&#93;, Minneapolis has an estimated population of 429,606, making it the 46th-largest city in the United States.&#91;4&#93; Minneapolis and its neighbor Saint Paul make up the Twin Cities, with Minneapolis being the larger of the two. The Twin Cities metro and their surrounding suburbs contain about 3.63 ;million people, making it the third-largest economic and population center in the Midwest.&#91;6&#93; Minneapolis is the county seat of Hennepin County.&#91;7&#93;
Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. Due in part to its high degree of accessibility, the city is routinely ranked as having the best park system in the United States.&#91;8&#93; Minneapolis was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle. Minneapolis is home to five Fortune 500 companies, and the Twin Cities are the fifth-largest hub of major corporate headquarters in the United States.
Minneapolis has one of the largest LGBT populations in the U.S.&#91;9&#93; Noted for its strong music and performing arts scenes, Minneapolis is home to both the award-winning Guthrie Theater and the historic First Avenue nightclub. Reflecting the region's status as a center of folk, funk, and alternative rock music, the city served as the launching pad for several of the 20th century's most influential musicians, including Bob Dylan and Prince.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; Minneapolis has also become noted for its underground and independent hip-hop and rap scenes, producing artists such as Lizzo, Brother Ali, Atmosphere, and Dessa.&#91;12&#93; Renowned for its investment in biking infrastructure, the city is regularly named the best biking city in the United States.&#91;13&#93;
The Dakota name for Minneapolis is Bdeóta Othúŋwe (Many Lakes City).&#91;14&#93; Several names were proposed for the new city after its incorporation, including Lowell, Adasville, and Albion, with the latter name suggested by Hennepin County itself.&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; Daniel Payne, John H. Stevens, and George Bowman contributed to replacing Albion.&#91;16&#93; While the name All Saints was facetiously suggested in the St. Paul Pioneer, implying the town would come to absorb its neighbors of Saint Paul and Saint Anthony, the name Minneapolis was ultimately chosen.&#91;15&#93; The present name is attributed to Charles Hoag, the city's first schoolmaster, who suggested Minnehapolis, derived from Minnehaha, and combined mni, a Dakota word for water and the Greek words nea and polis, for new and city respectively; altogether meaning new water city.&#91;15&#93;
The Dakota Sioux were the region's sole residents when French explorers arrived in 1680. Gradually, more European-American settlers arrived, competing for game and other resources with the Native Americans. By the Treaty of Paris following the Revolutionary War, British land east of the Mississippi River became part of the United States.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; In the early 19th century, the United States acquired land to the west of the river from France in the Louisiana Purchase. Fort Snelling was built in 1819 by the U.S. Army at the southern edge of present-day Minneapolis and also bordering Saint Paul as the U.S. military's most remote outpost,&#91;19&#93; to direct Indian trade away from the French and English to the U.S., and to prevent the Dakota and Ojibwe in the north from fighting each other.&#91;20&#93; The fort attracted traders, settlers and merchants, spurring growth. Agents of the St. Peters Indian Agency built at the fort enforced U.S. policy of assimilating Native Americans into European-American society, asking them to give up hunting for subsistence and to learn to plow for cultivation.&#91;21&#93; The U.S. government pressed the Dakota to sell their land which was ceded in a succession of treaties. The U.S. reneged on the treaties during the Civil War, resulting in hunger, war, internment, and exile of the Dakota from Minnesota.
Outwitting the fort's commandant, Franklin Steele laid his claim on the east bank of Saint Anthony Falls,&#91;20&#93; and Stevens built his home on the west bank.&#91;22&#93; The Minnesota Territorial Legislature authorized Minneapolis as a town in 1856, on the Mississippi's west bank. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867 and later joined with the east-bank city of St. Anthony in 1872.&#91;23&#93;
Minneapolis developed around Saint Anthony Falls, the highest waterfall on the Mississippi River and a source of power for its early industry. Forests in northern Minnesota were a valuable resource for the lumber industry, which operated seventeen sawmills on power from the waterfall.
By 1871, the west river bank had twenty-three businesses, including flour mills, woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and planing wood.&#91;24&#93; Due to the occupational hazards of milling, six local sources of artificial limbs were competing in the prosthetics business by the 1890s.&#91;25&#93; The farmers of the Great Plains grew grain that was shipped by rail to the city's 34 flour mills. Millers have used hydropower elsewhere since the 1st century B.C.,&#91;26&#93; but the results in Minneapolis between 1880 and 1930 were so remarkable the city has been described as "the greatest direct-drive waterpower center the world has ever seen."&#91;27&#93;
A father of modern milling in America and founder of what became General Mills, Cadwallader C. Washburn converted his business from gristmills to truly revolutionary technology, including "gradual reduction" processing by steel and porcelain roller mills capable of producing premium-quality pure white flour very quickly.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93; Some ideas were developed by William Dixon Gray&#91;30&#93; and some acquired through industrial espionage from Hungary by William de la Barre.&#91;29&#93; Charles A. Pillsbury and the C.A. Pillsbury Company across the river were barely a step behind, hiring Washburn employees to immediately use the new methods.&#91;29&#93; The hard red spring wheat that grows in Minnesota became valuable ($0.50 profit per barrel in 1871 increased to $4.50 in 1874),&#91;28&#93; and Minnesota "patent" flour was recognized at the time as the best in the world.&#91;29&#93;
Not until later did consumers discover the value in the bran (which contains wheat's vitamins, minerals and fiber) that "...Minneapolis flour millers routinely dumped" into the Mississippi.&#91;31&#93; After 1883, a Minneapolis miller virtually started a new industry when he began to sell bran byproduct as animal feed.&#91;32&#93; Millers cultivated relationships with academic scientists, especially at the University of Minnesota. Those scientists backed them politically on many issues, such as in the early 20th century when health advocates in the nascent field of nutrition criticized the flour "bleaching" process.&#91;29&#93; At peak production, a single mill at Washburn-Crosby made enough flour for 12 ;million loaves of bread each day;&#91;33&#93; by 1900, 14.1 percent of America's grain was milled in Minneapolis.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93; Further, by 1895, through the efforts of silent partner William Hood Dunwoody, Washburn-Crosby exported four million barrels of flour a year to the United Kingdom.&#91;34&#93; When exports reached their peak in 1900, about one third of all flour milled in Minneapolis was shipped overseas.&#91;34&#93;
Known initially as a kindly physician, Doc Ames led the city into corruption during four terms as mayor just before 1900.&#91;35&#93; The gangster Kid Cann was famous for bribery and intimidation during the 1930s and 1940s.&#91;36&#93; The city made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers.&#91;37&#93;
Different forms of bigotry played roles during the first half of the 20th century. In 1910, a Minneapolis developer started writing restrictive covenants based on race and ethnicity into his deeds. Copied by other developers, the practice prevented minorities from owning or leasing such properties. Though such language was prohibited by state law in 1953 and by the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968, restrictive covenants against minorities remained in many Minneapolis deeds as recently as 2017.&#91;38&#93; The Ku Klux Klan succeeded by entering family life, but effectively was a force in the city only from 1921 until 1923.&#91;39&#93; After Minnesota passed a eugenics law in 1925, the proprietors of Eitel Hospital sterilized about one thousand people at the Faribault State Hospital.&#91;40&#93;
From the end of World War I until 1950, Minneapolis was a "particularly virulent" site of anti-semitism. A hate group known as the Silver Legion of America recruited members in the city and held meetings around 1936 to 1938.&#91;41&#93; Answering bigotry against Jewish doctors, Mount Sinai Hospital opened in 1948 as the first hospital in the community to accept members of minority races and religions on its medical staff.&#91;42&#93;&#91;41&#93;
When the country's fortunes turned during the Great Depression, the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers' rights.&#91;43&#93; A lifelong civil rights activist and union supporter, mayor Hubert Humphrey helped the city establish fair employment practices and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946.&#91;44&#93; In the 1950s, about 1.6% of the population of Minneapolis was nonwhite.&#91;45&#93; Minneapolis contended with white supremacy, participated in desegregation and the civil rights movement, and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement.&#91;46&#93;
During the 1950s and 1960s, as part of urban renewal, the city razed about 200 buildings across 25 city blocks (roughly 40% of downtown), destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture, including the Metropolitan Building. Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with sparking interest in historic preservation in the state.&#91;47&#93;
In 2020, a number of riots and protests broke out in the city following the death of George Floyd on May 25.&#91;48&#93; By June 1, protests spread around the world. &#91;49&#93;
The history and economic growth of Minneapolis are tied to water, the city's defining physical characteristic, which was brought to the region during the last ice age 10,000 years ago. Ice blocks deposited in valleys by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis.&#91;51&#93; Fed by a receding glacier and Lake Agassiz, torrents of water from a glacial river cut the Mississippi riverbed and created the river's only waterfall, Saint Anthony Falls, important to the early settlers of Minneapolis.&#91;52&#93;
Lying on an artesian aquifer&#91;53&#93; and flat terrain, Minneapolis has a total area of 58.4 square miles (151.3 ;km2) and of this 6% is water.&#91;54&#93; Water supply is managed by four watershed districts that correspond to the Mississippi and the city's three creeks.&#91;55&#93; Twelve lakes, three large ponds, and five unnamed wetlands are within Minneapolis.&#91;55&#93;
Battered by logs in the river and reduced by quarrying of its limestone, Spirit Island at one time marked the river at Saint Anthony Falls, until white settlement erased its Dakota tradition. The United States Army Corps of Engineers removed the island from the river in 1960.&#91;56&#93;
The city center is located at 45° ;N latitude.&#91;57&#93; The city's lowest elevation of 686 feet (209 ;m) is near where Minnehaha Creek meets the Mississippi River. The site of the Prospect Park Water Tower is often cited as the city's highest point&#91;58&#93; and a placard in Deming Heights Park denotes the highest elevation. A spot at 974 feet (297 ;m) in or near Waite Park in Northeast Minneapolis, however, is corroborated by Google Earth as the highest ground.
Minneapolis experiences a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa in the Köppen climate classification),&#91;60&#93; typical of southern parts of the Upper Midwest, and is situated in USDA plant hardiness zone 4b, with small enclaves of the city classified as being zone 5a.&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93; The city features very cold, snowy winters and humid, warm to hot summers. As is typical in a continental climate, the difference between average temperatures in the coldest winter month and the warmest summer month is great: 60.1 ;°F (33.4 ;°C).
According to the NOAA, Minneapolis's annual average for sunshine duration is 58%.&#91;64&#93;
As of the 2010 U.S. census, the racial composition was as follows:&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93;
European Americans make up about three-fifths of Minneapolis's population. This community is predominantly of German and Scandinavian descent. There are 82,870 German Americans in the city, making up over one-fifth (23.1%) of the population. The Scandinavian-American population is primarily Norwegian and Swedish. There are 39,103 Norwegian Americans, making up 10.9% of the population; there are 30,349 Swedish Americans, making up 8.5% of the city's population. Danish Americans are not nearly as numerous as there are 4,434 of them, making up only 1.3% of the population. Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish Americans together make up 20.7% of the population. This means that ethnic Germans and Scandinavians together make up 43.8% of Minneapolis's population, and make up the majority of Minneapolis's non-Hispanic white population. Other significant European groups in the city include those of Irish (11.3%), English (7.0%), Polish (3.9%), French (3.5%) and Italian (2.3%) descent. African Americans make up 18.6% of the city's population, with a large fraction hailing from Rust Belt cities such as Chicago and Gary, Indiana over the past three decades.&#91;80&#93;
There are 10,711 individuals who identify as multiracial in Minneapolis: People of black and white ancestry number at 3,551, and make up 1.0% of the population. People of white and Native American ancestry number at 2,319, and make up 0.6% of the population. Those of white and Asian ancestry number at 1,871, and make up 0.5% of the population. Lastly, people of black and Native American ancestry number at 885, and make up 0.2% of Minneapolis's population.
As early as the 16th century, Dakota tribes, mostly the Mdewakanton, were known as permanent settlers near their sacred site of St. Anthony Falls.&#91;23&#93; New settlers arrived during the 1850s and 1860s in Minneapolis from New England, New York, Bohemia&#91;81&#93; (now the Czech Republic)&#91;82&#93; and Canada, and, during the mid-1860s, immigrants from Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark began to call the city home. Migrant workers from Mexico and Latin America also interspersed.&#91;83&#93; Other immigrants came from Germany, Poland, Italy, and Greece. Many Central European immigrants settled in the Northeast neighborhood of the city, which to this day remains diverse and is known for its Czech&#91;84&#93; (see Czech Americans) and Polish cultural heritage. Jews from Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia began arriving in the 1880s and settled primarily on the north side of the city before moving in large numbers to the western suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.&#91;85&#93; Asians came from China, the Philippines, Japan, and Korea. Two groups came for a short while during U.S. government relocations: Japanese during the 1940s, and Native Americans during the 1950s. From 1970 onward, Asians arrived from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. Beginning in the 1990s, a sizable Latino population arrived, along with immigrants from the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia.&#91;86&#93; Like other major cities, the metropolitan area has been an immigrant gateway that had a 127% increase in foreign-born residents between 1990 and 2000.&#91;87&#93;
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the population of Minneapolis to be 422,331 as of 2017, a 10.4% increase since the 2010 census.&#91;88&#93; The population grew until 1950, when the census peaked at 521,718, and then declined until about 1990 as people moved to the suburbs.
Among U.S. cities as of 2006, Minneapolis has the fourth-highest percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual people in the adult population, with 12.5% (behind San Francisco, and slightly behind both Seattle and Atlanta).&#91;89&#93;&#91;90&#93; In 2012, The Advocate named Minneapolis the seventh gayest city in America.&#91;91&#93; In 2013, the city was among 25 U.S. cities to receive the highest possible score from the Human Rights Campaign, signifying its support for LGBT residents.&#91;92&#93;
Racial and ethnic minorities in the city lag behind white counterparts in education, with 15.0% of blacks and 13.0% of Hispanics holding bachelor's degrees compared to 42.0% of the white population. The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes among the highest in the Midwest, but median household income among minorities is below that of whites by over $17,000. Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is half that of whites, though Asian home ownership has doubled. In 2000, the poverty rate for whites was 4.2%; for blacks it was 26.2%; for Asians, 19.1%; Native Americans, 23.2%; and Hispanics, 18.1%.&#91;87&#93;&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93;
In December 2018, the Minneapolis City Council voted to end single-family zoning citywide. At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. The New York Times explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising homelessness rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.&#91;95&#93; Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered "nonconforming" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. Slate Magazine explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.&#91;96&#93; Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact residential racial segregation. Further, Politico Magazine explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and suburban planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room. Minneapolis' new plan would reshape the urban streetscape around walking and mass transit.&#91;97&#93; Minneapolis's approach has been to upzone every single-family neighborhood at once. In addition to cost, single-family neighborhoods constrain the economic potential of cities by limiting growth and contributes to climate change, by necessitating sprawl and long commutes. Increasing housing density, which can be measured as the number of dwelling units per acre of residential area, not including streets, open space, or other non-residential space, can be a way that cities can become more environmentally sustainable.&#91;98&#93;
The Dakota people, the original inhabitants of the area where Minneapolis now stands, believed in the Great Spirit and were surprised that not all European settlers were religious.&#91;100&#93; More than 50 denominations and religions have an established presence in Minneapolis: According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 70% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 46% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant (most of whom being Lutheran due to the city's German and Scandinavian heritage), and 21% professing Roman Catholic beliefs.&#91;101&#93;&#91;102&#93; The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism) collectively make up about 5% of the population, and 23% claimed no religious affiliation.
Those who arrived from New England were for the most part Christian Protestants, Quakers, and Universalists.&#91;100&#93; The oldest continuously used church in the city, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, was built in the Nicollet Island/East Bank neighborhood in 1856 by Universalists and soon afterward was acquired by a French Catholic congregation.&#91;103&#93; The first Jewish congregation in Minneapolis was formed in 1878 as Shaarai Tov (though it has been known since 1920 as Temple Israel) and in 1928 built a synagogue in the East Isles neighborhood.&#91;85&#93; St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral was founded in 1887, opened a missionary school in 1897, and in 1905 created the first Russian Orthodox seminary in the U.S.&#91;104&#93; Edwin Hawley Hewitt designed both St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral and Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church on Hennepin Avenue just south of downtown.&#91;105&#93; The first basilica in the United States, and co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, the Basilica of Saint Mary near Loring Park was named by Pope Pius XI in 1926.&#91;100&#93;
The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Decision magazine, and World Wide Pictures film and television distribution were headquartered in Minneapolis from the late 1940s into the 2000s.&#91;107&#93; Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye met while attending the Pentecostal North Central University and began a television ministry that by the 1980s reached 13.5 ;million households.&#91;108&#93; Today, Mount Olivet Lutheran Church in southwest Minneapolis is the nation's second-largest Lutheran congregation, with about 6,000 attendees.&#91;109&#93; Christ Church Lutheran in the Longfellow neighborhood, designed by Eliel Saarinen with an education building by his son Eero Saarinen, is a National Historic Landmark.&#91;110&#93;

The Minneapolis–St. Paul area is the third largest economic center in the Midwest, behind Chicago and Detroit.&#91;6&#93; During the city's formative years, millers had to pay cash for wheat during the growing season and then hold it until it was needed for flour. This required large amounts of capital, which stimulated the local banking industry and made Minneapolis a major financial center.&#91;119&#93; The economy of Minneapolis today is based in commerce, finance, rail and trucking services, health care, and industry. Smaller components are in publishing, milling, food processing, graphic arts, insurance, education, and high technology. Industry produces metal and automotive products, chemical and agricultural products, electronics, computers, precision medical instruments and devices, plastics, and machinery.&#91;120&#93; The city at one time produced farm implements.&#91;121&#93;

The city adopted instant-runoff voting in 2006, first using it in the 2009 elections.&#91;253&#93; The council has 12 DFL members and one from the Green Party.&#91;254&#93; Election issues in 2013 included funding for a new Vikings stadium over which some incumbents lost their positions.&#91;253&#93; That year, Minneapolis elected Abdi Warsame, Alondra Cano, and Blong Yang, the city's first Somali-American, Mexican-American, and Hmong-American city councilpeople, respectively.&#91;253&#93;&#91;255&#93;&#91;256&#93;
Jacob Frey of the DFL is the current mayor of Minneapolis. The office of mayor is relatively weak but has some power to appoint individuals such as the chief of police. Parks, taxation, and public housing are semi-independent boards and levy their own taxes and fees subject to Board of Estimate and Taxation limits.&#91;257&#93; Lisa Bender is the current president of the City Council.&#91;258&#93;
In 2018, the city council passed the Minneapolis Comprehensive 2040 Plan and submitted it for Metropolitan Council approval. Watched nationally, the plan rezones predominantly single-family residential neighborhoods for triplexes to increase affordable housing, seeks to reduce the effects of climate change, and tries to rectify some of the city's racial disparities.&#91;259&#93;&#91;260&#93; After the Metropolitan Council approved the plan,&#91;261&#93; in November 2019 the city council voted unanimously to allow duplexes and triplexes citywide.&#91;262&#93; The Brookings Institution called it "a relatively rare example of success for the YIMBY agenda" and "the most wonderful plan of the year."&#91;263&#93;
At the federal level, Minneapolis proper sits within Minnesota's 5th congressional district, which has been represented since 2018 by Democrat Ilhan Omar, one of the first two practicing Muslim women and the first Somali-American in Congress. Both of Minnesota's two U.S. Senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, were elected or appointed while living in Minneapolis and are also Democrats.&#91;264&#93;
The Republican Party of Minnesota in January 2014 moved its state headquarters from Saint Paul to the Seward neighborhood of Minneapolis.&#91;265&#93;
Citizens had a unique and powerful influence in neighborhood government. Neighborhoods coordinated activities under the Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP), which ended in 2009.&#91;266&#93; Minneapolis is divided into communities, each containing neighborhoods. In some cases two or more neighborhoods act together under one organization. Some areas are commonly known by nicknames of business associations.&#91;267&#93;
The organizers of Earth Day scored Minneapolis ninth best overall and second among mid-sized cities in their 2007 Urban Environment Report, a study based on indicators of environmental health and their effect on people.&#91;268&#93; Minneapolis has also been cited as one of the most environmentally responsible cities in America.&#91;269&#93;
Early Minneapolis experienced a period of corruption in local government and crime was common until an economic downturn in the mid-1900s. Since 1950 the population decreased and much of downtown was lost to urban renewal and highway construction. The result was a "moribund and peaceful" environment until the 1990s.&#91;270&#93; Along with economic recovery the murder rate climbed. The Minneapolis Police Department imported a computer system from New York City that sent officers to high crime areas. Despite accusations of racial profiling; the result was a drop in major crime. Since 1999 the number of homicides increased during four years.&#91;271&#93; Politicians debated the causes and solutions, including increasing the number of police officers, providing youths with alternatives to gangs and drugs, and helping families in poverty.&#91;272&#93;
Minneapolis has an ordinance, adopted in 2003,&#91;274&#93; that directs local law enforcement officers "not to 'take any law enforcement action' for the sole purpose of finding undocumented immigrants, or ask an individual about his or her immigration status."&#91;275&#93;
From 2006 to 2012, under chief Tim Dolan, the crime rate steadily dropped, and the police benefited from new video and gunfire locator resources, although Dolan was criticized for expensive city settlements for police misconduct.&#91;276&#93; While violent crime dropped (from 6,374 in 2006 to 3,720 in 2011&#91;276&#93;), homicides rose by 105%&#91;277&#93; and rape was at the highest rate among large cities.&#91;278&#93; U.S. News &amp; World Report said in 2011 that Minneapolis tied with Cleveland, Ohio as the 10th most dangerous city in the United States.&#91;279&#93;
A previous administration faced severe criticism after the police shooting of Jamar Clark who died in 2015. Facing new criticism when an Australian woman was murdered by a police officer in July 2017, the resignation of chief Janeé Harteau was secured, and 28-year veteran Medaria Arradondo was appointed chief of police.&#91;280&#93;
The City Council passed a resolution in March 2015 making fossil fuel divestment city policy.&#91;281&#93; With encouragement from city administration, Minneapolis joined seventeen cities worldwide in the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance. The city's climate plan is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 15 percent in 2015 "compared to 2006 levels, 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050".&#91;282&#93;
Minneapolis Public Schools enroll over 35,000 students in public primary and secondary schools. The district administers about 100 public schools including 45 elementary schools, seven middle schools, seven high schools, eight special education schools, eight alternative schools, 19 contract alternative schools, and five charter schools. With authority granted by the state legislature, the school board makes policy, selects the superintendent, and oversees the district's budget, curriculum, personnel, and facilities. In 2017, the graduation rate was 66 percent.&#91;283&#93; Students speak over 100 different languages at home and most school communications are printed in English, Hmong, Spanish, and Somali.&#91;284&#93;&#91;285&#93; Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.&#91;286&#93; Besides public schools, the city is home to more than 20 private schools and academies and about 20 additional charter schools.&#91;287&#93;
Minneapolis's collegiate scene is dominated by the main campus of the University of Minnesota where more than 50,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students attend 20 colleges, schools, and institutes.&#91;288&#93; The graduate school programs ranked highest in 2007 were counseling and personnel services, chemical engineering, psychology, macroeconomics, applied mathematics and non-profit management.&#91;289&#93;
Augsburg University, Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and North Central University are private four-year colleges. Minneapolis Community and Technical College and the private Dunwoody College of Technology provide career training. St. Mary's University of Minnesota has a Twin Cities campus for its graduate and professional programs. Two large principally online universities, Capella University and Walden University, are both headquartered in the city. The public four-year Metropolitan State University and the private four-year University of St. Thomas are among postsecondary institutions based elsewhere with additional campuses in Minneapolis.&#91;290&#93;
The Hennepin County Library system began to operate the city's public libraries in 2008.&#91;291&#93; The Minneapolis Public Library, founded by T. B. Walker in 1885,&#91;292&#93; faced a severe budget shortfall for 2007, and was forced to temporarily close three of its neighborhood libraries.&#91;293&#93; The new downtown Central Library designed by César Pelli opened in 2006.&#91;294&#93; Ten special collections hold over 25,000 books and resources for researchers, including the Minneapolis Collection and the Minneapolis Photo Collection.&#91;295&#93; At recent count, 1,696,453 items in the system are used annually and the library answers over 500,000 research and fact-finding questions each year.&#91;296&#93;
Five major newspapers are published in Minneapolis: Star Tribune, Finance and Commerce, Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, the university's The Minnesota Daily and MinnPost.com. Other publications are the City Pages weekly, the Mpls.St.Paul and Minnesota Monthly monthlies, and the Southwest Journal.&#91;298&#93;
Minneapolis has a mix of radio stations and healthy listener support for public radio. In the commercial market three radio broadcasting companies iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel), Entercom, and Cumulus Media operate the majority of the radio stations in the market. Listeners support three Minnesota Public Radio non-profit stations and two community non-profit stations, the Minneapolis Public Schools and the University of Minnesota each operate a station, and religious organizations run four stations.&#91;299&#93;
The city's first television was broadcast in 1948 by the Saint Paul station and ABC affiliate KSTP-TV 5, an NBC affiliate at the time. The first to broadcast in color was WCCO-TV 4, the CBS owned-and-operated station which is located in downtown Minneapolis.&#91;300&#93; WCCO-TV, FOX affiliate KMSP-TV 9 and MyNetworkTV affiliate WFTC 29 operate as owned-and-operated stations of their affiliated networks. The city and suburbs are also home to independently owned affiliates of NBC (KARE 11), PBS (KTCA-TV/KTCI-TV 2), The CW (WUCW 23) and one independent station (KSTC-TV 45).&#91;301&#93;
A number of movies have been shot in Minneapolis, including The Heartbreak Kid (1972),&#91;302&#93; Slaughterhouse-Five (1972),&#91;303&#93;Ice Castles (1978),&#91;304&#93; Foolin' Around (1980),&#91;305&#93; Take This Job and Shove It (1981),&#91;306&#93; Purple Rain (1984),&#91;307&#93; That Was Then, This Is Now (1985),&#91;308&#93; The Mighty Ducks (1992),&#91;309&#93; Untamed Heart (1993),&#91;310&#93; Beautiful Girls (1996),&#91;311&#93; Jingle All the Way (1996),&#91;312&#93; Fargo (1996),&#91;313&#93; and Young Adult (2011).&#91;314&#93; In television, two episodes of Route 66 were shot in Minneapolis in 1963 (and broadcast in 1963 and 1964).&#91;315&#93;&#91;316&#93; The 1970s CBS situation comedy fictionally based in Minneapolis, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, won three Golden Globes and 31 Emmy Awards.&#91;317&#93;
Half of Minneapolis–Saint Paul residents work in the city where they live.&#91;318&#93; Most residents drive cars, but 60% of the 160,000 people working downtown commute by means other than a single person per auto.&#91;319&#93; The Metropolitan Council's Metro Transit, which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program to allay fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they work late hours.&#91;320&#93;
On January 1, 2011, the city's limit of 343 taxis was lifted.&#91;321&#93;
Minneapolis currently has two light rail lines and one commuter rail line. The METRO Blue Line LRT (formerly the Hiawatha Line&#91;322&#93;) serves 34,000 riders daily and connects the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport and Mall of America in Bloomington to downtown. Most of the line runs at surface level, although parts of the line run on elevated tracks (including the Franklin Avenue and Lake Street/Midtown stations) and approximately 2 miles (3.2 ;km) of the line runs underground, including the Lindbergh terminal subway station at the airport.
Minneapolis's second&#91;323&#93; light rail line, the METRO Green Line shares stations with the Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis, and then at the Downtown East station, travels east through the University of Minnesota, and then along University Avenue into downtown Saint Paul. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. The third line, the Southwest Line (Green Line extension), will connect downtown Minneapolis with the southwestern suburb of Eden Prairie. Completion is expected sometime in 2022.&#91;324&#93; A northwest LRT is planned along Bottineau Boulevard (Blue Line extension) from downtown to Brooklyn Park.&#91;325&#93; Metro Transit recorded 81.9 ;million boardings in 2017, slightly down from 82.6 ;million in 2016. The Blue Line carried 10.7 ;million riders in 2017, breaking its previous record annual ridership total. About 13.1 ;million people rode the Green Line in 2017, up 3.5% from 2016. However, these increases in light rail ridership were offset by a lower number of bus boardings: 55.7 ;million in 2017, compared to about 58.5 boardings in 2016.&#91;326&#93;
The 40-mile Northstar Commuter rail, which runs from Big Lake through the northern suburbs and terminates at the multi-modal transit station at Target Field, opened on November 16, 2009.&#91;327&#93; It uses existing railroad tracks and serves 2,600 daily commuters.&#91;328&#93; Annual ridership on the line increased to over 787,000 in 2017, up 12% from the previous year.&#91;326&#93;
According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 59.9% of working city of Minneapolis residents commuted by driving alone, 7.6% carpooled, 14.2% used public transportation, and 7.3% walked. About 5.1% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 5.9% of working city of Minneapolis residents worked at home.&#91;329&#93; In 2015, 18.2% of city of Minneapolis households were without a car, which decreased to 17.1% in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Minneapolis averaged 1.35 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.&#91;330&#93;
Minneapolis ranked 27th in the nation for the highest percentage of commuters by bicycle in 2011,&#91;331&#93; and was editorialized as the top bicycling city in "Bicycling's Top 50" ranking in 2010.&#91;332&#93; Ten thousand cyclists use the bike lanes in the city each day, and many ride in the winter. The Public Works Department expanded the bicycle trail system from the Grand Rounds to 56 ;mi (90 ;km) of off-street commuter trails including the Midtown Greenway, Little Earth Trail, Hiawatha LRT Trail, Kenilworth Trail, Cedar Lake Trail and the West River Parkway Trail along the Mississippi. Minneapolis also has 40 miles (64 ;km) of dedicated bike lanes on city streets and encourages cycling by equipping transit buses with bike racks and by providing online bicycle maps.&#91;333&#93; Many of these trails and bridges, such as the Stone Arch Bridge, were former railroad lines that have now been converted for bicycles and pedestrians.&#91;334&#93; In 2007 citing the city's bicycle lanes, buses and LRT, Forbes identified Minneapolis the world's fifth cleanest city.&#91;335&#93; In 2010, Nice Ride Minnesota launched with 65 kiosks for bicycle sharing,&#91;336&#93; and 19 pedicabs were operating downtown.&#91;337&#93; In 2016, Nice Ride expanded to 171 stations and 1,833 bikes&#91;338&#93; supplied by PBSC Urban Solutions, a Canadian company.&#91;339&#93;
A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Minneapolis the ninth most walkable of 50 largest cities in the United States.&#91;340&#93;
The Minneapolis Skyway System, seven miles (11 ;km) of enclosed pedestrian bridges called skyways, link eighty city blocks downtown. Second floor restaurants and retailers connected to these passageways are open on weekdays.&#91;341&#93;
Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP) sits on 3,400 acres (1,400 ;ha)&#91;342&#93; on the southeast border of the city between Minnesota State Highway 5, Interstate 494, Minnesota State Highway 77, and Minnesota State Highway 62. The airport serves international, domestic, charter and regional carriers&#91;343&#93; and is a hub and home base for Sun Country Airlines and Compass Airlines.&#91;344&#93; It is also the third-largest hub for Delta Air Lines, who operate more flights out of MSP than any other airline.&#91;345&#93; For terminals serving 25 to 40 ;million passengers, MSP was named the world's best airport for customer experience in North America in 2020 for the fourth consecutive year.&#91;346&#93; Forbes named MSP the No. 2 Best Airport in North America, behind Detroit in 2019.&#91;347&#93;
Minneapolis has seven hospitals, four ranked among America's best by U.S. News &amp; World Report—Abbott Northwestern Hospital (part of Allina), Children's Hospitals and Clinics, Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) and the University of Minnesota Medical Center.&#91;349&#93; Minneapolis VA Medical Center, Shriners Hospitals for Children and Allina's Phillips Eye Institute also serve the city.&#91;350&#93; The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota is a 75-minute drive away.&#91;351&#93;
Cardiac surgery was developed at the university's Variety Club Hospital, where by 1957, more than 200 patients had survived open-heart operations, many of them children. Working with surgeon C. Walton Lillehei, Medtronic began to build portable and implantable cardiac pacemakers about this time.&#91;352&#93;
Hennepin Healthcare opened in 1887 as City Hospital and was also known as Minneapolis General Hospital, Hennepin County General Hospital and HCMC.&#91;353&#93; A public teaching hospital and Level I trauma center,&#91;354&#93; the HCMC safety net counted 643,739 clinic visits and 111,307 emergency and urgent care visits in 2019.&#91;355&#93; In prior years responsible for about 18% of Minnesota's uncompensated care,&#91;356&#93; HCMC provided much less uncompensated care in 2014 because, after the Affordable Care Act came into effect, its charity care declined more than bad debt went up.&#91;357&#93;
Funded in part by assessments on commercial properties, in 2009 Ambassadors of the Minneapolis Downtown Improvement District (DID) began working on 120 blocks of downtown to improve its cleanliness, friendliness and acceptability of behavior. They are employees of Block by Block, a company in Nashville, Tennessee that serves 46 U.S. cities.&#91;358&#93;
Utility providers are regulated monopolies: Xcel Energy supplies electricity, CenterPoint Energy supplies gas, CenturyLink provides landline telephone service, and Comcast provides cable service.&#91;359&#93; The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. Hazardous waste is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites.&#91;359&#93; After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency, the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division plows over 1,000 ;mi (1,610 ;km) of streets and 400 ;mi (640 ;km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back. Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.&#91;360&#93;
Minneapolis has 12 sister cities, as per Sister Cities International:&#91;361&#93;&#91;362&#93;&#91;363&#93;
On the city's website, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, is listed as a sister city since 1973, but the two are not listed as sister cities in the organization's 2014 membership directory.&#91;361&#93;&#91;364&#93;
The city also has an informal connection with:&#91;361&#93;


Central America (Spanish: América Central, pronounced ;[aˈmeɾika senˈtɾal]&#32;(listen), Centroamérica pronounced ;[sentɾoaˈmeɾika]&#32;(listen)) is a region in the southern tip of North America and is sometimes defined as a subregion of the Americas.&#91;1&#93; This region is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west and south. Central America consists of seven countries: El Salvador, Costa Rica, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. The combined population of Central America is estimated at 44.53 ;million (2016).&#91;2&#93;
Central America is a part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from northern Guatemala to central Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury and property damage.
In the Pre-Columbian era, Central America was inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the Isthmo-Colombian peoples to the south and east. Following the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus' voyages to the Americas, Spain began to colonize the Americas. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of Chiapas) were governed by the viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy Juan de O'Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba, which established New Spain's independence from Spain.&#91;3&#93; On 15 September 1821, the Act of Independence of Central America was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the Spanish Empire and provide for the establishment of a new Central American state. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region (i.e. what would become Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) were annexed to the First Mexican Empire; however, in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America until 1838.
In 1838, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent autonomous countries, followed by El Salvador in 1841, Panama in 1903 and Belize in 1981.&#91;citation needed&#93; Despite the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America, there is anecdotal evidence that demonstrates that Salvadorans, Panamanians, Costa Ricans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Nicaraguans continue to maintain a Central American identity. For instance, Central Americans sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. It is not unusual to write "C.A." after the country's name in formal and informal contexts. Governments in the region sometimes reinforce this sense of belonging to Central America in its citizens. For example, automobile licence plates in many of the region's countries include the moniker, Centroamerica, alongside the country's name. Belizeans are mostly associated to be culturally West Indian rather than Central American.

In the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern El Salvador, eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some&#91;6&#93; culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.
Following the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Petén Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the Kowoj and the Itza people – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Petén.&#91;citation needed&#93;
In 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real de Guatemala. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.
The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.
From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The Federal Republic of Central America was a representative democracy with its capital at Guatemala City. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Los Altos, Mosquito Coast, and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.&#91;citation needed&#93;

The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see History of Belize (1506–1862). Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Panama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally and politically linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Audiencia Real de Panama. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa Fé de Bogotá. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.&#91;citation needed&#93;
By the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned 14,000 square kilometres (3.5 ;million acres) of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase banana republic.&#91;7&#93;
After more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict, and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation. Poverty, social injustice, and violence are still widespread.&#91;8&#93; Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere (only Haiti is poorer).&#91;9&#93;
Central America is the tapering isthmus of southern North America, with unique and varied geographic features. The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the Gulf of Mexico lies to the north. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America,&#91;10&#93; while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Atrato River, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.
Of the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At 4,220 meters (13,850 ;ft), Volcán Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:
Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.&#91;11&#93;
Trade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.&#91;12&#93;
Central America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity.&#91;13&#93; The Pacific Flyway is a major north–south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropical realms. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity.&#91;13&#93; The table below shows recent statistics:

Over 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.&#91;21&#93;

From 2001 to 2010, 5,376 square kilometers (2,076 ;sq ;mi) of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with 12,201 square kilometers (4,711 ;sq ;mi). Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with 4,730 square kilometers (1,830 ;sq ;mi), and a gain in the dry forest biome at 2,054 square kilometers (793 ;sq ;mi). Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of 8,574 square kilometers (3,310 ;sq ;mi) of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of 3,050 square kilometers (1,180 ;sq ;mi) of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.&#91;24&#93;
The Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of 111,400 square kilometers (43,000 ;sq ;mi),&#91;25&#93; extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between 600–1,800 metres (2,000–5,900 ;ft) elevation,&#91;25&#93; and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above 1,800 metres (5,900 ;ft) are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.
Laurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than 1,000 meters (3,300 ;ft) above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, and species of Weinmannia, Drimys, and Magnolia.&#91;26&#93; The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilarán and Volcán Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.
The Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund.&#91;27&#93; These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from 1,800–4,000 metres (5,900–13,100 ;ft), on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of 13,200 square kilometers (5,100 ;sq ;mi) and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.&#91;27&#93;

Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (Pharomacrus mocinno), three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata), bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and black guan (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extinction are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of that frog is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America.&#91;26&#93; The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.

Central America is geologically very active, with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring frequently, and tsunamis occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.
Most of Central America rests atop the Caribbean Plate. This tectonic plate converges with the Cocos, Nazca, and North American plates to form the Middle America Trench, a major subduction zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some 60–160 kilometers (37–99 ;mi) off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.&#91;28&#93; For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the 1985 Mexico City earthquake that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in 1902, 1942, 1956, 1982, 1992, 2001, 2007, 2012, 2014, and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.
The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The Motagua Fault is an onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This transform fault cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near Acapulco. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in 1717, 1773, 1902, 1976, 1980, and 2009.
Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the Chixoy-Polochic Fault, which runs parallel to, and roughly 80 kilometers (50 ;mi) to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.&#91;29&#93;
Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972.
Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.
The population of Central America is estimated at 47,448,333 as of 2018.&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; With an area of 523,780 square kilometers (202,230 ;sq ;mi),&#91;32&#93; it has a population density of 91 per square kilometer (240/sq ;mi). Human Development Index values are from the estimates for 2017.&#91;33&#93;
The official language majority in all Central American countries is Spanish, except in Belize, where the official language is English. Mayan languages constitute a language family consisting of about 26 related languages. Guatemala formally recognized 21 of these in 1996. Xinca and Garifuna are also present in Central America.
This region of the continent is very rich in terms of ethnic groups. The majority of the population is mestizo, with sizable Mayan and African descendent populations present, including Xinca and Garifuna minorities. The immigration of Arabs, Jews, Chinese, Europeans and others brought additional groups to the area.
The predominant religion in Central America is Christianity (95.6%).&#91;35&#93; Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Central America in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism became the most popular religion in the region until the first half of the 20th century. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly Protestantism, as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion.&#91;36&#93;

Central America is currently undergoing a process of political, economic and cultural transformation that started in 1907 with the creation of the Central American Court of Justice.
In 1951 the integration process continued with the signature of the San Salvador Treaty, which created the ODECA, the Organization of Central American States. However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.
In 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the Central American Integration System (Sistema para la Integración Centroamericana, or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the Dominican Republic, a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.
On 6 December 2008, SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.&#91;37&#93; No timeline for implementation was discussed.
Central America already has several supranational institutions such as the Central American Parliament, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and the Central American Common Market.
On 22 July 2011, President Mauricio Funes of El Salvador became the first president pro tempore to SICA. El Salvador also became the headquarters of SICA with the inauguration of a new building.&#91;38&#93;
Until recently,&#91;when?&#93; all Central American countries have maintained diplomatic relations with Taiwan instead of China. President Óscar Arias of Costa Rica, however, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007, severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.&#91;39&#93; After breaking off relations with the Republic of China in 2017, Panama established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. In August 2018, El Salvador also severed ties with Taiwan to formally start recognizing the People's Republic of China as the sole China, a move many considered lacked transparency due to its abruptness and reports of the Chinese government's desires to invest in the department of La Union while also promising to fund the ruling party's reelection campaign.&#91;40&#93;
The Central American Parliament (also known as PARLACEN) is a political and parliamentary body of SICA. The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.
Costa Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Ricans as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament's decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Signed in 2004, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. The treaty is aimed at promoting free trade among its members.
Guatemala has the largest economy in the region.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; Its main exports are coffee, sugar, bananas, petroleum, clothing, and cardamom. Of its 10.29 ;billion dollar annual exports,&#91;43&#93; 40.2% go to the United States, 11.1% to neighboring El Salvador, 8% to Honduras, 5.5% to Mexico, 4.7% to Nicaragua, and 4.3% to Costa Rica.&#91;44&#93;
The region is particularly attractive for companies (especially clothing companies) because of its geographical proximity to the[United States], very low wages and considerable tax advantages. In addition, the decline in the prices of coffee and other export products and the structural adjustment measures promoted by the international financial institutions have partly ruined agriculture, favouring the emergence of maquiladoras. This sector accounts for 42 per cent of total exports from El Salvador, 55 per cent from Guatemala, and 65 per cent from Honduras. However, its contribution to the economies of these countries is disputed; raw materials are imported, jobs are precarious and low-paid, and tax exemptions weaken public finances.&#91;45&#93;
They are also criticised for the working conditions of employees: insults and physical violence, abusive dismissals (especially of pregnant workers), working hours, non-payment of overtime. According to Lucrecia Bautista, coordinator of themaquilas sector of the audit firm Coverco,labour law regulations are regularly violated in maquilas and there is no political will to enforce their application. In the case of infringements, the labour inspectorate shows remarkable leniency. It is a question of not discouraging investors. "Trade unionists are subject to pressure, and sometimes to kidnapping or murder. In some cases, business leaders have used the services of the maras. Finally, black lists containing the names of trade unionists or political activists are circulating in employers' circles.&#91;45&#93;
Economic growth in Central America is projected to slow slightly in 2014–15, as country-specific domestic factors offset the positive effects from stronger economic activity in the United States.&#91;46&#93;

Tourism in Belize has grown considerably in more recent times, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Belizean Prime Minister Dean Barrow has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country.&#91;49&#93; The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Belize's tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming almost one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2012.&#91;50&#93; Belize is also the only country in Central America with English as its official language, making this country a comfortable destination for English-speaking tourists.&#91;51&#93;
Costa Rica is the most visited nation in Central America.&#91;52&#93; Tourism in Costa Rica is one of the fastest growing economic sectors of the country,&#91;53&#93; having become the largest source of foreign revenue by 1995.&#91;54&#93; Since 1999, tourism has earned more foreign exchange than bananas, pineapples and coffee exports combined.&#91;55&#93; The tourism boom began in 1987,&#91;54&#93; with the number of visitors up from 329,000 in 1988, through 1.03 ;million in 1999, to a historical record of 2.43 ;million foreign visitors and $1.92-billion in revenue in 2013.&#91;52&#93; In 2012 tourism contributed with 12.5% of the country's GDP and it was responsible for 11.7% of direct and indirect employment.&#91;56&#93;
Tourism in Nicaragua has grown considerably recently, and it is now the second largest industry in the nation. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has stated his intention to use tourism to combat poverty throughout the country.&#91;57&#93; The growth in tourism has positively affected the agricultural, commercial, and finance industries, as well as the construction industry. The results for Nicaragua's tourism-driven economy have been significant, with the nation welcoming one million tourists in a calendar year for the first time in its history in 2010.&#91;58&#93;
The Inter-American Highway is the Central American section of the Pan-American Highway, and spans 5,470 kilometers (3,400 ;mi) between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Panama City, Panama. Because of the 87 kilometers (54 ;mi) break in the highway known as the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between Central America and South America in an automobile.

Recognized
Same-sex marriage became legal in Costa Rica on May 26, 2020, as a result of a ruling by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica. Costa Rica is the first country in Central America to recognize and perform same-sex marriages.&#91;1&#93;
On August 8, 2018, the Supreme Court of Costa Rica declared the sections of the Family Code prohibiting same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional, and gave the Legislative Assembly 18 months to reform the law accordingly, otherwise the ban would be abolished automatically. The ruling was published in the judicial bulletin on November 26, 2018, meaning that same-sex marriage would become legal no later than May 26, 2020. This followed a ruling issued in January 2018 by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights stating that American Convention on Human Rights signatory countries are required to allow same-sex marriage.
The legal recognition of same-sex unions in Costa Rica has been debated periodically since 2006, with the debate resurfacing in May 2009 and causing significant controversy due to the strong influence of the Catholic Church in the nation.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; 
In August 2008, a group opposed to same-sex unions asked the Costa Rican electoral authority, the Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones (TSE), to hold a referendum on the subject, an action opposed by most organizations supporting same-sex civil unions in the country.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93; On November 5, 2008, the TSE authorized the group to start collecting the signatures required by law to trigger the referendum (5% of registered voters).&#91;8&#93; By July 2010, the required signatures had been collected and the TSE started the process to hold the referendum on December 5, 2010.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; In the meantime, several organizations and individuals, including the Ombudsman Office of Costa Rica, asked the Supreme Court to consider the legality of the proposed referendum.&#91;11&#93; On August 10, 2010, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court (Sala IV) declared such a referendum unconstitutional. The Court concluded that same-sex couples constituted a disadvantaged minority group subject to discrimination, and that allowing a referendum regarding their rights could potentially enable the non-LGBT majority to limit the rights of same-sex couples and thereby increase discrimination. It then fell to Costa Rica's Congress to legislate for same-sex unions.&#91;12&#93;&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93;
On July 2, 2013, the Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a measure that could legalize same-sex civil unions as part of a larger bill amending the General Young Person's Act (Spanish: Ley General de la Persona Joven). The passing of the bill was widely acknowledged to be a mistake by legislators unaware of its implications; those voting for the bill included legislators vocally opposed to LGBT rights. The mistake, however, did not impact the legality of the bill. The bill changed article 22 of the General Young Person's Act to recognize: "The right to recognition without discrimination contrary to human dignity, social and economic effects of domestic partnerships that constitute publicly, notoriously unique and stable, with legal capacity for marriage for more than three years." The bill also changed the country's Family Code to allow couples living together for three years or more to be recognized as having a common-law marriage, which would grant them the benefits of legal partners such as alimony.&#91;16&#93; The final approved version of the bill did not give marriage a definition limited by sex.&#91;17&#93; On July 4, 2013, President Laura Chinchilla signed the bill into law. A statement from the Minister of Communication said that it was not up to her to veto that bill and that the responsibility for interpreting it lay with legislators and judges.&#91;18&#93;
In July 2013, a same-sex couple filed an appeal with the Supreme Court asking for their union to be recognized under the new law. LGBT rights activists reacting to the law said it needed to survive a constitutional challenge in court.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; Some constitutional lawyers stated that same-sex couples would "still lack legal capacity" to formalize their unions, despite the passage of the law.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;
On December 3, 2014, Vice President Ana Helena Chacón confirmed that four same-sex union proposals would be debated starting in January 2015. President Luis Guillermo Solís said on November 27 that he supported a coexistence initiative to grant couples economic rights, but not any of the civil union proposals equivalent to marriage.&#91;23&#93; In mid-March 2015, the government promised to prioritize two bills on the matter, submitted to the parliament.&#91;24&#93; On August 12, 2015, the Government sent a partnership proposal to the Legislative Assembly extraordinary sessions, seeking to make Article 242 of the Family Code's definition of cohabitation gender-neutral.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93;
In June 2015, a Costa Rican judge granted a common-law marriage to a same-sex couple, Gerald Castro and Cristian Zamora, basing his ruling on the July 2013 legislation.&#91;27&#93; Conservative groups subsequently filed a suit accusing the judge of breach of duty. A criminal court cleared the judge in April 2018.&#91;28&#93;
In early July 2018, six deputies from the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) introduced a civil union bill (bill nr. 20.888) to the Legislative Assembly. Under the proposed bill, same-sex couples would be granted almost all of the rights of marriage, including pension, tax benefits, housing, immigration rights, etc, via recognition of civil unions rather than marriages, with civil unions and marriages proposed to require the use of different registries.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; The bill, with identical text, was presented in September 2019 by the New Republic and Social Christian Unity parliamentary groups for the same reason as initially introduced: to establish the legal figure of "civil cohabitations" (convivientes civiles) as a replacement for allowing same-sex couples access to the figure of marriage.&#91;29&#93; However, these bills would not have granted the same rights as marriage, excluding adoption rights, access to loans, citizenship for non-citizens who marry a Costa Rican national, and divorce settlements.&#91;32&#93;&#91;33&#93; The bill was criticized by other parties, including the conservative National Restoration Party, whose speaker, Pastor Eduardo Cruickshank, described it as "irresponsible and populist".&#91;34&#93; The civil union bill was rejected by the human rights committee on October 15, 2019.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93; 
On May 23, 2006, the Supreme Court ruled against same-sex couples seeking to be legally married. In a 5-2 decision, the Court ruled that it was not required by the country's Constitution to recognize same-sex marriage in family law.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;
On March 19, 2015, a bill to legalize same-sex marriage was introduced to the Legislative Assembly by Deputy Ligia Elena Fallas Rodríguez from the Broad Front.&#91;41&#93; On December 10, 2015, the organization Front for Equal Rights (Frente por los Derechos Igualitarios) and a group of deputies from the Citizens' Action Party, the National Liberation Party and the Broad Front presented another bill.&#91;42&#93;&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93; The bill was submitted to the Assembly on January 28, 2016.&#91;45&#93; In December 2016, the Citizens' Action Party (PAC) announced its support for same-sex marriage. Its Equal Marriage project calls for same-sex couples to receive the same rights as opposite-sex couples, including adoption.&#91;46&#93; A few days later, President Luis Guillermo Solís, a member of PAC, confirmed his personal opposition to same-sex marriage. He did, however, restate his commitment to approving a law of coexistence for same-sex couples.&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93;
Costa Rica saw its first same-sex marriage in 2015. The couple, Laura Florez-Estrada and Jasmine Elizondo, were able to marry due to a clerical error where one of the partners was accidentally recorded as the opposite gender.&#91;49&#93; Subsequently, the Civil Registry filed criminal complaint against the couple.&#91;50&#93; In February 2019, the prosecutor's office dropped a court case against the couple.&#91;51&#93;
In April 2017, a Costa Rican citizen and a Mexican citizen who had previously wed in Mexico asked the Costa Rican embassy in Mexico City to recognize their same-sex marriage. However, the Costa Rican Civil Registry denied their request, based on the country's same-sex marriage ban. In May, the couple appealed the Civil Registry's decision, but it rejected their request again in June. The couple appealed to the Supreme Electoral Court, and said that, should it rule against them, they would appeal to the Supreme Court and then to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;
In November 2017, Costa Rica hosted a conference on the marital rights of same-sex couples across Latin America. Speaking at the conference, Vice President Ana Helena Chacón, one of Costa Rica's two vice presidents, announced her support for same-sex marriage.&#91;54&#93;
On January 9, 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled that countries signatory to the American Convention on Human Rights are required to allow same-sex couples to marry.&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93; The ruling&#91;59&#93; states that:
The first same-sex couple was scheduled to get married on January 20. However, on January 18, the Superior Council of Notaries stated that notaries could not perform same-sex marriages until provisions in the Family Code prohibiting such marriages are changed by the Parliament or struck down by the Supreme Court.&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93; This put the Council at odds with the Government and the IACHR, which stated in its ruling that legislative change was not necessary. The couple announced their intention to challenge the council's decision in the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court (Sala IV).&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93; Minister of Justice Marco Feoli reiterated the Government's position that the IACHR ruling was fully binding on Costa Rica.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;
Costa Rica has long been committed to the Inter-American juridical system, and the Constitution of Costa Rica states explicitly that the country's international agreements take precedence over national laws. The Costa Rican Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the IACHR is the definitive interpreter of the American Convention on Human Rights and that all of the Court's rulings are fully binding on Costa Rica.&#91;71&#93;
LGBT activists and human rights groups celebrated the IACHR decision, while the Catholic Church and evangelical groups condemned it.&#91;72&#93; The ruling was met with outrage among conservative and evangelical groups, who said that the Court had disrespected Costa Rica's laws. Some opponents of the ruling called for the country to leave the jurisdiction of the Court, which would require a constitutional amendment. Several supporters of the ruling have argued that local legislation is not required to legalise same-sex marriage, citing a 2016 court decision regarding the legalisation of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), in which the IACHR ruled that presidential and/or governmental decrees are sufficient to implement its decisions.&#91;73&#93;
Most of the candidates in the February 2018 presidential elections announced their support for or willingness to respect the IACHR ruling, with the exception of Fabricio Alvarado, Stephanie Campos and Mario Rendondo, all of them from minor Christian parties. Other candidates had already been in favor of same-sex marriage before the IACHR ruling, including former Labor and Social Security Minister Carlos Alvarado Quesada from the governing Citizens' Action Party (PAC), left-leaning Deputy Edgardo Araya and labor union activist Jhon Vega. The rest of the candidates signaled that they were personally opposed to same-sex marriage but willing to accept the Court's ruling. Fabricio Alvarado, an evangelist of the National Restoration Party, claimed that the Court had "violated" Costa Rica's sovereignty.&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93; In the days following the IACHR ruling, Alvarado began polling in first place with 17%, up from 3-5% prior to the ruling.&#91;75&#93; Support for Carlos Alvarado, a pro-same-sex marriage candidate, also increased considerably.&#91;76&#93;
In the current Legislative Assembly, eight of the ten PAC deputies and José María Villalta, the sole Broad Front deputy, support same-sex marriage.&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93; The remaining two PAC deputies and all the deputies of the National Liberation Party (PLN), the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC), the Social Christian Republican Party (PRSC) and the National Integration Party (PIN) have expressed their support for same-sex civil partnerships only.&#91;77&#93; Of the 14 deputies of the ultra-conservative National Restoration, 12 did not answer, and two expressed their opposition to same-sex marriage without clarifying if they would support same-sex civil partnerships.&#91;77&#93;&#91;79&#93;
In the April 1, 2018, in the presidential runoff between Carlos Alvarado and Fabricio Alvarado, dubbed by some media outlets as a "de facto referendum on same-sex marriage", same-sex marriage supporter Carlos Alvarado won with over 60% of the vote.&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93; Following his win, he said: "I will lead a government for all [men] and all [women]. That shelters all people, without any distinction."
On January 24, the Center for Justice and International Law (Cejil) asked the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court (Sala IV) to rule on the issue of same-sex marriage quickly.&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93;&#91;84&#93; On January 25, the Superior Council of Notaries clarified its position, stating that notaries could not perform same-sex marriages until the Civil Registry issued guidelines on the registration of such marriages.&#91;85&#93; Despite this, one same-sex couple successfully married before a notary in February 2018.&#91;86&#93;&#91;87&#93; The notary in question faced an investigation, but rejected any wrongdoing, stating that he respected international law and took a stand against discrimination when marrying the couple.&#91;88&#93; The marriage was later annulled.&#91;89&#93; An additional eight same-sex couples had applied for marriage certificates by May 2018.&#91;90&#93;
On February 22, 2018, La Nación reported that the Sala IV was reviewing six lawsuits seeking the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country.&#91;91&#93; On March 9, 2018, the Attorney General recommended to the court to abide by the IACHR ruling and declare article 14 of the Family Code, which prohibits same-sex marriage, unconstitutional.&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93; On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Electoral Court stated that same-sex couples could not get married unless Article 14 of the Family Code was either repealed by the Legislative Assembly or struck down by the Supreme Court.&#91;94&#93;&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93;
On July 18, it was announced that the Sala IV would rule on two lawsuits from 2013 and 2015 challenging the constitutionality of Articles 14 and 242 of the Family Code, as well as Article 4 of the 2013 General Young Person's Act, in the first half of August 2018.&#91;97&#93;&#91;98&#93; On August 3, the Commissioner for LGBTI Population Affairs of the Presidency of the Republic, Luis Salazar, presented a letter asking the Sala IV to legalize same-sex marriage, signed by 182 public figures, including former presidents Luis Guillermo Solís, Laura Chinchilla, Óscar Arias and Abel Pacheco.&#91;99&#93;&#91;100&#93;&#91;101&#93; On August 8, 2018, the Sala IV declared all three of the articles in question unconstitutional and gave the Legislative Assembly 18 months (from the publication of the ruling) to amend the laws accordingly. If the Assembly does not comply, both same-sex marriage and same-sex de facto unions will automatically become legal when the deadline passes.&#91;102&#93;&#91;103&#93; The ruling was welcomed by President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, but several lawmakers expressed doubts that the Legislative Assembly would amend the law before the deadline.&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93;
On November 14, the Court released the full written ruling,&#91;106&#93;&#91;107&#93;&#91;108&#93;&#91;109&#93; which was published in the judicial bulletin on November 26, 2018, setting a deadline for legislative action on May 26, 2020.&#91;110&#93;&#91;111&#93;
In anticipation of the ruling taking effect, new guidelines giving same-sex couples access to housing allowance if they have been living together for three years was published in the official gazette La Gaceta in February 2019. The guidelines were adopted in compliance with the 2018 IACHR ruling.&#91;112&#93;
A poll conducted between January 4 and 10, 2012, by La Nación showed that 55% of Costa Ricans supported the statement "same-sex couples should have the same rights as heterosexual couples", while 41% were opposed. Support was higher among people aged 18–34, at 60%.&#91;119&#93;
According to a Pew Research Center survey, conducted between November 9 and December 19, 2013, 29% of Costa Ricans supported same-sex marriage, 61% were opposed.&#91;120&#93;&#91;121&#93;
A poll carried out in August 2016 by the Centro de Investigación y Estudios Políticos (CIEP) indicated that 49% of Costa Ricans opposed the legal recognition of same-sex unions, while 45% supported it. 6% were unsure.&#91;122&#93;
The 2017 AmericasBarometer showed that 35% of Costa Ricans supported same-sex marriage.&#91;123&#93;
A poll published in January 2018 by CIEP suggested that 35% of the Costa Rican population supported same-sex marriage, with 59% opposed.&#91;124&#93;&#91;125&#93;

Pakistan International Airlines (Urdu: پاکستان انٹرنیشنل ایئر لائنز&#8206;; abbreviated PIA, Urdu: پی‌آئی‌اے&#8206;) is the national flag carrier of Pakistan under the administrative control of the Secretary to the Government of Pakistan for Aviation. Its central hub is Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, while Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore, and Islamabad International Airport serve as secondary hubs.
PIA was founded on 29 October 1946 as Orient Airways, and was initially based in Calcutta, British India, before shifting operations to the newly independent state of Pakistan in 1947. Orient Airways was nationalised to form the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC).&#91;6&#93; The new airline commenced international services in 1955 to London, via Cairo and Rome.&#91;7&#93; PIA became the first Asian airline to operate jet aircraft with the induction of the Boeing 707 into commercial service on 7 March 1960,&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; and later in 1964 became the first non-communist airline to fly to China.&#91;11&#93; The airline played a vital role in the establishment of the Emirates airline in 1985.&#91;12&#93; In 2004, PIA become the launch customer of the Boeing 777-200LR.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93; On 10 November 2005 used the Boeing 777-200LR to complete the world's longest nonstop flight by a commercial airliner. This flight lasted 22 hours and 22 minutes on the eastbound route between Hong Kong and London.&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93;
PIA is Pakistan's largest airline and operates a fleet of more than 30 aircraft. The airline operates nearly 100 flights daily, servicing 18 domestic destinations and 25 international destinations across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America.&#91;2&#93; In addition to commercial flight operations, PIA also owns The Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, and the Sofitel Paris Scribe Hotel in Paris.&#91;17&#93; The airline operates a frequent flier programme, PIA Awards +, and has several codeshare and interline agreements. However, it is not part of any airline alliance.
Pakistan International Airlines can trace its origins to the days when Pakistan had not yet come into existence following the end of the British Raj and the Partition of British India. In 1945, the country's founder Muhammed Ali Jinnah realized the need for a flag carrier for the prospective country and requested financial help from wealthy businessmen Mirza Ahmad Ispahani and Adamjee Haji Dawood for this purpose.&#91;18&#93; As a result, the new airline Orient Airways Limited, was registered in Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) on 23 October 1946.&#91;18&#93; Orient became the first and only Muslim owned airline in the British Raj.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93;
In February 1947, the airline bought three Douglas DC-3 aircraft and obtained a licence to fly in May of the same year.&#91;18&#93; The airline started its operations on 30 June 1947, offering services in British India from Calcutta to Sittwe and Rangoon (present-day Yangon).
On 14 August 1947, Pakistan gained independence and Orient Airways started relief operations for the new country. The airline was entrusted with the task of servicing air routes between East and West Pakistan.&#91;18&#93; By 1949, Orient acquired 3 Convair CV-240s to service the Karachi-Delhi-Calcutta-Dhaka route, and became the first Asian airline to operate Convair aircraft.&#91;18&#93;
Orient's traffic continuously declined until 1953 as Britain's BOAC had been granted rights to carry passengers between the two wings of Pakistan, while two other local competitors also began serving Orient routes.&#91;18&#93; As a result of losses, the Pakistani government began subsidizing Orient's operations through a 1952 contract for the purchase of 3 Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellations registered to the government's newly established subsidiary, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), at the cost of 25 ;million rupees.&#91;18&#93; PIA had been established as a department of Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, and was tasked with operation and maintenance of the new Lockheed aircraft.&#91;18&#93;
Pakistan's government established the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation through the merger Orient Airways with Pakistan International Airlines on 1 October 1953 by an interim joint operating agreement in which the government assumed financial control of the airline, while Orient's operations and ground assets could be complemented by the aircraft of Pakistan International Airlines - although Orient Airways continued to operate under its name for a few more years.&#91;18&#93;
Pakistan's Ministry of Defence took over operations from the Civil Aviation Authority in early 1954, while the chairman of Orient Airways became the CEO of PIA, and foreign staff brought in to help relaunch the airline.&#91;18&#93; On 7 June 1954, Orient Airways began nonstop flight services between East- and West Pakistan, with service from Karachi to Dhaka using Pakistan International Airlines' Lockheed aircraft that had been ordered in 1952 and delivered in early 1954. The route was subsidized by the government so that middle-class Pakistanis could afford to fly the route, with rates that may have been the lowest in the world at the time.&#91;18&#93; The airline also introduced two new domestic routes: Karachi–Lahore–Peshawar and Karachi–Quetta–Lahore.
On 11 March 1955, Orient Airways and Pakistan International Airlines were formally merged as part of the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ordinance, 1955. Orient Airways ceased operations while the government of Pakistan took a majority holding in the airline.&#91;18&#93; The new PIA had a fleet of 3 L-I049C Super Constellations, 2 Convair CV-240s, and 11 DC-3s.&#91;18&#93;
The newly relaunched airline also inaugurated its first international route, Karachi-London Heathrow Airport&#91;21&#93; via Cairo and Rome, using the newly acquired Lockheed L-1049C Super Constellations. The airline continued using DC-3s on domestic routes in Pakistan. PIA carried 113,165 passengers in 1955 - 50% higher than in 1954.&#91;18&#93;
In May 1956, PIA ordered five Vickers Viscount 815s. The airline also entered into a partnership with PanAm to train PIA's personnel in 1956.&#91;18&#93; In 1957–1958, passenger numbers rose to 208,000, necessitating the purchase of 2 additional Lockheed Super Constellations.&#91;18&#93; The appointment of Air Marshal Nur Khan as the managing director of PIA in 1959 heralded an era of success for PIA.
In February 1960, PIA wet-leased a Boeing 707 from Pan American airlines and introduced it onto the Karachi-London route on 7 March 1960 initially using PanAm pilots,&#91;8&#93; thereby becoming the first Asian airline to induct and commercially operate a jet aircraft in its fleet.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;&#91;11&#93; - Air India took delivery of a 707 earlier on 21 February 1960, but did not induct the aircraft into commercial service until 19 April 1960.&#91;23&#93; An all-Pakistani crew began operation of the 707 from 20 June 1960 onwards.&#91;18&#93; By the end of 1960, PIA, for the first time, entered financial profitability.&#91;18&#93;
With the newly acquired aircraft, the airline introduced its first trans-Atlantic route Karachi-New York via London on 5 May 1961,&#91;18&#93; which was suspended in February 1963.&#91;24&#93; In 1961, it expanded its fleet by placing orders for 3 Boeing 720s, which were delivered in 1962.&#91;18&#93; On 2 January 1962, a PIA Boeing 720B flown by Captain Abdullah Baig from London to Karachi established a world record for speed over a commercial airline route of 938.78 ;km/h (582.98 ;mph), a record which still holds to this day.&#91;25&#93; Fokker F27 Friendships, and Sikorsky helicopters were also ordered and delivered in 1963, with the helicopters used to provide air service to 20 towns in East Pakistan until 1966.&#91;18&#93;&#91;26&#93;
The helicopters were retired in 1966 and a reduced network of eight cities was served by Fokker F27 aircraft.&#91;26&#93; Upon the establishment of ties between Pakistan and the People's Republic of China, PIA started flying the Dhaka-Canton-Shanghai route on 29 April 1964, becoming the first airline of a non-communist country flying to the People's Republic of China.&#91;27&#93;&#91;18&#93; On 10 May 1964, PIA became the first non-Soviet airline offering flights to Europe via Moscow.&#91;18&#93;
At the outbreak of Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Pakistani Armed Forces used PIA's services for logistics and transport purposes. The Viscounts were phased out in 1966 and were replaced by four Hawker Siddeley Tridents.
PIA's route grew rapidly in the mid to late 1960s: Dhahran was added in 1965, while Cairo services resumed. In 1966, Paris, Istanbul, Baghdad, Kuwait, Jeddah and Nairobi were added to PIA's routes. Bangkok was added in 1967, while Manila, Tokyo, and Damascus were added in 1969.&#91;18&#93;
On 3 December 1971, a French national's attempt to hijack a PIA flight from Paris to Karachi was thwarted by French security forces.&#91;29&#93; Transatlantic flights to New York City were resumed in May 1972 with a stopover in Europe.&#91;24&#93; With the establishment of cordial ties between the Libyan and Pakistani governments in the early '70s, PIA added Tripoli to its network in 1972. PIA also signed an agreement with Yugoslav airline JAT in 1972 to lease 2 PIA Boeing 707s to JAT.&#91;30&#93;
PIA acquired McDonnell Douglas DC-10s in 1973 to replace its remaining Boeing 707-300s. Nur Khan was appointed as PIA executive for the second term in 1974.&#91;24&#93; In 1974, PIA launched Pakistan International Cargo, offering air freight and cargo services. In 1975, PIA introduced new uniforms for air hostesses, which were chosen through an open competition, with the winning entry designed by Hardy Amies.
The latter half of the decade witnessed a further expansion of PIA's fleet with the introduction of Boeing 747s, with its first two aircraft leased from TAP Air Portugal in 1976.&#91;31&#93; By 1976–7, PIA carried 2.2 ;million passengers, compared to 698,000 in 1972–3.&#91;32&#93; Revenues in 1976 rose sharply compared to 1975, with the airline revenues of $134 ;million in the July–December period of 1976.&#91;33&#93; On 20 January 1978, a PIA Fokker 27 was hijacked en route to Karachi from Sukkur.&#91;34&#93;
For the first time since its inauguration, PIA started providing technical and administrative assistance or leased aircraft to foreign airlines including Air China,&#91;35&#93; Air Malta,&#91;35&#93; Choson Minhang,&#91;36&#93; Philippine Airlines,&#91;37&#93; Somali Airlines,&#91;38&#93; and Yemenia.&#91;38&#93; A subsidiary of PIA also started providing hotel management services in the United Arab Emirates towards the end of the decade. Political upheaval in Pakistan in the late 1970s began to impact PIA's operations negatively.&#91;39&#93;
The 1980s saw a continuation of PIA growth. The decade began with the opening of a cargo handling centre at Karachi airport, duty-free shops, the first C and D safety checks on its entire fleet, as well as the introduction of airline's first Airbus A300B4-200 aircraft. In 1981, PIA had an employee workforce of almost 24,000, which despite being reduced to 20,000 by 1983 still resulted in PIA having the world's highest ratio of employees to aircraft.&#91;39&#93; PIA's operations became increasingly de-centralized during the early 1980s, with responsibilities being split between new departments.&#91;39&#93; Despite de-centralization, PIA reported its highest ever profits in 1981–2,&#91;40&#93; followed by record profits again in 1983–4.&#91;41&#93;
In 1984, the airline introduced Night-Coach service as a low-cost alternative to day-time domestic flights. In the following years, PIA Planetarium was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetariums in Lahore and Peshawar. These planetariums featured retired PIA aircraft on display for educational or observational purposes. Two more retired Boeing 720B aircraft were donated to the planetariums in Karachi and Lahore later on. PIA profits again rose in 1984–5.&#91;42&#93;
In June 1985, PIA became the first Asian airline to operate the Boeing 737-300 aircraft after 6 of the aircraft were delivered to the airline.&#91;43&#93; Pakistan International Airlines also played a significant role in establishing UAE's Emirates airline in 1985 by providing technical and administrative assistance to the new carrier as well as leasing a new Boeing 737-300 and an Airbus A300B4-200.&#91;12&#93; In late 1987 and early 1988, services to Malé, Manchester, and Toronto were introduced.&#91;44&#93;
PIA began to sustain operating losses and liquidity problems throughout the 1990s due to frequent pilot strikes, issues with various vendors, over-staffing, and political interference in airline management.&#91;45&#93; In 1990, First Officer Maliha Sami became the first female pilot of PIA when she took off on the Karachi-Panjgur-Turbat-Gwadar route. In June 1991, PIA took delivery of its first of six Airbus A310-300 aircraft - with the new aircraft, the airline introduced flights to Tashkent in 1992 and to Zürich in 1993.
In March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became managing director of the airline. An Open Skies agreement between Karachi to Dubai was agreed upon in 1993, and 12 private airlines were allowed to operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put enormous pressure on PIA's financial performance, though PIA launched six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries, along with a tourist 'Air Safari' scenic flight over the Karakoram Mountains in 1994. Non-stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada were launched, while PIA added Jakarta, Fujairah, Baku, and Al-Ain to its network in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: Sabre, Galileo, and Amadeus.
A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 to cope with a surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well before being discontinued a few years later. In 1999, PIA leased five Boeing 747-300 aircraft from Cathay Pacific to replace its Boeing 747-200M fleet. The aircraft were painted with a new livery, a handwork Pashmina tail, on white body and large Pakistan titles on the front fuselage. The livery was adopted in the early 90s but due to some copyright issues, it was dropped. The Boeing 747-300s continued to bear the new livery, but with a plain green tail with PIA titles. The other aircraft in the fleet were repainted in early 1990s livery.
The War in Afghanistan following the attacks on 11 September 2001 negatively impacted PIA's operations as Afghan airspace was closed.&#91;45&#93; However, following the restructuring of the airline under new management in April 2001, the airline again became profitable.&#91;45&#93; Cost per employee dropped 24% between 2000 and 2003, which lower engineering and maintenance costs lead to enhanced airline revenue.&#91;45&#93;
In July 2002, PIA purchased six Boeing 747-300 aircraft from Cathay Pacific, five of which were already on lease. The sixth one arrived shortly afterward and was used mainly on its North American and European routes. In October 2002, after ten years without any new orders, the airline placed an order for eight Boeing 777 aircraft. The order included all three variants of 777, i.e. three 777-200ER (Extended Range), two 777-200LR (Longer Range) and three 777-300ER versions. PIA was the launch customer that revived the Boeing 777-200LR project that, until then, only had three orders.
Boeing delivered the first of three 777-200ER aircraft to PIA in January 2004, and PIA introduced a new livery for the 777-200ERs that was applied to most of its fleet. PIA also leased six more Airbus A310-300 aircraft directly from Airbus. On 3 November 2005, PIA placed an order to purchase seven ATR 42-500 aircraft to replace its ageing fleet of Fokker F27 Friendships. On 10 November 2005, PIA used the 777-200LR to fly the world's longest flight by a commercial airliner, flying over 21,000 kilometers on an eastbound flight from Hong Kong to London for 22 hours and 22 minutes&#91;15&#93; - a record which still stands as of late 2019.&#91;16&#93; On 6 December 2005, PIA acquired another new Boeing 777-200ER on a ten-year lease.  On 23 December 2006, PIA took delivery of its first Boeing 777-300ER. The remaining aircraft were delivered in January 2007.
On 25 February 2006, Boeing delivered its first 777-200LR to PIA. ATR delivered two of the seven ordered ATR 42s to PIA in May and December 2006 respectively, following which the airline ceased using military Lockheed C-130 Hercules for passenger services in northern areas of Pakistan. The military aircraft were being used after the PIA Flight 688 accident.
With the induction of long-range 777 aircraft in its fleet, PIA started offering non-stop flights from Toronto to Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore from 3 March 2006. PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York City, Chicago, Washington, and Houston but was not permitted by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities) due to security concerns after 9/11.
A PIA flight from Multan crashed in July 2006, killing 45. A government inquiry afterward blamed aging aircraft for the crash.&#91;46&#93; Houston services also ended in 2006. Following the crash, on 5 March 2007, the European Commission banned all but 9 of PIA's 42-strong fleet from flying to Europe, citing safety concerns over its ageing aircraft.&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93; The fleet of Boeing 777s was exempted from the ban,&#91;49&#93; but 15 aircraft were over 20 years old by this point.&#91;50&#93; PIA claimed that the ban was discriminatory and unjustifiable. On 26 March 2007, Tariq Saeed Kirmani was forced to resign after pressure from authorities because of the EU ban&#91;citation needed&#93;. Zafar Khan was then appointed as the new chairman of Pakistan International Airlines.
The ban on some of the aircraft was lifted after four months on 5 July 2007, following an inspection by the European Union Air Safety Administration. Of the eleven aircraft allowed to resume operations to the EU, five were Boeing 747-300s, and the remaining six were Airbus A310-300s. On 29 November 2007, the EU completely removed the ban, and PIA's entire fleet was permitted to fly to Europe.&#91;51&#93;
In 2010, PIA altered its livery. The tail design was replaced with a much larger version of the Pakistan national flag and added the text "Pakistan International" in gold writing underneath the large billboard-style PIA on the fuselage. The green stripe was modified to include gold and was extended to the rear of the fuselage.
By 2011, PIA began to be unprofitable again, requiring government subsidies.&#91;52&#93; A combination of increased competition from Middle Eastern airlines, rising fuel prices, corporate mismanagement, and over-staffing contributed to PIAs sharp decrease in revenues.&#91;citation needed&#93;
In 2014, PIA leased four Boeing 737-800s. PIA also issued a request for tender for four Boeing 777-300ERs, however, the bids for the 777s were not accepted. The airline did lease Airbus A320 aircraft and inducted two A320-214s in its fleet in 2014. Another wet-leased A320-211s joined PIA on 11 August 2014. In October 2014, the airline again wet-leased three Boeing 737-800s, and it also accepted bids to dry lease five ATR 72–500s for eight years. In 2015, after serving PIA for 16 years, the last of PIA's Boeing 747-300s were phased out.
In early 2016, PIA was fundamentally grounded for an entire week as employees walked out en masse following the deaths of two employees in a demonstration against the airline's privatization.&#91;53&#93; In August 2016, PIA launched a new "Premier Service" for flights to London, using an Airbus A330-300 wet-leased from SriLankan Airlines.&#91;54&#93; The wet-lease period ended after six months, and as a result, the A330-300 was returned to SriLankan Airlines,&#91;55&#93; and the Premier Service discontinued. By the end of 2016, the airline was saddled with $3 ;billion in debt.&#91;53&#93;
In January 2017, PIA retired all of the Airbus A310-300s from its fleet. For replacement, PIA leased four Boeing 737-800s from Pegasus Airlines, which were returned later on completion of the lease period. After over 50 years of service, PIA service to New York ended in October 2017 as a result of TSA regulation preventing nonstop flights from Pakistan and the US,&#91;56&#93; leaving Toronto as PIA's only destination in North America - which continues to be served by nonstop flights from Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.
In 2017, PIA decided to replace its reservation and ticketing system "Sabre" with a Turkish origin system called "Hitit". Both PIA &amp; Hitit signed an agreement and in September 2018, the airline successfully switched to the new system.&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93; At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3 ;billion in debt, up from $2.97 the year before, and thus requiring government bailouts for continued operation.&#91;59&#93; With the demise of Shaheen Air, PIA launched routes that had previously been served only by Shaheen.&#91;56&#93;
New profitable routes were launched in 2019,&#91;60&#93; while profitable routes such as Karachi-Toronto saw increased frequencies.&#91;61&#93; six unprofitable routes were discontinued in 2019.&#91;62&#93; In April 2019, PIA claimed that its revenues almost matched operating costs.&#91;63&#93; Later that year following a visit of TSA officials to the Islamabad International Airport in July 2019, PIA expressed hope that non-stop flights to the US would be permitted.&#91;64&#93; In August 2019, PIA laid off 1,000 "redundant employees."&#91;65&#93; In September, PIA announced that it would lease additional aircraft to increase the airline's fleet to 37 by 2020,&#91;66&#93; and 45 by 2023.&#91;67&#93; By the end of 2019, PIA reported a 41% increase in year-on-year revenue due to discontinuation of unprofitable routes, reintroduction of grounded aircraft, and a sharp increase in the airline cargo space utilization.&#91;68&#93;
For the first time in its history, PIA operated a relief flight from Lahore to Melbourne, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#91;69&#93;
On 22 May 2020, a PIA Airbus A320-214 AP-BLD, crashed near Karachi airport with 99 people on board. The flight was en route to Karachi from Lahore. Flight PK8303, carrying 91 passengers and 8 crew members on board, crashed while on the descent towards the runway of Jinnah International Airport, killing 97 while 2 passengers survived. The cause of the crash is unknown, pending an inquiry.&#91;70&#93;
Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) is majority-owned by the Government of Pakistan (86%) while the remainder (14%) by private shareholders. The airline is under the administration of Aviation Division and is managed by President &amp; chief executive officer as well as the board of directors.
The Board consists of nine independent non-executive members and has four sub-committees: an Audit Committee, Brand and Advertising Committee, Finance Committee, and Human Resource Committee each having its charter and chairman. The President &amp; chief executive officer leads the executive management of staff who run the airline. The airline's main headquarters are located at Karachi,&#91;71&#93; while smaller subhead offices are located in several cities within Pakistan.
In 2013, the Government of Pakistan once again aimed to privatise the airline due to increased losses by selling twenty-six percent of shares &amp; management control to the investor. This plan was dropped due to heavy protest by airline unions and associations in which two employees were killed when security forces were tasked to stop the protesters for their movement towards Jinnah International Airport terminal building.
In 2018, the newly elected government aimed not to privatise the entity and make it a profitable through the change in its top management.&#91;74&#93;
In 2011, PIA began to be unprofitable, requiring government subsidies.&#91;52&#93; A combination of increased competition from Middle Eastern airlines, rising fuel prices, corporate mismanagement, and over-staffing contributed to PIAs sharp decrease in revenues.&#91;citation needed&#93; By the end of 2016, the airline was saddled with $3 ;billion in debt.&#91;53&#93; At the end of 2018, the airline was burdened with $3.3 ;billion in debt, up from $2.97 the year before, and thus requiring government bail outs for continued operation.&#91;59&#93; In April 2019, PIA claimed that its revenues almost matched operating costs.&#91;63&#93; An audit in September 2019 revealed that PIA had operated 46 empty flights between 2016 and 2017, without any passengers causing a loss of $1.1 ;million to the airline. Additionally, 36 Hajj flights were also running without any passengers.&#91;75&#93; By the end of 2019, PIA reported a 41% increase in year-on-year revenue due to discontinuation of unprofitable routes, reintroduction of idle aircraft, and a sharp increase in the airline cargo space utilization.&#91;68&#93;
The airline faces many challenges to its profitability. PIA is considered one of the cheapest airlines.&#91;76&#93; Pakistan faces what has been termed "capacity dumping" by Middle East airlines, who operate numerous daily flights to every major city in Pakistan.&#91;56&#93; Pakistan's Open Skies Agreement with the UAE, for example, allows Emirati airlines an unlimited number of seats into Karachi, with Emirates airlines alone operating up to seven daily flights to Karachi from Dubai on high-capacity Boeing 777s.&#91;56&#93; PIA also discontinued previously profitable routes to the US, as the TSA forbade nonstop flights from Pakistan to the US, and instead required costly diversions to European airports for immigration clearance - resulting in flight times that were significantly longer than flights on Middle Eastern airlines.&#91;56&#93; New routes such as to Najaf and Thailand also did not improve the airline's finances given the seasonality of those destinations.&#91;56&#93; Further, staffing levels and overall management issues, including an employee count of 18,014 in 2010 for a fleet of 40 aircraft,&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93; present further challenges - although in August 2019, PIA laid off 1,000 "redundant employees."&#91;65&#93;
In 2010, PIA carried 1,454,000 ;kg of mail - in 2013, PIA managed just 648,000 ;kg of mail. Additionally, PIA's revenue from excess baggage, passenger load factor, and passenger kilometre flow have been declining steadily.&#91;81&#93;
In 2011, about 81% of revenue was from passenger traffic and only 5% from cargo. Another 7.8% was from food and beverage sales. The remaining 6% was from various sources such as excess baggage charges, air charter services, aircraft maintenance engineering services, ground handling and related services, and carriage of mail.&#91;78&#93;
As of November 2019, PIA serves 19 domestic and 24 international destinations in 16 countries across Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America. Jeddah, Medina and Dubai are major focus cities for the airline, with flights from Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Multan, Sialkot and Faisalabad.
PIA with its Interline agreements and codeshare partner airlines, offers a wider choice of travel in 102 international destinations in 40 countries across the world with different flight connections.
PIA has Codeshare agreements with the following airlines:&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93;
PIA have Interline agreements with the following airlines:&#91;82&#93;
As of May ;2020&#91;update&#93;, the Pakistan International Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:&#91;85&#93;&#91;86&#93;
In December 2003, PIA introduced a new image that was applied to its first Boeing  777-200ER and on two newly leased Airbus A310s, one of which was in service. The livery was white at the front and beige at the rear separated by a dark green stripe. The tail was painted white with a new typeface PIA acronym written in dark green. The Pakistan title was added to the front fuselage in all raised letters and the engine cowlings were painted in beige. The PIA logo written in calligraphic Urdu was added just behind the cockpit. However, due to criticism, the design was modified before the first Boeing 777 was delivered. The tail logo was replaced by a flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background. The "Pakistan" titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The English and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.
In early 2006, the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa and Balochistan. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name to the rear of the fuselage corresponding to the province. The "Frontier" tail represented the "Phulkari" (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts, and linen. The "Punjab" tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore. The "Balochistan" tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets, and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The "Sindh" tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009, management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.
PIA launched its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747-300 were the first aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around the bottom of the fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion was white and at the rear, it was an off-white/beige colour. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, with the rest of the tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green colour. At the front of the fuselage, 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden colour. Just behind the cockpit, there is a stylised Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.
In July 2014, on the delivery of the first A320 series aircraft, PIA introduced a "crescent and star" on the aircraft engines' cowlings in place of the Urdu PIA logo. In 2015, after the completion of sixty years service, the 1960s livery was applied to three of the Airbus A320s and on one Boeing 777-200ER.
In April 2018, PIA formally launched a new brand identity and livery and added a portrait of the Markhor in a ceremony held at PIA Offices in Islamabad, presented by the then head of brand of PIA, having Pakistan's national animal represented on its aircraft, including a large one on the tail and two on the engines, describing the resilient nature of PIA Brand surviving under the onslaught of all the negativity associated with the brand. The symbol of animal was chosen for its universal recognition as the Urdu calligraphy logo of PIA could not be comprehended by non-Pakistani customers. In essence the idea was to make PIA a truly international brand based on the values of resilience, grace and fortitude, something which PIA had lost with increased focus on ethnic traffic. The tail had a forward leaping Markhor having long screw horns, which are the features of 'Kashmiri Markhor' endemic to Pakistan only. According to the initial plan, a euro-white style was chosen and existing green and golden strips were removed from the aircraft fuselage along with off-white/beige colour on the rear fuselage, but later a major rebranding was carried out. The font of the PIA logo was also changed and added to the fuselage. For the first time, legacy PIA colours (Pakistan green and mustard gold) were dropped and a blue texture was added in the "PIA" acronym expanding the colour palette for the brand. Urdu PIA logo colour was also changed from the yellow-green gradient texture. The airline's slogan was also changed to "We Fly at the Right Attitude" from "Great People to Fly With". The first aircraft with the redesigned livery was converted on 12 May 2018 and rolled out of Isphani Hangar by the method of decals to make a debut at the New Islamabad International Airport.&#91;89&#93;&#91;90&#93; The re-branding was halted on Suo Moto Notice taken by Supreme Court of Pakistan on fears of spending millions on the rebranding and not paying the salary of the staff on time. The Supreme Court of Pakistan suo motu notice barred PIA from using the Markhor logo as its brand identity. Supreme Court later gave orders to retain the flag on the tail and disposed off the case. However, with management change, the re-branding was abandoned altogether.&#91;91&#93;&#91;92&#93; Currently, the airline is operating a hybrid livery which features a euro-white fuselage and gold Urdu logo in-front of the front exits and engine cowling while the flag tail, English PIA (and Pakistan International in gold) titles in dark green and Pakistan titles in dark green on the belly have been retained from the 2010 livery. The PIA corporate website was also added ahead of the aft exits. Currently, five Boeing 777s and three A320s are sporting this livery.
PIA operates a three-class configuration on its domestic routes: Business, Executive Economy and Economy. On international flights, a two-class configuration (Executive Economy and Economy class) has been introduced since January 2019. PIA has retained Business class-only on domestic flights operated by Boeing 777s. PIA Business and Executive Economy passengers are offered recliner seats on all Boeing 777 aircraft. Seats with more legroom and vacant middle seat are offered in Executive Economy on board the Airbus A320 aircraft. In Economy class, all passengers on the Boeing 777 are offered seats with 30-inch legroom and personal entertainment screens in a 3-3-3 configuration. On the Airbus A320, fabric-covered seats in a 3–3 configuration are offered.
PIA Catering is the main supplier of meals for the airline at Islamabad and Karachi. It can produce 15,000 passenger meals each day. In 2006, the management of the flight kitchens was given to Singapore Air Terminal Services (SATS). This agreement ended in 2011 and PIA is managing the Flight Kitchens in Karachi and Islamabad itself. As of April 2019, an MOU was signed between PIA and McDonald's for the airlines catering. PIA Catering provides special meals to allow for passengers' dietary and religious needs. No alcoholic beverages and pork are served on board due to Islamic law.&#91;93&#93;
PIA Premier was launched as a luxury air service on 14 August 2016. An Airbus A330 aircraft was initially wet-leased from SriLankan Airlines to operate the service.&#91;54&#93; There were six weekly flights to London, three each from Islamabad and Lahore.&#91;94&#93; PIA ended the service due to losses and the A330 was returned to SriLankan.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The PIA in-flight magazine, Humsafar (Urdu for "travel companion"), is provided to all passengers on all flights. Humsafar was introduced in 1980 and is printed and published bi-monthly.
Pakistan International Airlines was the first international airline to introduce entertainment system showing a regularly scheduled film on board in the year 1962.&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93; Up to date, most of PIA's long haul fleet in-flight entertainment is currently unusable and the system went haywire. PIA is currently repairing it.
In January 2017, the airline began trials on an on-board internet system to deliver in-flight entertainment on some domestic flights. The system allows passengers to access a selection of in-flight entertainment content using their own mobile devices.&#91;97&#93; PIA offers personal screens on Boeing 777 flights with in-flight movies, music and TV shows. The Boeing 777 IFE also features an inflight map and air show. Selected A320s feature drop-down screens with in-flight map and air-show.
PIA Awards Plus+ is the frequent flyer program. The program allows passengers to get free tickets, excess baggage vouchers, cabin upgrades, and a variety of rewards, special deals, and discounts. Awards Plus+ has three tiers of membership – Emerald, Sapphire, and Diamond. Awards Plus+ miles can be earned by flying PIA and by using the products and services of PIA's partners.
The Precision Engineering Complex (PEC) includes the following facilities:
PIA provides ground handling services to the following airlines:
PIA operates a cargo delivery system within Pakistan. PIA Cargo transports goods across Pakistan as well as to international destinations. These include meat and vegetables, textiles, paper products, laboratory equipment and postal mail.
During the early 1970s, PIA operated a service called "Air Express" that delivered documents and parcels within Pakistan. In 1974, PIA launched a dedicated cargo division within its organisation using two Boeing 707-320C. This division was known as "Pakistan International Cargo". The airline operated several cargo flights to the Middle East such as Dubai and Europe especially London. The operations ended in the late 1990s when both aircraft were phased out. During 2004 to 2007, the airline did again operate two Airbus A300 Freighter aircraft chartered through MNG Airlines to Haan. Luton, Amsterdam, Basel and Cologne. However again the contract ended and PIA discontinued this service.
In 2003, the airline launched "PIA Speedex", a courier service in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad initially. This later expanded twelve cities within a year. Today, the airline offers over 70 locations within Pakistan, with shipments collected and delivered from customers homes.
The airline has sponsored events, both within Pakistan and in its overseas markets.
In the 1990s, the airline launched the three green stripe livery to represent its support for sports. The airline supports the Pakistan International Airlines first-class cricket team that plays in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy and Patron's Trophy. PIA sponsors the PIA football club, and the A1 Team Pakistan in the A1 Grand Prix open-wheel auto racing series when it was initially launched. The airline also promotes the Shandur Polo Gala, that takes place every year in the Chitral and Gilgit regions of northern Pakistan during the summer period.&#91;101&#93; PIA also has its own Sports Division since 1958 promoting sports within Pakistan such as cricket, hockey, football, squash, polo, tennis, bridge, chess, table tennis, cycling, and bodybuilding. PIA has its own Boy Scouts Association (PIA-BSA) working in partnership with Pakistan Boy Scouts Association. After a devastating earthquake in 2005, PIA-BSA worked in partnership with other charity organisations to provide relief help.
PIA was one of the official sponsors of the "Destination Pakistan 2007" festivals. The official logo was added to a select number of aircraft during the year&#91;102&#93; In 2008, PIA teamed up with mobile phone provider, Ufone to provide air miles to passengers who used the mobile network. Standard Chartered Bank and PIA launched Credit Cards allowing passengers to earn air miles for use of their credit cards.&#91;103&#93; In 2009, PIA was the gold sponsor for Logistics Pakistan, an Exhibition and Conference poised to highlight the emerging opportunities for the Logistics sector in Pakistan. In 2009, PIA and Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) formed a strategic alliance to promote world money transfers.&#91;104&#93;
PIA has Planetariums in Karachi and Lahore that enable the public to see static aircraft as well as astronomy shows. PIA Horticulture, set up in 1996, provides flowers for display in PIA's offices and events, winning awards and accolades at flower exhibitions across the country. The airline supports non-profit organisations within Pakistan such as Al-Shifa Trust; Zindagi Trust; The Citizens Foundation; and Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT).&#91;105&#93; In 2009, PIA teamed up with the fast-food franchise McDonald's, to offer passengers discounts on meals and upgrades.&#91;106&#93; PIA also owns three hotels, the Roosevelt Hotel, the Scribe Hotel and Skyrooms (Private) Limited.&#91;107&#93; The airline also has an agreement with Pearl Continental Hotels for its UAE based passengers.&#91;108&#93;
PIA operates private charter flights using ATR 42s to Bhit, Kadanwari and Sehwan Sharif in Sindh as well as to other parts of the country for oil and gas companies and other customers. Ad hoc charters for United Nations peacekeeping troops are also carried out to Africa and Eastern Europe, Asia (South Korea, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, East Timor) and many other international destinations; PIA Charter Team provides these services.
PIA operates a two-month (pre- and post-) Hajj operation each year to and from Saudi Arabia. PIA transported over 100,000 intending pilgrims each year to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia until its fleet shrank to 25 aircraft in 2011–2012. Since then, the airline's Hajj quota was reduced to 60,00 to 70,000 pilgrims by the then government.
PIA has been continuously serving government officials of Pakistan and has always transported the President and Prime Minister on overseas visits. During the late 1990s, a PIA Boeing 737-300&#91;109&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93; was used for official visits by the Bhutto and Sharif governments. The aircraft wore official government colours but was later repainted in the airline official colours at the end of the decade. When the government changed after a military coup in 1999, the Boeing 737-300 was transferred to PIA permanently. The President and Prime Minister then resorted to using two of PIA's Airbus A310-300s for official visits, while rare trips were done on regular commercial flights of the airline. In February 2007 the government of Qatar gifted an Airbus A310 from its VIP fleet&#91;110&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93; to the Pakistani government; this ended the need for the use of PIA aircraft. However, from time to time the government uses one of the airline's Airbus A320s, or occasionally a Boeing 777, for official trips.&#91;111&#93;
PIA Township (Urdu: پی آئی اے ٹاؤن شپ&#8206;) also known as PIA Colony is Pakistan International Airlines flat complex which is a major residential gated community located in Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. The township was built for the employees working in PIA. The township has at least 1100 flats. The township is next to the Jinnah International Airport.
Pakistan International Airlines experienced its first recorded hull loss in 1956: a Douglas DC-3 flew into a mountain on 25 February that year while on a cargo flight from Gilgit to Islamabad in poor weather, killing the three crew members on board.&#91;112&#93; Since then the airline has lost more than thirty aircraft in crashes and other events, including another twenty fatal crashes.&#91;113&#93; There have also been at least eight hijacking incidents involving the airline's aircraft between 1971 and 2017.

Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 was a scheduled domestic flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Pakistan. On 22 May 2020, the Airbus A320 crashed in Model Colony, a densely populated residential area of Karachi a few kilometres from the runway, while on a second final approach to Jinnah International Airport, after a failed landing. There were 91 passengers and eight crew on board the aircraft. Ninety-seven of them were killed, while two passengers survived with injuries. Eight people on the ground were also injured, and one of them later died.
The flight, piloted by captain Sajjad Gul and first officer Usman Azam,&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; took off from Lahore shortly after 1:00 ;p.m.&#91;3&#93; and was near the end of its 90-minute journey,&#91;4&#93; when it crashed at around 2:45 ;p.m.(09:45 UTC)&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; into the densely-populated neighbourhood of Model Colony&#91;7&#93; around 3 kilometres (1.9 miles) from the airport.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93; The aircraft's wings were reported as being on fire in the moments before the plane crashed into rooftops.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; The crash damaged buildings in the area,&#91;8&#93; some of which caught fire.&#91;12&#93; The crash was captured on video by a CCTV camera, which shows the aircraft just before crashing into the neighbourhood.&#91;13&#93;
The pilot had made an initial aborted landing attempt.&#91;14&#93;&#91;3&#93; He later radioed air traffic control (ATC) reporting landing gear issues and the failure of both engines.&#91;4&#93; ATC confirmed to the pilot that he was cleared to use either of the airport's two runways, requesting, "Confirm your attempt on belly?"&#91;5&#93;&#91;12&#93; According to PIA's CEO, Arshad Malik, a technical fault prompted the pilot to make a go-around rather than land, even though both runways were available to him.&#91;10&#93; The pilot told the controller, "we are returning back, sir, we have lost engines." Twelve seconds later, he declared a mayday emergency,&#91;3&#93;&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; which was the final communication with the aircraft.&#91;14&#93;
According to officials from Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), complications had arisen during the aircraft's first descent.&#91;17&#93; The landing gear was still in the retracted position when the aircraft attempted its first landing. Friction marks on the runway suggested there had been some ground contact; at the runway's 1,400-metre (4,500 ;ft) mark, the plane's left engine is believed to have scraped the runway, while at the 1,700-metre (5,500 ;ft) mark, the right engine made contact. When the pilot went around, it is believed damage had already been caused to both engines from this contact, leading to engine failure after the go-around. This, in turn, made it impossible for the aircraft to maintain altitude, causing it to crash during its return to the airfield.&#91;17&#93; This is supported by the conversation between the aircraft and air traffic control which indicates that the aircraft was constantly losing altitude.&#91;18&#93; Observers noted that the plane's backup ram air turbine was deployed, the purpose of which is to supply power to the aeroplane's control systems when both engines have failed.&#91;17&#93;
The Economic Times reported that the pilot had ignored warnings from air traffic control about the height and speed of the aircraft on approach. At 2:30 ;pm the plane was 15 nautical miles from Karachi, at Makli, flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet instead of the recommended 7,000 feet, when ATC issued its first warning to reduce altitude. Instead of descending, the pilot responded by saying that he was satisfied with the altitude. When only 10 nautical miles from the airport, the aircraft was at an altitude of 7,000 feet instead of 3,000 feet. ATC issued a second warning to descend. The pilot responded again by stating that he was satisfied and able to handle the situation, and that he was prepared for landing.&#91;19&#93; The pilot had a flying experience of 18,000 flight hours.&#91;20&#93;
The narrow streets and alleys comprising the area inhibited the rescue services.&#91;4&#93; ISPR, the Pakistani military's media wing, reported that special forces of the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Rangers had set up a cordon.&#91;4&#93;&#91;11&#93; Video footage of the crash scene showed emergency teams trying to reach the scene amid the rubble, clouds of black smoke and flames in the background.&#91;12&#93;
Residents said it is not uncommon for aircraft on final approach to pass so close to building rooftops that they "feel ;... we can touch it", given the proximity of the runways. Jinnah Airport is surrounded by urban areas on all sides save for the north side, which leads to a scenario very similar to San Diego or Kai Tak with jets having to pass low over urban buildings before landing on one of the two runways.&#91;21&#93; Edhi Foundation's Faisal Edhi said at least 25 houses suffered damage due to the crash.&#91;11&#93; PIA's spokesman Abdullah Hafiz Khan has said that 18 houses were destroyed or badly damaged.&#91;22&#93; According to a witness statement collected by Reuters, the plane hit a mobile phone tower in the vicinity of the airport as it crashed.&#91;10&#93;
The crashed aircraft was an Airbus A320-214,&#91;23&#93; which was built in 2004 and owned by GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). It made its maiden flight on 17 August 2004 and was leased to China Eastern Airlines as B-6017 between 2004 and 2014. It was then leased to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) by GECAS on 31 October 2014, with registration AP-BLD.&#91;7&#93;&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; It was powered by CFM56-5B4/P engines,&#91;26&#93; which were most recently installed in February and May 2019.&#91;17&#93; The landing gear was installed in October 2014 and was next due for servicing and replacement after 10 years leased.&#91;17&#93;
The PIA's engineering department reported that the last routine maintenance check on the plane was conducted on 21 March 2020, while the most comprehensive check was last performed on 19 October 2019, during which no defects were found in its engines, landing gear or avionics.&#91;26&#93;&#91;17&#93; From 22 March to 7 May 2020, the plane had remained grounded owing to flight cancellations amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. From 7 May onward, the plane had conducted six flights.&#91;17&#93; The Civil Aviation Authority had declared the aircraft fit for flight until 5 November. The plane had operated a flight from Muscat to Lahore on the day prior to the accident.&#91;26&#93; The aircraft had logged 47,124 flight hours.&#91;17&#93;
Pakistan International Airlines released details of the flight manifest which shows 91 passengers (51 men, 31 women, and 9 children); there were also eight crew members.&#91;8&#93;&#91;28&#93;&#91;4&#93;&#91;29&#93;&#91;14&#93;&#91;30&#93; The death toll was confirmed as 97, consisting solely of those on board the plane&#91;10&#93;&#91;31&#93; but later one of those injured on the ground died.&#91;32&#93; One of the passengers was an American citizen.&#91;33&#93; The Pakistani model and actress Zara Abid was one of the flight's passengers.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93; Five officers from the Pakistan Army and one from the Pakistan Air Force were also among the victims.&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93;
Meeran Yousaf, the spokesman of Sindh Health Department, has said eight residents of the Model Colony were injured in the crash and most victims' corpses had suffered burns.&#91;22&#93; Most of the injured were women and children.&#91;22&#93; Faisal Edhi said 25–30 people were hospitalised, mostly due to burns.&#91;38&#93; No one in the colony has been reported to have been killed in the crash,&#91;39&#93; though earlier a hospital had claimed to receive dead bodies of those killed on the ground.&#91;40&#93; Ten days after the accident, one of the injured, a thirteen-year-old girl, died in the hospital due to burn injuries.&#91;41&#93;&#91;32&#93;
DNA testing is being used to identify the victims. As of 1 June 2020, 84 people have been identified, 45 of them through DNA tests, per Sindh's health department.&#91;32&#93; Edhi Foundation has reported about 19 bodies being taken away by relatives by force from its morgue, without providing proof to establish identity or waiting for identification through DNA testing.&#91;42&#93;
The Sindh Minister of Health and Population Welfare declared a state of emergency for Karachi's hospitals, while Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered all available resources to the crash site, as did the chief of staff of the Pakistan Air Force.&#91;10&#93; Khan also announced an inquiry,&#91;43&#93; while PIA was reported to have shut down its website.&#91;44&#93; The President, Arif Alvi, tweeted his condolences.&#91;12&#93; Public figures across Pakistan expressed their sadness and shock at the incident.&#91;45&#93; Many international leaders and celebrities also sent their condolences.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;
Pakistan had allowed domestic flights to resume, following suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, six days earlier on 16 May.&#91;4&#93;&#91;note 1&#93; Since the crash occurred during the last days of Ramadan, many people were expected to travel to celebrate Eid al-Fitr with their families.&#91;5&#93; The pandemic had already stretched the healthcare resources of the city and the crash intensified the burden. Consequently, one of the two survivors was moved to a public hospital in the city centre instead of hospitals closer to the crash site.&#91;44&#93;
The government announced a compensation of ₨ ;1 ;million (₨ 10 ;lakh, US$6,250) each for the families of those killed, and ₨ ;500,000 (₨ 5 lakh, US$3,125) each for the two survivors.&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93;
Airbus, the aircraft's manufacturer, announced that they will be providing assistance to the investigation.&#91;28&#93;&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93; Subsequently, an 11-member Airbus team visited the crash site on 26 May.&#91;53&#93; Following the crash, the flight data recorder (FDR) was found on 23 May. PIA's spokesman Abdullah Khan said that the black box would be handed over to the inquiry board and claimed that both the FDR and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) had been recovered.&#91;54&#93; Abdullah Khan announced its recovery from the debris on 28 May.&#91;55&#93; Both are to be given to the Airbus investigation team which will take it to France for decoding.&#91;56&#93;
Ghulam Sarwar Khan, the federal minister for the Aviation Division, said that the full results of the inquiry would be made available within three months.&#91;57&#93; A preliminary investigation report, published by the CAA, was reported to have said that the engines had scraped the runway three times on the pilot's first attempt to land, causing friction and sparks. The contacts with the runway may have caused possible damage to the engines' oil tank and fuel pump.&#91;58&#93;

Karachi (Urdu: کراچی&#8206;; Sindhi: ڪراچي; ALA-LC: Karācī, IPA: ;[kəˈraːtʃi]&#32;(listen)) is the capital of the Pakistani province of Sindh. It is the largest city in Pakistan,&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; and seventh largest city proper in the world.&#91;16&#93; Ranked as a beta-global city,&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; the city is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,&#91;19&#93; with an estimated GDP of $114 ;billion (PPP) as of 2014.&#91;12&#93;&#91;13&#93; Karachi is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, its most linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse city,&#91;20&#93; as well as one of Pakistan's most secular and socially liberal cities.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; With its location on the Arabian Sea, Karachi serves as a transport hub, and is home to Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Bin Qasim, as well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.
Though the Karachi region has been inhabited for millennia,&#91;24&#93; the city was founded as the fortified village of Kolachi in 1729.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; The settlement drastically increased in importance with the arrival of British East India Company in the mid 19th century. The British embarked on major works to transform the city into a major seaport, and connected it with their extensive railway network.&#91;26&#93; By the time of the Partition of British India, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000.&#91;20&#93; Following the independence of Pakistan, the city's population increased dramatically with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from India.&#91;27&#93; The city experienced rapid economic growth following independence, attracting migrants from throughout Pakistan and South Asia.&#91;28&#93; Karachi's total population was enumerated at 16,051,521 and urban population was 14.9 ;million in the 2017 census. Karachi is one of the world's fastest growing cities,&#91;29&#93; and has communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi is home to more than two million Bangladeshi immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar.&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93;&#91;32&#93;
Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $114 ;billion as of 2014&#91;update&#93; which is the largest in Pakistan.&#91;33&#93;&#91;12&#93; Karachi collects more than a third of Pakistan's tax revenue,&#91;34&#93; and generates approximately 20% of Pakistan's GDP.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; Approximately 30% of Pakistani industrial output is from Karachi,&#91;37&#93; while Karachi's ports handle approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.&#91;38&#93; Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.&#91;38&#93; Karachi is considered to be Pakistan's fashion capital,&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week since 2009.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93;
Known as the "City of Lights" in the 1960s and 1970s for its vibrant nightlife,&#91;43&#93; Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic, sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the arrival of weaponry during the Soviet–Afghan War.&#91;44&#93; The city had become well known for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes sharply decreased following a controversial crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM political party, and Islamist militants initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.&#91;45&#93; As a result of the operation, Karachi went from being ranked the world's 6th most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to 93rd by early 2020.&#91;46&#93;
Modern Karachi was reputedly founded in 1729 as the settlement of Kolachi-jo-Goth.&#91;25&#93; The new settlement is said to have been named in honour of Mai Kolachi, whose son is said to have slain a man-eating crocodile in the village after his elder brothers had already been killed by it.&#91;25&#93; The name Karachee, a shortened and corrupted version the original name Kolachi-jo-Goth, was used for the first time in a Dutch report from 1742 about a shipwreck near the settlement.&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93;
The region around Karachi has been the site of human habitation for millennia. Late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic sites have been excavated in the Mulri Hills along Karachi's northern outskirts. These earliest inhabitants are believed to have been hunter-gatherers, with ancient flint tools discovered at several sites.
The expansive Karachi region is believed to have been known to the Ancient Greeks, and may have been the site of Barbarikon, an ancient seaport which was located at the nearby mouth of the Indus River.&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93;&#91;51&#93;&#91;52&#93; Karachi may also have been referred to as Ramya in ancient Greek texts.&#91;53&#93; The ancient site of Krokola, a natural harbor west of the Indus where Alexander the Great sailed his a fleet for Babylonia, may have been located near the mouth of Karachi's Malir River,&#91;54&#93;&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93; though some believe it was located near Gizri Creek.&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93; No other natural harbor exists near the mouth of the Indus that could accommodate a large fleet.&#91;59&#93; Nearchus, who commanded Alexander's naval fleet, also mentioned a hilly island by the name of Morontobara and an adjacent flat island named Bibakta, which colonial historians identified as Karachi's Manora Point and Kiamari (or Clifton), respectively, based on Greek descriptions.&#91;60&#93;&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93; Both areas were island until well into the colonial era, when silting in led to them being connected to the mainland.&#91;63&#93;
In 711 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Indus Valley and the port of Debal, from where Muhammad Bin Qasim launched his forces further into the Indus valley in 712 CE.&#91;64&#93; Some have identified the port with Karachi, though some argue the location was somewhere between Karachi and the nearby city of Thatta.&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93;
Under Mirza Ghazi Beg, the Mughal administrator of Sindh, the development of coastal Sindh and the Indus delta was encouraged. Under his rule, fortifications in the region acted as a bulwark against Portuguese incursions into Sindh. In 1553–54, Ottoman admiral, Seydi Ali Reis, mentioned a small port along the Sindh coast by the name of Kaurashi which may have been Karachi.&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93;&#91;69&#93; The Chaukhandi tombs in Karachi's modern suburbs were built around this time between the 15th and 18th centuries.
19th century Karachi historian Seth Naomal Hotchand recorded that a small settlement of 20–25 huts existed along the Karachi Harbour that was known as Dibro, which was situated along a pool of water known as Kolachi-jo-Kun.&#91;70&#93; In 1725, a band of Balochi settlers from Makran and Kalat had settled in the hamlet after fleeing droughts and tribal feuds.&#91;71&#93;
A new settlement was built in 1729 at the site of Dibro, which came to be known as Kolachi-jo-Goth ("The village of Kolachi").&#91;25&#93; The new settlement is said to have been named in honour of Mai Kolachi, a resident of the old settlement whose son is said to have slain a man-eating crocodile.&#91;25&#93; Kolachi was about 40 hectares in size, with some smaller fishing villages scattered in its vicinity.&#91;72&#93; The founders of the new fortified settlement were Sindhi Baniyas,&#91;71&#93; and are said to arrived from the nearby town of Kharak Bandar after the harbour there silted in 1728 after heavy rains.&#91;73&#93; Kolachi was fortified, and defended with cannons imported from Muscat, Oman. Under the Talpurs, the Rah-i-Bandar road was built to connect the city's port to the caravan terminals.&#91;74&#93; This road would eventually be further developed by the British into Bandar Road, which was renamed Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road.&#91;75&#93;&#91;76&#93;
The name Karachee was used for the first time in a Dutch document from 1742, in which a merchant ship de Ridderkerk is shipwrecked near the settlement.&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93; In 1770, Karachi came under the control of the Khan of Kalat, which attracted a second wave of Balochi settlers.&#91;71&#93; In 1795, Karachi was annexed by the Talpurs, triggering a third wave of Balochi settlers who arrived from interior Sindh and southern Punjab.&#91;71&#93; The Talpurs built the Manora Fort in 1797,&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93; which was used to protect Karachi's Harbor from al-Qasimi pirates.&#91;79&#93;
In 1799 or 1800, the founder of the Talpur dynasty, Mir Fateh Ali Khan, allowed the East India Company under Nathan Crow to establish a trading post in Karachi.&#91;80&#93; He was allowed to build a house for himself in Karachi at that time, but by 1802 was ordered to leave the city.&#91;81&#93; The city continued to be ruled by the Talpurs until it was occupied by forces under the command of John Keane in February 1839.&#91;82&#93;
The British East India Company captured Karachi on 3 ;February 1839 after HMS ;Wellesley opened fire and quickly destroyed Manora Fort, which guarded Karachi Harbour at Manora Point.&#91;83&#93; Karachi's population at the time was an estimated 8,000 to 14,000,&#91;84&#93; and was confined to the walled city in Mithadar, with suburbs in what is now the Serai Quarter.&#91;85&#93; British troops, known as the "Company Bahadur" established a camp to the east of the captured city, which became the precursor to the modern Karachi Cantonment. The British further developed the Karachi Cantonment as a military garrison to aid the British war effort in the First Anglo-Afghan War.&#91;86&#93;
Sindh's capital was shifted from Hyderabad to Karachi in 1840 until 1843, when Karachi was annexed to the British Empire after Major General Charles James Napier captured the rest of Sindh following his victory against the Talpurs at the Battle of Miani. Following the 1843 annexation, the entire province was amalgamated into the Bombay Presidency for the next 93 years. A few years later in 1846, Karachi suffered a large cholera outbreak, which led to the establishment of the Karachi Cholera Board (predecessor to the city's civic government).&#91;87&#93;
The city grew under the administration of its new Commissioner, Henry Bartle Edward Frere, who was appointed in 1850. Karachi was recognized for its strategic importance, prompting the British to establish the Port of Karachi in 1854. Karachi rapidly became a transportation hub for British India owing to newly built port and rail infrastructure, as well as the increase in agricultural exports from the opening of productive tracts of newly irrigated land in Punjab and interior Sindh.&#91;88&#93; By 1856, the value of goods traded through Karachi reached ₤855,103, leading to the establishment of merchant offices and warehouses.&#91;89&#93; The population in 1856 is estimated to have been 57,000.&#91;90&#93; During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the 21st Native Infantry, then stationed in Karachi, mutinied and declared allegiance to rebel forces in September 1857, though the British were able to quickly defeat the rebels and reassert control over the city.
Following the Rebellion, British colonial administrators continued to develop the city's infrastructure, but continued to neglect localities like Lyari, which was home to the city's original population of Sindhi fishermen and Balochi nomads.&#91;91&#93; At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Karachi's port became an important cotton-exporting port,&#91;90&#93; with Indus Steam Flotilla and Orient Inland Steam Navigation Company established to transport cotton from interior Sindh to Karachi's port, and onwards to textile mills in England.&#91;92&#93; With increased economic opportunities, economic migrants from several ethnicities and religions, including Anglo-British, Parsis, Marathis, and Goan Christians, among others, established themselves in Karachi,&#91;90&#93; with many setting-up businesses in the new commercial district of Saddar. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was born in Karachi's Wazir Mansion in 1876 to such migrants from Gujarat. Public building works were undertaken at this time in Gothic and Indo-Saracenic styles, including the construction of Frere Hall in 1865 and the later Empress Market in 1889.
With the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Karachi's position as a major port increased even further.&#91;90&#93; In 1878, the British Raj connected Karachi with the network of British India's vast railway system. In 1887, Karachi Port underwent radical improvements with connection to the railways, along with expansion and dredging of the port, and construction of a breakwater.&#91;90&#93; Karachi's first synagogue was established in 1893.&#91;93&#93; By 1899, Karachi had become the largest wheat-exporting port in the East.&#91;94&#93; In 1901, Karachi's population was 117,000 with a further 109,000 included in the Municipal area.&#91;90&#93;
Under the British, the city's municipal government was established. Known as the Father of Modern Karachi, mayor Seth Harchandrai Vishandas led the municipal government to improve sanitary conditions in the Old City, as well as major infrastructure works in the New Town after his election in 1911.&#91;2&#93; in 1914, Karachi had become the largest wheat-exporting port of the entire British Empire,&#91;95&#93; after large irrigation works in interior Sindh were initiated to increase wheat and cotton yields.&#91;90&#93; By 1924, the Drigh Road Aerodrome was established,&#91;90&#93; now the Faisal Air Force Base.
Karachi's increasing importance as a cosmopolitan transportation hub lead to the influence of non-Sindhis in Sindh's administration. Half the city was born outside of Karachi by as early as 1921.&#91;96&#93; Native Sindhis were upset by this influence,&#91;90&#93; and so 1936, Sindh was re-established as a province separate from the Bombay Presidency with Karachi was once again made capital of Sindh. In 1941, the population of the city had risen to 387,000.&#91;90&#93;
At the dawn of independence following the success of the Pakistan Movement in 1947, Karachi was Sindh's largest city with a population of over 400,000.&#91;20&#93; Partition resulted in the exodus of much of the city's Hindu population, though Karachi, like most of Sindh, remained relatively peaceful compared to cities in Punjab.&#91;97&#93; Riots erupted on 6 ;January 1948, after which most of Sindh's Hindu population left for India,&#91;97&#93; with assistance of the Indian government.&#91;98&#93;
Karachi became the focus for the resettlement of middle-class Muslim Muhajir refugees who fled India, with 470,000 refugees in Karachi by May 1948,&#91;99&#93; leading to a drastic alteration of the city's demography. In 1941, Muslims were 42% of Karachi's population, but by 1951 made up 96% of the city's population.&#91;96&#93; The city's population had tripled between 1941 and 1951.&#91;96&#93; Urdu replaced Sindhi as Karachi's most widely spoken language; Sindhi was the mother tongue of 51% of Karachi in 1941, but only 8.5% in 1951, while Urdu grew to become the mother tongue of 51% of Karachi's population.&#91;96&#93; 100,000 Muhajir refugees arrived annually in Karachi until 1952.&#91;96&#93;
Karachi was selected as the first capital of Pakistan, and was administered as a federal district separate from Sindh beginning in 1948,&#91;99&#93; until the capital was shifted to Rawalpindi in 1958.&#91;100&#93; While foreign embassies shifted away from Karachi, the city is host to numerous consulates and honorary consulates.&#91;101&#93; Between 1958 and 1970, Karachi's role as capital of Sindh was ceased due to the One Unit programme enacted by President Iskander Mirza.&#91;2&#93;
Karachi of the 1960s was regarded as an economic role model around the world, with Seoul, South Korea, borrowing from the city's second "Five-Year Plan".&#91;102&#93;&#91;103&#93; Several examples of Modernist architect were built in Karachi during this period, including the Mazar-e-Quaid mausoleum, the distinct Masjid-e-Tooba, and the Habib Bank Plaza (the tallest building in all of South Asia at the time). The city's population by 1961 had grown 369% compared to 1941.&#91;96&#93; By the mid 1960s, Karachi began to attract large numbers of Pashtun and Punjabis from northern Pakistan.&#91;96&#93;
The 1970s saw a construction boom funded by remittances and investments from the Gulf States, and the appearance of apartment buildings in the city.&#91;104&#93; Real-estate prices soared during this period, leading to a worsening housing crisis.&#91;105&#93; The period also saw labour unrest in Karachi's industrial estates beginning in 1970 that were violently repressed by the government of President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto from 1972 onwards.&#91;106&#93; To appease conservative forces, Bhutto banned alcohol in Pakistan, and cracked-down of Karachi's discotheques and cabarets - leading to the closure of Karachi's once-lively nightlife.&#91;107&#93; The city's art scene was further repressed during the rule of dictator General Zia-ul-Haq.&#91;107&#93; Zia's Islamization policies lead the Westernized upper-middle classes of Karachi to largely withdraw from the public sphere, and instead form their own social venues that became inaccessible to the poor.&#91;107&#93;
The 1980s and 1990s saw an influx of almost one million Afghan refugees into Karachi fleeing the Soviet–Afghan War;&#91;96&#93; who were in turn followed in smaller numbers by refugees escaping from post-revolution Iran.&#91;108&#93; At this time, Karachi was also rocked by political conflict, while crime rates drastically increased with the arrival of weaponry from the War in Afghanistan.&#91;44&#93; Conflict between the MQM party, and ethnic Sindhis, Pashtuns, and Punjabis was sharp.&#91;109&#93; The party and its vast network of supporters were targeted by Pakistani security forces as part of the controversial Operation Clean-up in 1992 ;&#8211;&#32;an effort to restore peace in the city that lasted until 1994.&#91;110&#93; Anti-Hindu riots also broke out in Karachi in 1992 in retaliation for the demolition of the Babri Mosque in India by a group of Hindu nationalists earlier that year.&#91;111&#93;
The 2010s saw another influx of hundreds of thousands of Pashtun refugees fleeing conflict in North-West Pakistan and the 2010 Pakistan floods.&#91;96&#93; By this point Karachi had become widely known for its high rates of violent crime, usually in relation to criminal activity, gang-warfare, sectarian violence, and extra-judicial killings.&#91;91&#93; Recorded crimes sharply decreased following a controversial crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM party, and Islamist militants initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.&#91;45&#93; As a result of the operation, Karachi went from being ranked the world's 6th most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to 93rd by early 2020.&#91;46&#93;
Karachi is located on the coastline of Sindh province in southern Pakistan, along a natural harbour on the Arabian Sea. Karachi is built on a coastal plain with scattered rocky outcroppings, hills and marshlands. Mangrove forests grow in the brackish waters around the Karachi Harbour, and farther southeast towards the expansive Indus River Delta. West of Karachi city is the Cape Monze, locally known as Ras Muari, which is an area characterised by sea cliffs, rocky sandstone promontories and undeveloped beaches.
Within the city of Karachi are two small ranges: the Khasa Hills and Mulri Hills, which lie in the northwest and act as a barrier between North Nazimabad and Orangi.&#91;112&#93; Karachi's hills are barren and are part of the larger Kirthar Range, and have a maximum elevation of 528 metres (1,732 feet).
Between the hills are wide coastal plains interspersed with dry river beds and water channels. Karachi has developed around the Malir River and Lyari Rivers, with the Lyari shore being the site of the settlement for Kolachi. To the west of Karachi lies the Indus River flood plain.&#91;113&#93;
Karachi has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) dominated by a long "Summer Season" while moderated by oceanic influence from the Arabian Sea. The city has low annual average precipitation levels (approx. 250 ;mm (10 ;in) per annum), the bulk of which occurs during the July–August monsoon season. While the summers are hot and humid, cool sea breezes typically provide relief during hot summer months, though Karachi is prone to deadly heat waves,&#91;114&#93; though a text message-based early warning system is now in place which helped prevent any fatalities during an unusually strong heatwave in October 2017.&#91;115&#93; The winter climate is dry and lasts between December and February. It is dry and pleasant relative to the warm hot season, which starts in March and lasts until monsoons arrive in June. Proximity to the sea maintains humidity levels at near-constant levels year-round.
The city first developed around the Karachi Harbour, and owes much of its growth to its role as a seaport at the end of the 18th century,&#91;121&#93; contrasted with Pakistan's millennia-old cities such as Lahore, Multan, and Peshawar. Karachi's Mithadar neighbourhood represents the extent of Kolachi prior to British rule.
Karachi is Pakistan's financial and commercial capital.&#91;123&#93; Since Pakistan's independence, Karachi has been the centre of the nation's economy, and remain's Pakistan's largest urban economy despite the economic stagnation caused by sociopolitical unrest during the late 1980s and 1990s. The city forms the centre of an economic corridor stretching from Karachi to nearby Hyderabad, and Thatta.&#91;124&#93;
As of 2014&#91;update&#93;, Karachi had an estimated GDP (PPP) of $114 ;billion.&#91;13&#93;&#91;12&#93; As of 2008&#91;update&#93;, the city's gross domestic product (GDP) by purchasing power parity (PPP) was estimated at $78 ;billion with a projected average growth rate of 5.5 percent.&#91;13&#93;&#91;12&#93; Karachi contributes the bulk of Sindh's gross domestic product.&#91;125&#93;&#91;126&#93;&#91;127&#93;&#91;128&#93; and accounts for approximately 20% of the total GDP of Pakistan.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; The city has a large informal economy which is not typically reflected in GDP estimates.&#91;129&#93; The informal economy may constitute up to 36% of Pakistan's total economy, versus 22% of India's economy, and 13% of the Chinese economy.&#91;130&#93; The informal sector employs up to 70% of the city's workforce.&#91;131&#93; In 2018 The Global Metro Monitor Report ranked Karachi's economy as the best performing metropolitan economy in Pakistan.&#91;132&#93;
Today along with Pakistan's continued economic expansion Karachi is now ranked third in the world for consumer expenditure growth with its market anticipated to increase by 6.6% in real terms in 2018&#91;133&#93; It is also ranked among the top cities in the world by anticipated increase of number of households (1.3 ;million households) with annual income above $20,000 dollars measured at PPP exchange rates by year 2025.&#91;134&#93; The Global FDI Intelligence Report 2017/2018 published by Financial Times ranks Karachi amongst the top 10 Asia pacific cities of the future for FDI strategy.&#91;135&#93;
Most of Pakistan's public and private banks are headquartered on Karachi's I. I. Chundrigar Road, which is known as "Pakistan's Wall Street",&#91;2&#93; with a large percentage of the cashflow in the Pakistani economy taking place on I. I. Chundrigar Road. Most major foreign multinational corporations operating in Pakistan have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also home to the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which was rated as Asia's best performing stock market in 2015 on the heels of Pakistan's upgrade to emerging-market status by MSCI.&#91;136&#93;
Industry contributes a large portion of Karachi's economy, with the city home to several of Pakistan's largest companies dealing in textiles, cement, steel, heavy machinery, chemicals, and food products.&#91;141&#93; The city is home to approximately 30 percent of Pakistan's manufacturing sector,&#91;37&#93; and produces approximately 42 percent of Pakistan's value added in large scale manufacturing.&#91;142&#93; At least 4500 industrial units form Karachi's formal industrial economy.&#91;143&#93; Karachi's informal manufacturing sector employs far more people than the formal sector, though proxy data suggest that the capital employed and value added from such informal enterprises is far smaller than that of formal sector enterprises.&#91;144&#93; An estimated 63% of the Karachi's workforce is employed in trade and manufacturing.&#91;124&#93;
Karachi Export Processing Zone, SITE, Korangi, Northern Bypass Industrial Zone, Bin Qasim and North Karachi serve as large industrial estates in Karachi.&#91;145&#93; The Karachi Expo Centre also complements Karachi's industrial economy by hosting regional and international exhibitions.&#91;146&#93;
As home to Pakistan's largest ports and a large portion of its manufacturing base, Karachi contributes a large share of Pakistan's collected tax revenue. As most of Pakistan's large multinational corporations are based in Karachi, income taxes are paid in the city even though income may be generated from other parts of the country.&#91;158&#93; As home to the country's two largest ports, Pakistani customs officials collect the bulk of federal duty and tariffs at Karachi's ports, even if those imports are destined for one of Pakistan's other provinces.&#91;159&#93; Approximately 25% of Pakistan's national revenue is generated in Karachi.&#91;35&#93;
According to the Federal Board of Revenue's 2006–2007 year book, tax and customs units in Karachi were responsible for 46.75% of direct taxes, 33.65% of federal excise tax, and 23.38% of domestic sales tax.&#91;160&#93; Karachi accounts for 75.14% of customs duty and 79% of sales tax on imports,&#91;160&#93; and collects 53.38% of the total collections of the Federal Board of Revenue, of which 53.33% are customs duty and sales tax on imports.&#91;160&#93;&#91;161&#93;
Karachi is the most linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse city in Pakistan.&#91;20&#93; The city is a melting pot of ethno-linguistic groups from throughout Pakistan, as well as migrants from other parts of Asia. The city's inhabitants are referred to by the demonym Karachiite. The 2017 census numerated Karachi's population to be 14,910,352, having grown 2.49% per year since the 1998 census, which had listed Karachi's population at approximately 9.3 ;million.&#91;162&#93; The city's inhabitants are referred to by the demonym Karachiite in English, and Karāchīwālā in Urdu.
At the end of the 19th century, Karachi had an estimated population of 105,000.&#91;163&#93; By the dawn of Pakistan's independence in 1947, the city had an estimated population of 400,000.&#91;20&#93; The city's population grew dramatically with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from the newly independent Republic of India.&#91;27&#93; Rapid economic growth following independence attracted further migrants from throughout Pakistan and South Asia.&#91;28&#93; The 2017 census numerated Karachi's population to be 14,910,352, having grown 2.49% per year since the 1998 census, which had listed Karachi's population at approximately 9.3 ;million.&#91;162&#93;
Lower than expected population figures from the census suggest that Karachi's poor infrastructure, law and order situation, and weakened economy relative to other parts of Pakistan made the city less attractive to in-migration than previously thought.&#91;162&#93; The figure is disputed by all the major political parties in Sindh.&#91;164&#93;&#91;165&#93;&#91;166&#93; Karachi's population grew by 59.8% since the 1998 census to 14.9 ;million, while Lahore city grew 75.3%&#91;167&#93; ;&#8211;&#32;though Karachi's census district had not been altered by the provincial government since 1998, while Lahore's had been expanded by Punjab's government,&#91;167&#93; leading to some of Karachi's growth to have occurred outside the city's census boundaries.&#91;162&#93; Karachi's population had grown at a rate of 3.49% between the 1981 and 1998 census, leading many analysts to estimate Karachi's 2017 population to be approximately 18 ;million by extrapolating a continued annual growth rate of 3.49%. Some had expected that the city's population to be between 22 and 30 ;million,&#91;162&#93; which would require an annual growth rate accelerating to between 4.6% and 6.33%.&#91;162&#93;
Political parties in the province have suggested the city's population has been underestimated in a deliberate attempt to undermine the political power of the city and province.&#91;168&#93; Senator Taj Haider from the PPP claimed he had official documents revealing the city's population to be 25.6 ;million in 2013,&#91;168&#93; while the Sindh Bureau of Statistics, part of by the PPP-led provincial administration, estimated Karachi's 2016 population to be 19.1 ;million.&#91;169&#93;
The oldest portions of modern Karachi reflect the ethnic composition of the first settlement, with Balochis and Sindhis continuing to make up a large portion of the Lyari neighbourhood,&#91;21&#93; though many of the residents are relatively recent migrants. Following Partition, large numbers of Hindus left Pakistan for the newly-independent Dominion of India (later the Republic of India), while a larger percentage of Muslim migrant and refugees from India settled in Karachi. The city grew 150% during the ten period between 1941 and 1951 with the new arrivals from India,&#91;173&#93; who made up 57% of Karachi's population in 1951.&#91;174&#93; The city is now considered a melting pot of Pakistan, and is the country's most diverse city.&#91;21&#93;
In 2011, an estimated 2.5 ;million foreign migrants lived in the city, mostly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.&#91;175&#93;
Much of Karachi's citizenry descend from Urdu-speaking migrants and refugees from North India who became known by the Arabic term for "Migrant": Muhajir. The first Muhajirs of Karachi arrived in 1946 in the aftermath of the Great Calcutta Killings and subsequent 1946 Bihar riots.&#91;176&#93; The city's wealthy Hindus opposed the resettlement of refugees near their homes, and so many refugees were accommodated in the older and more congested parts of Karachi.&#91;177&#93; The city witnessed a large influx of Muhajirs following Partition, who were drawn to the port city and newly designated federal capital for its white-collar job opportunities.&#91;178&#93; Muhajirs continued to migrate to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and early 1960s,&#91;179&#93; with Karachi remaining the primary destination of Indian Muslim migrants throughout those decades.&#91;180&#93; The Muhajir Urdu-speaking community in the 2017 census forms slightly less than 45% of the city's population.&#91;167&#93; Muhajirs form the bulk of Karachi's middle class.&#91;21&#93; Muhajirs are regarded as the city's most secular community, while other minorities such as Christians and Hindus increasingly regard themselves as part of the Muhajir community.&#91;21&#93;
Karachi is home to a wide array of non-Urdu speaking Muslim peoples from what is now the Republic of India. The city has a sizable community of Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani-speaking refugees.&#91;21&#93; Karachi is also home to a several-thousand member strong community of Malabari Muslims from Kerala in South India.&#91;181&#93; These ethno-linguistic groups are being assimilated in the Urdu-speaking community.&#91;182&#93;
During the period of rapid economic growth in the 1960s, large numbers Pashtuns from the NWFP migrated to Karachi with Afghan Pashtun refugees settling in Karachi during the 80's.&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93;&#91;185&#93;&#91;186&#93;&#91;187&#93; By some estimates, Karachi is home to the world's largest urban Pashtun population,&#91;188&#93; with more Pashtun citizens than the FATA.&#91;2&#93;&#91;188&#93;&#91;188&#93; While generally considered to be one of Karachi's most conservative communities, Pashtuns in Karachi generally vote for the secular Awami National Party rather than religious parties.&#91;2&#93; Pashtuns from Afghanistan are regarded as the most conservative community.&#91;2&#93; Pashtuns from Pakistan's Swat Valley, in contrast, are generally seen as more liberal in social outlook.&#91;2&#93; The Pashtun community forms the bulk of manual labourers and transporters.&#91;189&#93;
Migrants from Punjab began settling in Karachi in large numbers in the 1960s, and now make up an estimated 14% of Karachi's population.&#91;2&#93; The community forms the bulk of the city's police force,&#91;2&#93; and also form a large portion of Karachi's entrepreneurial classes and direct a larger portion of Karachi's service-sector economy.&#91;2&#93; The bulk of Karachi's Christian community, which makes up 2.5% of the city's population, is Punjabi.&#91;190&#93;
Despite being the capital of Sindh province, only 6–8% of the city is Sindhi.&#91;2&#93; Sindhis form much of the municipal and provincial bureaucracy.&#91;2&#93; 4% of Karachi's population speaks Balochi as its mother tongue, though most Baloch speakers are of Sheedi heritage ;&#8211;&#32;a community that traces its roots to Africa.&#91;2&#93;
Following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and independence of Bangladesh, thousands of Urdu-speaking Biharis arrived in the city, preferring to remain Pakistani rather than live in the newly-independent country. Large numbers of Bengalis also migrated from Bangladesh to Karachi during periods of economic growth in the 1980s and 1990s. Karachi is now home to an estimated 2.5 to 3 ;million ethnic Bengalis living in Pakistan.&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93; Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, who speak a dialect of Bengali and are sometimes regarded as Bengalis, also live in the city. Karachi is home to an estimated 400,000 Rohingya residents.&#91;191&#93;&#91;192&#93; Large scale Rohingya migration to Karachi made Karachi one of the largest population centres of Rohingyas in the world outside of Myanmar.&#91;193&#93;
Central Asian migrants from Uzbekistan and Kyrghyzstan have also settled in the city.&#91;194&#93; Domestic workers from the Philippines are employed in Karachi's posh locales, while many of the city's teachers hail from Sri Lanka.&#91;194&#93; Expatriates from China began migrating to Karachi in the 1940s, to work as dentists, chefs and shoemakers, while many of their decedents continue to live in Pakistan.&#91;194&#93;&#91;195&#93; The city is also home to a small number of British and American expatriates.&#91;196&#93;
During World War II, about 3,000 Polish refugees from the Soviet Union, with some Polish families who chose to remain in the city after Partition.&#91;197&#93;&#91;198&#93; Post-Partition Karachi also once had a sizable refugee community from post-revolutionary Iran.&#91;194&#93;
Karachi is one of Pakistan's most religiously diverse cities.&#91;20&#93; Karachiites adhere to numerous sects and sub-sects of Islam, as well as Protestant Christianity, and community of Goan Catholics. The city also is home to large numbers of Hindus, and a small community of Zoroastrians. According to Nichola Khan Karachi is also the world's largest Muslim city.&#91;204&#93;
Prior to Pakistan's independence in 1947, the population of the city was estimated to be 50% Muslim, 40% Hindu, with the remaining 10% primarily Christians (both British and native), with a small numbers of Jews. Following the independence of Pakistan, much of Karachi's Sindhi Hindu population left for India while Muslim refugees from India in turn settled in the city. The city continued to attract migrants from throughout Pakistan, who were overwhelmingly Muslim, and city's population nearly doubled again in the 1950s.&#91;173&#93; As a result of continued migration, over 96.5% of the city currently is estimated to be Muslim.&#91;2&#93;
Karachi is overwhelmingly Muslim,&#91;2&#93; though the city is one of Pakistan's most secular cities.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; Approximately 85% of Karachi's Muslims are Sunnis, while 15% are Shi'ites.&#91;205&#93;&#91;206&#93;&#91;207&#93; Sunnis primarily follow the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, with Sufism influencing religious practices by encouraging reverence for Sufi saints such as Abdullah Shah Ghazi and Mewa Shah. Shi'ites are predominantly Twelver, with a significant Ismaili minority which is further subdivided into Nizaris, Mustaalis, Dawoodi Bohras, and Sulaymanis.
Approximately 2.5% of Karachi's population is Christian.&#91;199&#93;&#91;200&#93;&#91;201&#93; The city's Christian community is primarily composed of Punjabi Christians,&#91;190&#93; who converted from Sikhism to Christianity during the British Raj.&#91;208&#93; Karachi has a community of Goan Catholics who are typically better-educated and more affluent than their Punjabi co-religionists.&#91;209&#93; They established the posh Cincinnatus Town in Garden East as a Goan enclave. The Goan community dates from 1820 and has a population estimated to be 12,000–15,000 strong.&#91;210&#93; Karachi is served by its own archdiocese, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Karachi.
While most of the city's Hindu population left en masse for India following Pakistan's independence, Karachi still has a large Hindu community with an estimated population of 250,000 based on 2013 data,&#91;211&#93; with several active temples in central Karachi. The Hindu community is split into a more affluent Sindhi Hindu and small Punjabi Hindu group that forms part of Karachi's educated middle class, while poorer Hindus of Rajasthani and Marwari descent form the other part and typically serve as menial and day laborers. Wealthier Hindus live primarily in Clifton and Saddar, while poorer ones live and have temples in Narayanpura and Lyari. Many streets in central Karachi still retain Hindu names, especially in Mithadar, Aram Bagh (formerly Ram Bagh), and Saddar.
Karachi's affluent and influential Parsis have lived in the region in the 12th century, though the modern community dates from the mid 19th century when they served as military contractors and commissariat agents to the British.&#91;212&#93; Further waves of Parsi immigrants from Persia settled in the city in the late 19th century.&#91;213&#93; The population of Parsis in Karachi and throughout South Asia is in continuous decline due to low birth-rates and migration to Western countries.&#91;214&#93; According to Framji Minwalla approximately 1,092 Parsis left in Pakistan.&#91;215&#93;
Karachi has the largest number of Urdu speakers in Pakistan.&#91;137&#93; As per the 1998 census, the linguistic breakdown of Karachi Division is:
The category of "others" includes Gujarati, Dawoodi Bohra, Memon, Marwari, Dari, Brahui, Makrani, Hazara, Khowar, Gilgiti, Burushaski, Balti, Arabic, Farsi and Bengali.&#91;218&#93; The number of Sindhi speakers in Karachi is growing as many are moving from rural areas to the city.&#91;219&#93;
Karachi is served by a road network estimated to be approximately 9,500 kilometres (5,900 miles) in length,&#91;220&#93; serving approximately 3.1 ;million vehicles per day.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Karachi is served by three "Signal-Free Corridors" which are designed as urban express roads to permit traffic to transverse large distances without the need to stop at intersections and stop lights.&#91;citation needed&#93; The first opened in 2007 and connects Shah Faisal Town in eastern Karachi to the industrial-estates in SITE Town 10.5 ;km (6 ;1&#8260;2 ;mi) away. The second corridor connects Surjani Town with Shahrah-e-Faisal over a 19-kilometre span, while the third stretch 28 ;km (17 ;1&#8260;2 ;mi) and connects Karachi's urban centre to the Gulistan-e-Johar suburb. A fourth corridor that will link Karachi's centre to Karachi's Malir Town is currently under construction.
Karachi is the terminus of the M-9 motorway, which connects Karachi to Hyderabad. The road is a part of a much larger motorway network under construction as part of the expansive China Pakistan Economic Corridor. From Hyderabad, motorways have been built, or are being constructed, to provide high-speed road access to the northern Pakistani cities of Peshawar and Mansehra 1,100 ;km (700 ;mi) to the north of Karachi.
Karachi is also the terminus of the N-5 National Highway which connects the city to the historic medieval capital of Sindh, Thatta. It offers further connections to northern Pakistan and the Afghan border near Torkham, as well as the N-25 National Highway which connects the port city to the Afghan border near Quetta.
Within the city of Karachi, the Lyari Expressway is a controlled-access highway along the Lyari River in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. As of 8 ;February ;2018&#91;update&#93; Lyari Expressway's north-bound and south-bound sections are both complete and open for traffic.&#91;221&#93; This toll highway is designed to relieve congestion in the city of Karachi. To the north of Karachi lies the Karachi Northern Bypass (M10), which starts near the junction of the M9. It then continues north for a few kilometres before turning west, where it intersects the N25.
Karachi is linked by rail to the rest of the country by Pakistan Railways. The Karachi City Station and Karachi Cantonment Railway Station are the city's two major railway stations.&#91;2&#93; The city has an international rail link, the Thar Express which links Karachi Cantonment Station with Bhagat Ki Kothi station in Jodhpur, India.&#91;222&#93;
The railway system also handles freight linking Karachi port to destinations up-country in northern Pakistan.&#91;223&#93; The city is the terminus for the Main Line-1 Railway which connects Karachi to Peshawar. Pakistan's rail network, including the Main Line-1 Railway is being upgraded as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, allowing trains to depart Karachi and travel on Pakistani railways at an average speed of 160 ;km/h (100 ;mph) versus the average 60 to 105 ;km/h (35 to 65 ;mph) speed currently possible on existing track.&#91;224&#93;
Karachi's public transport infrastructure is inadequate and constrained by low levels of investment.&#91;225&#93; Karachi is not currently served by any municipal public transit, and is instead serviced primarily by the private and informal sector.&#91;226&#93;
Karachi was once served by numerous trams and the Karachi Circular Railway, although both systems are no longer in operation. While the Japanese Government has expressed willingness to help fund the refurbishment of the Karachi Circular Railway,&#91;230&#93; the project has not been finalized.
Karachi's Jinnah International Airport is the busiest airport of Pakistan with a total of 7.2 ;million passengers in 2018.&#91;231&#93; The current terminal structure was built in 1992, and is divided into international and domestic sections. Karachi's airport serves as a hub for the flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), as well as for Air Indus, Serene Air and airblue. The airport offers non-stop flights to destinations throughout East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Persian Gulf States, Europe and North America.&#91;232&#93;&#91;233&#93;
The largest shipping ports in Pakistan are the Port of Karachi and the nearby Port Qasim, the former being the oldest port of Pakistan. Port Qasim is located 35 kilometres (22 miles) east of the Port of Karachi on the Indus River estuary. These ports handle 95% of Pakistan's trade cargo to and from foreign ports. These seaports have modern facilities which include bulk handling, containers and oil terminals.&#91;234&#93;
Karachi has a fragmented system of civic government. The urban area is divided into six District Municipal Corporations: Karachi East, Karachi West, Karachi Central, Karachi South, Malir, Korangi. Each district is further divided into between 22 and 42 Union Committees. Each Union Committee is represented by seven elected representatives, four of whom can be general candidates of any background; the other three seats are reserved for women, religious minorities, and a union representative or peasant farmer.
Karachi's urban area also includes six cantonments, which are administered directly by the Pakistani military, and include some of Karachi's most desirable real-estate.
Key civic bodies, such as the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board and KBCA (Karachi Building Control Authority), among others, are under the direct control of the Government of Sindh.&#91;235&#93; Additionally, Karachi's city-planning authority for undeveloped land, the Karachi Development Authority, is under control of the government, while two new city-planning authorities, the Lyari Development Authority and Malir Development Authority were revived by the Pakistan Peoples Party government in 2011 ;&#8211;&#32;allegedly to patronize their electoral allies and voting banks.&#91;236&#93;
In response to a cholera epidemic in 1846, the Karachi Conservancy Board was organized by British administrators to control its spread.&#91;237&#93;&#91;238&#93; The board became the Karachi Municipal Commission in 1852, and the Karachi Municipal Committee the following year.&#91;237&#93; The City of Karachi Municipal Act of 1933 transformed the city administration into the Karachi Municipal Corporation with a mayor, a deputy mayor and 57 councillors.&#91;237&#93; In 1976, the body became the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.&#91;237&#93;
During the 1900s, Karachi saw its major beautification project under the mayoralty of Harchandrai Vishandas. New roads, parks, residential, and recreational areas were developed as part of this project. In 1948, the Federal Capital Territory of Pakistan was created, comprising approximately 2,103 ;km2 (812 ;sq ;mi) of Karachi and surrounding areas, but this was merged into the province of West Pakistan in 1961.&#91;239&#93; In 1996, the metropolitan area was divided into five districts, each with its own municipal corporation.&#91;237&#93;
In 2001, during the rule of General Pervez Musharraf, five districts of Karachi were merged to form the city district of Karachi, with a three-tier structure. The two most local tiers are composed of 18 towns, and 178 union councils.&#91;240&#93; Each tier focused on elected councils with some common members to provide "vertical linkage" within the federation.&#91;241&#93;
Naimatullah Khan was the first Nazim of Karachi during the Union Council period, while Shafiq-Ur-Rehman Paracha was the first district co-ordination officer of Karachi. Syed Mustafa Kamal was elected City Nazim of Karachi to succeed Naimatullah Khan in 2005 elections, and Nasreen Jalil was elected as the City Naib Nazim.
Each Union Council had thirteen members elected from specified electorates: four men and two women elected directly by the general population; two men and two women elected by peasants and workers; one member for minority communities; two members are elected jointly as the Union Mayor (Nazim) and Deputy Union Mayor (Naib Nazim).&#91;242&#93; Each council included up to three council secretaries and a number of other civil servants. The Union Council system was dismantled in 2011.
In July 2011, city district government of Karachi was reverted its original constituent units known as District Municipal Corporations (DMC). The five original DMCs are: Karachi East, Karachi West, Karachi Central, Karachi South and Malir. In November 2013, a sixth DMC, Korangi District was carved out from District East.&#91;243&#93;&#91;244&#93;&#91;245&#93;&#91;246&#93;&#91;247&#93;
The committees for each district devise and enforce land-use and zoning regulations within their district. Each committee also manages water supply, sewage, and roads (except for 28 main arteries, which are managed by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation).&#91;87&#93; Street lighting, traffic planning, markets regulations, and signage are also under the control of the DMCs. Each DMC are also maintains its own municipal record archive, and devises its own local budget.&#91;87&#93;
Municipal Administration of Karachi is also run by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of main arteries, bridges, drains, several hospitals, beaches, solid waste management, as well as some parks, and the city's firefighting services.&#91;248&#93; The Karachi mayor since 2016 is Waseem Akhtar, with Arshad Hassan serving as Deputy Mayor; both serve as part of the KMC. The Metropolitan Commissioner of the KMC is Dr. Syed Saif-ur-Rehman.&#91;249&#93;
The position of Commissioner of Karachi was created, with Iftikhar Ali Shallwani serving this role.&#91;250&#93; There are six military cantonments, which are administered by the Pakistani Army, and are some of Karachi's most upscale neighbourhoods.
Karachi South
Malir
The Karachi Development Authority (KDA), along with the Lyari Development Authority (LDA) and Malir Development Authority (MDA), is responsible for the development of most undeveloped land around Karachi. KDA came into existence in 1957 with the task of managing land around Karachi, while the LDA and MDA were formed in 1993 and 1994, respectively. KDA under the control of Karachi's local government and mayor in 2001, while the LDA and MDA were abolished. KDA was later placed under direct control of the Government of Sindh in 2011. The LDA and MDA were also revived by the Pakistan Peoples Party government at the time, allegedly to patronize their electoral allies and voting banks.&#91;236&#93; City-planning in Karachi, therefore, is not locally-directed but is instead controlled at the provincial level.
Each District Municipal Corporation regulate land-use in developed areas, while the Sindh Building Control Authority ensures that building construction is in accordance with building &amp; town planning regulations. Cantonment areas, and the Defence Housing Authority are administered and planned by the military.
Municipal water supplies are managed by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KW&amp;SB), which supplies 640 ;million gallons daily (MGD) to the city (excluding the city's steel mills and Port Qasim), of which 440 MGD are filtered/treated.&#91;87&#93; Most of the supply comes from the Indus River, and 90 MGD from the Hub Dam.&#91;87&#93; Karachi's water supply is transported to the city through a complex network of canals, conduits, and siphons, with the aid of pumping and filtration stations.&#91;87&#93; 76% of Karachi households have access to piped water as of 2015&#91;update&#93;,&#91;251&#93; with private water tankers supplying much of the water required in informal settlements.&#91;124&#93; 18% of residents in a 2015 survey rated their water supply as "bad" or "very bad", while 44% expressed concern at the stability of water supply.&#91;251&#93; By 2015, an estimated 30,000 people were dying due to water-borne diseases annually.&#91;252&#93;
The K-IV water project is under development at a cost of $876 ;million. It is expected to supply 650 ;million gallons daily of potable water to the city, the first phase 260 ;million gallons upon completion.&#91;253&#93;&#91;254&#93;
98% of Karachi's households are connected to the city's underground public sewerage system,&#91;251&#93; largely operated by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KW&amp;SB). The KW&amp;SB operates 150 pumping stations, 25 bulk reservoirs, over 10,000 kilometres of pipes, and 250,000 manholes.&#91;87&#93; The city generates approximately 472 ;million gallons daily (MGD) of sewage, of which 417 MGD are discharged without treatment.&#91;87&#93; KW&amp;SB has the optimum capacity to treat up to 150 MGD of sewage, but uses only about 50 MGD of this capacity.&#91;87&#93; Three treatment plants are available, in SITE Town, Mehmoodabad, and Mauripur.&#91;87&#93; 72% reported in 2015 that Karachi's drainage system overflows or backs up,&#91;251&#93; the highest percentage of all major Pakistani cities.&#91;251&#93; Parts of the city's drainage system overflow on average 2–7 times per month, flooding some city streets.&#91;251&#93;
Households in Orangi self-organized to set-up their own sewerage system under the Orangi Pilot Project,&#91;255&#93; a community service organization founded in 1980. 90% of Orangi streets are now connected to a sewer system built by local residents under the Orangi Pilot Project.&#91;255&#93; Residents of individual streets bear the cost of sewerage pipes, and provide volunteer labour to lay the pipe.&#91;255&#93; Residents also maintain the sewer pipes,&#91;255&#93; while the city municipal administration has built several primary and secondary pipes for the network.&#91;255&#93; As a result of OPP, 96% of Orangi residents have access to a latrine.&#91;255&#93;
Karachi's primary education system is divided into five levels: primary (grades one through five); middle (grades six through eight); high (grades nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate); intermediate (grades eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate); and university programs leading to graduate and advanced degrees. Karachi has both public and private educational institutions. Most educational institutions are gender-based, from primary to university level alongside the co education institutions.
Several of Karachi's schools, such as St Patrick's High School, St Joseph's Convent School and St Paul's English High School, are operated by Christian churches, and among Pakistan's most prestigious schools.
Karachi is home to several major public universities. Karachi's first public university's date from the British colonial era. The Sindh Madressatul Islam founded in 1885, was granted university status in 2012. Establishment of the Sindh Madressatul Islam was followed by the establishment of the D. J. Sindh Government Science College in 1887, and the institution was granted university status in 2014. The Nadirshaw Edulji Dinshaw University of Engineering and Technology (NED), was founded in 1921, and is Pakistan's oldest institution of higher learning.

Sometimes stated to be amongst the world's most dangerous cities,&#91;277&#93; the extent of violent crime in Karachi is not as significant in magnitude as compared to other cities.&#91;278&#93; According to the Numbeo Crime Index 2014, Karachi was the 6th most dangerous city in the world. By the middle of 2016, Karachi's rank had dropped to 31 following the launch of anti-crime operations.&#91;279&#93; By 2018, Karachi's ranking has dropped to 50.&#91;280&#93; In mid 2019, Karachi's ranking fell to 71, ranking it safer than regional cities such as Delhi (65th place) and Dhaka (34th place), but was still higher than Mumbai (172nd place) and Lahore (201st place).&#91;281&#93;
The city's large population results in high numbers of homicides with a moderate homicide rate.&#91;278&#93; Karachi's homicide rates are lower than many Latin American cities,&#91;278&#93; and in 2015 was 12.5 per 100,000&#91;282&#93; ;&#8211;&#32;lower than the homicide rate of several American cities such as New Orleans and St. Louis.&#91;283&#93; The homicide rates in some Latin American cities such as Caracas, Venezuela and Acapulco, Mexico are in excess of 100 per 100,000 residents,&#91;283&#93; many times greater than Karachi's homicide rate. In 2016, the number of murders in Karachi had dropped to 471, which had dropped further to 381 in 2017.&#91;284&#93;
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Karachi was rocked by political conflict while crime rates drastically increased with the arrival of weaponry from the War in Afghanistan.&#91;44&#93; Several of Karachi's criminal mafias became powerful during a period in the 1990s described as "the rule of the mafias."&#91;285&#93; Major mafias active in the city included land mafia, water tanker mafia, transport mafia and a sand and gravel mafia.&#91;286&#93;&#91;285&#93;&#91;287&#93;&#91;288&#93; Karachi's highest death rates occurred in the mid 1990s when Karachi was much smaller. In 1995, 1,742 killings were recorded,&#91;289&#93; when the city had over five million fewer residents.&#91;290&#93;
Karachi had become widely known for its high rates of violent crime, but rates sharply decreased following a controversial crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM party, and Islamist militants initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.&#91;45&#93; In 2015, 1,040 Karachiites were killed in either acts of terror or other crime ;&#8211;&#32;an almost 50% decrease from the 2,023 killed in 2014,&#91;291&#93; and an almost 70% decrease from the 3,251 recorded killed in 2013 ;&#8211;&#32;the highest ever recorded number in Karachi history.&#91;292&#93; Despite a sharp decrease in violent crime, street crime remains high.&#91;293&#93;
With 650 homicides in 2015, Karachi's homicide rate decreased by 75% compared to 2013.&#91;294&#93; In 2017, the number of homicides had dropped further to 381.&#91;284&#93; Extortion crimes decreased by 80% between 2013 and 2015, while kidnappings decreased by 90% during the same period.&#91;294&#93; By 2016, the city registered a total of 21 cases of kidnap for ransom.&#91;295&#93; Terrorist incidents dropped by 98% between 2012 and 2017, according to Pakistan's Interior Ministry.&#91;296&#93; As a result of the Karachi's improved security environment, real-estate prices in Karachi rose sharply in 2015,&#91;297&#93; with a rise in business for upmarket restaurants and cafés.&#91;298&#93;
Insufficient affordable housing infrastructure to absorb growth has resulted in the city's diverse migrant populations being largely confined to ethnically homogenous neighbourhoods.&#91;124&#93; The 1970s saw major labour struggles in Karachi's industrial estates. Violence originated in the city's university campuses, and spread into the city.&#91;299&#93; Conflict was especially sharp between MQM party and ethnic Sindhis, Pashtuns, and Punjabis. The party and its vast network of supporters were targeted by Pakistani security forces as part of the controversial Operation Clean-up in 1992, as part of an effort to restore peace in the city that lasted until 1994.&#91;110&#93;
Urban planning and service delivery have not kept pace with Karachi's growth, resulting in the city's low ranking on livability rankings.&#91;124&#93; The city has no cohesive transportation policy, and no official public transit system, though up to 1,000 new cars are added daily to the city's congested streets.&#91;124&#93;

Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture is one of the prime examples of Architectural conservation and restoration where an entire Nusserwanjee building from Kharadar area of Karachi has been relocated to Clifton for adaptive reuse in an art school. The procedure involved the careful removal of each piece of timber and stone, stacked temporarily, loaded on the trucks for transportation to the Clifton site, unloaded and re-arranged according to a given layout, stone by stone, piece by piece, and completed within three months.&#91;305&#93;
Architecturally distinctive, even eccentric, buildings have sprung up throughout Karachi. Notable example of contemporary architecture include the Pakistan State Oil Headquarters building. The city has examples of modern Islamic architecture, including the Aga Khan University hospital, Masjid e Tooba, Faran Mosque, Bait-ul Mukarram Mosque, Quaid's Mausoleum, and the Textile Institute of Pakistan. One of the unique cultural elements of Karachi is that the residences, which are two- or three-story townhouses, are built with the front yard protected by a high brick wall. I. I. Chundrigar Road features a range of extremely tall buildings. The most prominent examples include the Habib Bank Plaza, PRC Towers and the MCB Tower which is the tallest skyscraper in Pakistan.&#91;306&#93;
When it comes to sports Karachi has a distinction, because some sources cite that it was in 1877 at Karachi in (British) India, where the first attempt was made to form a set of rules of badminton&#91;307&#93; and likely place is said to Frere Hall.
Cricket's history in Pakistan predates the creation of the country in 1947. The first ever international cricket match in Karachi was held on 22 November 1935 between Sindh and Australian cricket teams. The match was seen by 5,000 Karachiites.&#91;308&#93; Karachi is also the place that innovated tape ball, a safer and more affordable alternative to cricket.&#91;309&#93;
The inaugural first-class match at the National Stadium was played between Pakistan and India on 26 February 1955 and since then Pakistani national cricket team has won 20 of the 41 Test matches played at the National Stadium.&#91;310&#93; The first One Day International at the National Stadium was against the West Indies on 21 November 1980, with the match going to the last ball.
The national team has been less successful in such limited-overs matches at the ground, including a five-year stint between 1996 and 2001, when they failed to win any matches. The city has been host to a number of domestic cricket teams including Karachi,&#91;311&#93; Karachi Blues,&#91;312&#93; Karachi Greens,&#91;313&#93; and Karachi Whites.&#91;314&#93; The National Stadium hosted two group matches (Pakistan v. South Africa on 29 February and Pakistan v. England on 3 ;March), and a quarter-final match (South Africa v. West Indies on 11 March) during the 1996 Cricket World Cup.&#91;315&#93;
The city has hosted seven editions of the National Games of Pakistan, most recently in 2007.&#91;316&#93;
In 2005, the city hosted the SAFF Championship at this ground, as well as the Geo Super Football League 2007, which attracted capacity crowds during the games. The popularity of golf is increasing, with clubs in Karachi like Dreamworld Resort, Hotel &amp; Golf Club, Arabian Sea Country Club, DA Country &amp; Golf Club. The city has facilities for field hockey (the Hockey Club of Pakistan, UBL Hockey Ground), boxing (KPT Sports Complex), squash (Jahangir Khan Squash Complex), and polo. There are marinas and boating clubs. National Bank of Pakistan Sports Complex is First-class cricket venue and Multi-purpose sports facility in Karachi,

The following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.
A typical entry reports information in the following sequence:

Westley Sissel Unseld (March 14, 1946 – June 2, 2020) was an American professional basketball player, coach and executive. He spent his entire National Basketball Association (NBA) career with the Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets. Unseld played college basketball for the Louisville Cardinals and was selected with the second overall pick by the Bullets in the 1968 NBA draft. He was named the NBA Most Valuable Player during his rookie season and joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only two players in NBA history to accomplish the feat. Unseld won an NBA championship with the Bullets in 1978. After retiring from playing in 1981, he worked with the Bullets/Wizards as a vice president, head coach and general manager.
Unseld was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988 and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;
Unseld starred for the Seneca High School team that won Kentucky state championships in 1963 and 1964. He was recruited by over 100 colleges, including the University of Kentucky. Unseld became the first African-American athlete to be offered an athletic scholarship to the school when Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp attempted to recruit him to the team. Integration leaders in Louisville tried to persuade Unseld to attend the University of Kentucky and stated that "it would be good for Kentucky and the Southeastern Conference."&#91;3&#93; However, he chose to enroll at the University of Louisville in 1965 where he played center for the school's freshman team and averaged 35.8 points and 23.6 rebounds over 14 games. Unseld lettered for Louisville as a sophomore (1965–66), junior (1966–67), and senior (1967–68), scored 1,686 points (20.6 average) and grabbed 1,551 rebounds (18.9 average) over 82 games.&#91;4&#93; He led the Missouri Valley Conference in rebounding all three years.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;
Unseld earned NCAA All-American honors in 1967 and 1968 and led Louisville to a 60–22 record during his collegiate career, making trips to the NIT tournament in 1966 and NCAA tournament in 1967 and 1968. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.&#91;7&#93;
Unseld was selected as the second overall pick by the Baltimore Bullets in the 1968 NBA draft.&#91;8&#93; He was also selected by his hometown Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in the 1968 ABA draft.&#91;9&#93; Unseld was offered contracts by both teams but opted to sign with the Bullets of the more successful NBA despite them allegedly offering less money.&#91;9&#93; After signing Unseld, Bullets owner Earl Foreman proclaimed that "this contract represents the most attractive and rewarding contract that has or will be signed by any player in the NBA this year."&#91;9&#93;
In his first career game, Unseld recorded 8 points and 22 rebounds in a 124–116 Baltimore win over the Detroit Pistons.&#91;10&#93; On October 19, Unseld recorded his first double-double of his career after recording 13 points and 20 rebounds in a 124–121 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.&#91;11&#93; On November 22, Unseld recorded 20 points and a career-high 29 rebounds in a 121–110 loss to the 76ers.&#91;12&#93;
As a rookie, Unseld helped lead the Bullets (which had finished in last place in the Eastern division the previous year) to a 57–25 record and a division title. Unseld averaged 18.2 rebounds per game that year, and joined fellow future Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain to become the second player ever to win the Rookie of the Year Award and the Most Valuable Player Award in the same year.&#91;7&#93; Unseld was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team, and also claimed the Sporting News MVP that year.&#91;13&#93;
Unseld was one of the best defensive players of his era, and in 1975, he led the NBA in rebounding. The following season, he led the NBA in field goal percentage with a .561 percentage.&#91;8&#93;
Unseld took the Bullets franchise to four NBA Finals, and won the championship in 1978 over the Seattle SuperSonics, in which he was named the Finals MVP. He ended his playing career following the 1980–81 season, and his No. 41 jersey was retired by the Bullets shortly thereafter.&#91;14&#93;
Famed for his rebounding, bone-jarring picks and ability to ignite a fast break with his crisp, accurate outlet passes, Unseld made up for his lack of size with brute strength and sheer determination. In 984 NBA games – all with the Bullets – Unseld averaged a double-double in points and rebounds, with averages of 10.8 points and 14.0 rebounds per game. He also averaged 3.9 assists, excellent for a center, in the 36 minutes he played per game. Unseld was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988, and in 1996, he was named as one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players of all time.&#91;15&#93;
After Unseld's retirement in 1981, he moved into a front office position with the Bullets, where he served as vice president for six years before being named head coach in 1988.&#91;16&#93; He resigned following the 1994 season with a 202–345 record (.369).&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; Unseld became the Bullets' general manager in 1996 (they were renamed to the Wizards in 1997) and served in that role for seven years.&#91;19&#93; He guided the team to the playoffs once during his tenure as general manager.&#91;20&#93;
Unseld's wife, Connie, opened Unselds School in 1979. A coed private school located in southwest Baltimore, it has a daycare program, nursery school and a kindergarten-to-eighth grade curriculum. Connie and daughter Kimberley serve as teachers at the school.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93; Unseld worked as an office manager and head basketball coach. He was the godfather of Cleveland Cavaliers all-star forward, Kevin Love, as Kevin's father Stan Love was a teammate of Unseld's on the Baltimore Bullets. His son, Wes Jr., became a basketball coach with the Denver Nuggets.&#91;23&#93;
On June 2, 2020, Unseld's family announced that he had died&#91;14&#93; after suffering lengthy health battles, including most recently with pneumonia.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;

Arrogate (April 11, 2013 ;&#8211;&#32;June 2, 2020) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the 2016 Travers Stakes in a track record in his first stakes appearance. He then won the Breeders' Cup Classic and was named the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and World's Best Racehorse of 2016. To start his four-year-campaign, he won the 2017 Pegasus World Cup in a new track record followed by a win in the Dubai World Cup. On returning to the United States however, he suffered three straight defeats and retired with a record of seven wins from eleven starts. Despite having only four stakes race wins, the large purses for these wins made him the all-time leading money earner in North America.
Arrogate was a gray horse bred in Kentucky by Clearsky Farms. As a yearling, the colt was consigned to the Keeneland September sale and was bought for $560,000 by Juddmonte Farms,&#91;4&#93; the racing operation of Khalid ibn Abdullah. Arrogate was sent into training with Bob Baffert in California. Arrogate's front teeth were knocked back as a yearling, probably after being kicked by another horse. One tooth became infected and was removed, which slowed down his eating but otherwise has no impact.&#91;5&#93;
Arrogate was sired by the Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Unbridled's Song, whose other major winners have included Will Take Charge, the sprinter Zensational and Breeders' Cup winners Unrivaled Belle and Unbridled Elaine.&#91;6&#93; Arrogate's dam Bubbler was a successful racemare who won six of her nine races.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;
Arrogate made his track debut in a six-furlong maiden race at Los Alamitos Race Course on April 17, 2016. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started the odds-on favorite but finished third behind Westbrook and Accelerate. On June 5, he was moved up in distance and recorded his first victory in a maiden race over 1 ;1&#8260;16 miles (1.7 ;km) at Santa Anita Park, leading from the start and winning by two and a half lengths from Giant Expectations. He was partnered in this race by Rafael Bejarano, who rode him in his next two races. Nineteen days later, at the same track, Arrogate contested an allowance race against older horses and won again, beating Fusaichi Samurai by five and a quarter lengths after leading from start. On August 4, the colt appeared in an allowance race at Del Mar and started odd-on favorite against two older opponents. After racing in third place in the early running, he took the lead in the straight and won by one and three quarter lengths.&#91;9&#93;
On August 27, Arrogate was moved up sharply in class to contest the Grade I Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course in which his rivals included Exaggerator and Creator, winners respectively of the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. Bejarano elected to ride another of Baffert's horses, American Freedom, so veteran jockey Mike Smith picked up the ride. Having drawn post position 1 in a large field, Arrogate was ridden hard from the starting gate and set fast opening fractions. As they turned into the stretch, he broke clear of his rivals, eventually winning by thirteen and a half lengths over his stablemate American Freedom, with Creator finishing seventh and Exaggerator eleventh.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93;
His final time of 1:59.36 for the 1 ;1&#8260;4 miles (2.0 ;km) distance eclipsed General Assembly's Travers and track record of 2:00 that had stood for 37 years. Baffert said, "You're always hoping that they're that good. I knew he was good, but I didn't know he was really, really that kind of good."&#91;12&#93;  The horse earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 122 for his effort and became a contender for the year end Eclipse award.&#91;13&#93;
On November 5, Arrogate entered the Breeders' Cup Classic as the second favorite behind 5-year-old California Chrome.  ‘Chrome led from the outset, while Arrogate tracked sitting third.  The two horses engaged in the homestretch and in the final yards, Arrogate surged ahead to defeat California Chrome by a half a length at the finish. The two horses dominated the remainder of the field by over 10 lengths.&#91;14&#93;  Art Sherman said of Arrogate, "That winner is the real McCoy, I knew he was the one we had to beat, but I didn't know how good he was."&#91;15&#93;  Post race analysis gave California Chrome a Beyer Speed Figure of 119, the highest of his career, but Arrogate topped it with a 120.&#91;16&#93;
The race earned Arrogate the top position in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings published by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities on November 10 with a rating of 134, one point ahead of California Chrome.&#91;17&#93; Arrogate was voted the Eclipse Award as American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.&#91;18&#93;
Arrogate was originally scheduled to begin his four-year-old campaign in the San Pasqual Stakes but heavy rains at Santa Anita caused Baffert to scratch from the race.&#91;19&#93; Instead, he trained Arrogate up to the $12 ;million Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park on January 28, 2017. The race was promoted as a final matchup with California Chrome, who was retiring to stud after the race. Both horses were compromised by the post position draw. Arrogate drew post position one and risked getting trapped along the rail in traffic. California Chrome drew the outside post position which caused him to be carried wide in the first turn. California Chrome eventually settled behind the early leaders alongside Arrogate but could not respond when the latter made his move, possibly having wrenched his leg early in the race. California Chrome was eased to prevent the possibility of further injury and finished ninth. Meanwhile, Arrogate swept to the lead and drew off to win by nearly five lengths over longshot Shaman Ghost.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93; The timing of the race proved controversial. The original time, measured by Trakus based on transmitters in the horses' saddlecloths, was 1:47.61. However, clocking experts hand-timed the race almost a second faster, at around 1:46.9. The timing controversy caused the Beyer Speed Figure for Arrogate to be increased from 116 to 119.&#91;22&#93; Gulfstream did a frame-by-frame video analysis and determined the correct time was 1:46.83, a new track record.&#91;23&#93;
Arrogate made his next start on March 25 in the Dubai World Cup at Meydan Racecourse. He broke poorly and was then squeezed between other horses, causing him to drop to the back of the fourteen horse field. Baffert feared the colt had lost all chance but Mike Smith reacted calmly, saying later that he rode him like Zenyatta, who was famous for her closing kick. Once Arrogate recovered his stride, Smith took him to the outside of the field and started to steadily make up ground. When they entered the stretch, Arrogate started to close rapidly and moved by Gun Runner to win by &#x200b;2 ;1&#8260;4 lengths. On a track labeled as muddy, Arrogate completed the 2,000 metres (6,600 ;ft) (roughly 10 furlongs) in 2:02.23. His share of the $10 ;million purse took his career prize-winning to $17,084,600, a North American record. "Everybody who was here tonight is going to say, 'I'm glad I was here to see that,'" said Baffert. "If anybody wasn't super impressed with that, they just don't like horse racing. I still can't believe he won the race."&#91;24&#93;
After returning to the United States, Arrogate was given some time off then was entered in the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar on July 22 where he carried the top weight of 126 pounds. Heavily favored at odds of 1-20, his main rival in a field of five was Accelerate, whose main claim to fame at the time was finishing second ahead of Arrogate in their April 2016 maiden race.&#91;25&#93; However, Arrogate unexpectedly finished fourth, over fifteen lengths behind Accelerate. Mike Watchmaker, a handicapper writing for the Daily Racing Form commented, "He lacked any interest in getting involved in the run to or around the first turn, and the little move he made on the far turn was actually an optical illusion."&#91;26&#93; Another writer called it the biggest upset in the history of Del Mar. "He gallops and works faster than that," said Smith. "I'm dumbfounded."&#91;27&#93;
Arrogate was next entered in the Pacific Classic on August 19, also at Del Mar. Facing off against six other horses, Arrogate stalked the pace set by his stablemate Collected for much of the race, then began to close in on him in the stretch. However, it was not enough to catch Collected, who won by half a length.&#91;28&#93; Following the race, Baffert said it felt "weird" that Collected had won and not Arrogate. "I feel like my older son was beaten by my younger son," he told the Daily Racing Form.&#91;29&#93;
Baffert trained Arrogate up to the 2017 Breeders' Cup Classic on November 4, a layoff of over two months. Arrogate put in several good workouts at his training base in Santa Anita,&#91;30&#93; but handicappers were still concerned about his ability to handle the Del Mar track at which the Classic would be held.&#91;31&#93; Arrogate drew post position one for the race, and Smith announced his intention to be aggressive out of the starting gate in order to avoid being trapped on the rail. Arrogate was made the 2-1 second choice on the morning line behind Gun Runner, who had won three straight Grade I races since returning from Dubai.&#91;32&#93; Unfortunately, Arrogate ducked in at the start and lost ground to the rest of the field. He was never a factor in the race and finished in a dead heat for fifth, 7 1/2 lengths behind Gun Runner.&#91;33&#93;
Smith blamed the loss on Arrogate's dislike for the Del Mar surface. "He just won't run over here. I've tried to talk myself into thinking he would. He has just showed me time and time again that he wouldn't." Baffert said that Arrogate was "like a pitcher who can't find the plate. ... He's just not the horse he was."&#91;33&#93;
Arrogate was retired following the Classic. Juddmonte Farm announced his fee for 2018 would be $75,000.&#91;43&#93;
In the last week of May 2020 Arrogate's stud schedule was suspended when he appeared to be suffering from soreness in his neck. He then fell in his stall, was unable to get back to his feet, and was sent for treatment at the Hagyard Clinic. After four days of  tests and unsuccessful treatment, he was euthanized on June 2. A statement issued by Juddmonte said "His will to fight, so valuable to him on the racetrack, became a challenge in his care. When serious secondary health issues set in, the decision was made to put him to sleep."&#91;44&#93;

Silver Donald Cameron CM&#32;ONS (June 21, 1937 ;&#8211;&#32;June 1, 2020) was a Canadian journalist, author, playwright, and university teacher whose writing focused on social justice, nature, and the environment.&#91;1&#93; His 15 books of non-fiction dealt with everything from history and politics to education and community development.&#91;2&#93; An avid sailor, Cameron wrote several books about ships and the sea. He was the author of a young adult novel and a thriller, both set in Nova Scotia where he lived for more than 40 years.&#91;3&#93; Two of his books, The Education of Everett Richardson (1977 and 2019) and The Living Beach (1998) are included in Atlantic Canada's 100 Greatest Books.&#91;4&#93;
Cameron's only stage play, The Prophet at Tantramar, was about Leon Trotsky's month-long confinement in a prisoner-of-war camp in Amherst, Nova Scotia. That play was also produced as a radio drama, one of more than 50 Cameron wrote for both CBC Radio and CBC Television. In addition, he produced radio and television documentaries. His magazine articles numbered in the hundreds and his newspaper columns appeared in The Globe and Mail and the Halifax Chronicle Herald. He also wrote extensively for provincial and federal government departments as well as for corporate and non-profit clients.&#91;2&#93;&#91;5&#93; One of Cameron's last projects involved a series of interviews with environmental thinkers, writers and activists that appeared as videos on a subscription website called The Green Interview.&#91;6&#93; Interviewees include Vandana Shiva, Farley Mowat, James Lovelock, Jane Goodall and David Orton.&#91;3&#93; Cameron has also written and narrated two documentary films for The Green Interview, Bhutan: The Pursuit of Gross National Happiness (2010)&#91;7&#93; and Salmon Wars: Salmon Farms, Wild Fish and the Future of Communities (2012).&#91;8&#93;
Cameron served as writer-in-residence at two universities in Nova Scotia as well as at the University of Prince Edward Island. He was dean of the School of Community Studies at Cape Breton University and taught at Dalhousie University, the University of British Columbia and the University of New Brunswick.
Donald Cameron was born in 1937 in Toronto, the son of Hazel (Robertson) and Dr. Maxwell A. Cameron.&#91;9&#93; He joked that, at age two, he fled to British Columbia, taking his parents with him.&#91;10&#93; He grew up mostly in Vancouver and attended the University of British Columbia, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1960. He earned his Master of Arts at the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 and returned to UBC to teach for two years before leaving for the University of London, where he received his Ph.D. in 1967.&#91;11&#93; He based his doctoral thesis on his study of the structures in six major novels by Walter Scott. He served as a postdoctoral fellow at Dalhousie University (1967–68) before becoming an English professor in 1968, at the University of New Brunswick.&#91;12&#93;
While teaching at UNB, Cameron served as publisher and founding editor of The Mysterious East.&#91;12&#93; During its four-year existence, the left-leaning, monthly magazine published a wide variety of articles and editorials on issues in Canada's Maritime Provinces, including everything from pollution, housing and censorship to birth control, drugs and the problems of native peoples.&#91;13&#93;
In 1971, Cameron took a leave of absence from UNB and moved to D'Escousse, a village on Isle Madame, a small island off the southeastern coast of Cape Breton. He wanted to write, he missed the sea and his first marriage had ended.&#91;14&#93; He arrived in Cape Breton, a divorced father of three sons and a daughter. As he told a journalist 20 years later, "Dr. Donald Cameron left his university office, drove to the village of D'Escousse, stepped into a phone booth and emerged as the award-winning author and playwright Silver Donald Cameron."&#91;15&#93; (He added the name "Silver" to set himself apart from the multitudes of other Camerons. Folk-singer Tom Gallant suggested the name because Cameron's head of prematurely grey hair was his most striking feature.)&#91;16&#93; Cameron settled in D'Escousse after buying a house he describes as "composed of two tiny ancient buildings pushed together to make one comfortable home." He adds that the house was "spang on the roadside, the floor plan was awkward, and it was half-renovated in a style not much to my taste. But it felt right: a serene and happy little house where generations had loved and laughed and wept and died."&#91;17&#93;
Cameron had already published magazine articles and a literary book, Faces of Leacock, a 1967 study of the great Canadian humorist, but now he was finally free to begin his apprenticeship as a full-time writer.&#91;18&#93; For him, D'Escousse was an ideal home base. "For a writer," Cameron writes, "the great benefit of a village is the way you can know people." He added that in cities, writers are inevitably drawn into limited circles, but villages let them escape. "My friends in D'Escousse include welders, fishermen, millwrights and mothers on welfare as well as teachers, potters, priests and businessmen." Moreover, a writer who lives in a village watches people change and grow. "An electrician becomes a politician, schoolboys become truckers and contractors, middle-aged civil servants retire and old people take their departures. Knowing them year by year, I can grasp something of the flow of their lives."&#91;17&#93;
In 1973, Cameron bought an unfinished boat named Hirondelle in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. In the book Wind, Whales and Whisky, he writes about spending the summer completing it by adding masts, toilets, compasses and handrails before sailing the 33-foot schooner back to D'Escousse. Hirondelle became the first schooner moored in D'Escousse since 1928 when Leonard Pertus sold his own boat Maple Leaf. Pertus became Cameron's tutor and mentor teaching him how to sail safely and well. Cameron dreamed of sailing across the Atlantic and, with the help of friends, began a nine-year project building a 27-foot cutter named Silversark.&#91;17&#93;
In 1977, Silver Donald Cameron published The Education of Everett Richardson: The Nova Scotia Fishermen's Strike 1970–71. Portions of the book had previously appeared in three Canadian magazines, Maclean's, Saturday Night and The Mysterious East.&#91;19&#93;
Everett Richardson was one of 235 trawlermen from the tiny ports of Canso, Mulgrave and Petit de Grat who fought for better pay, safer working conditions, job security and most of all, for the right to belong to the union they had chosen, the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union led by Homer Stevens, a member of the Communist Party of Canada. Their main adversaries were two, huge, foreign-owned fishing companies. The fishermen also faced stiff opposition from what Cameron calls the "cod aristocracy", rich members of the Nova Scotia elite, as well as from leading politicians, judges, government bureaucrats, members of the clergy, the province's main daily newspaper, and the Canadian labour establishment itself. "In the end," Cameron writes, "this is not a story of the fishermen, or even of the labour movement. It is a story about privilege and poverty and injustice in this country, and about the social and political arrangements which cheat and oppress most Canadians, which stunt our humanity and distort our environment."&#91;19&#93;
After a seven-month strike and many more months of struggle, the fishermen eventually lost the right to be represented by their chosen union. However, Cameron points out that they did win collective bargaining rights for fishermen in Nova Scotia breaking centuries-old rules that prohibited them from joining unions. The strike also brought better pay and working conditions. Cameron concludes that the fishermen were both "collective heroes and martyrs, who lost the battle for themselves but won it for their brothers." He adds that the striking fishermen "changed the law, changed conditions on the boats, and left the see-saw of power balanced a little more evenly."&#91;19&#93;
Shortly after the book was published, it received a hostile review in The Globe and Mail. Critic Patrick O'Flaherty complained that the book contributed to a Canadian literary atmosphere that "continues to stink of parlor radical sanctimoniousness."&#91;20&#93; Two years later, critic Michael Greenstein praised the book for its even-handedness, but suggested Cameron got too bogged down in the official account of the strike and could have used more lively anecdotes to entertain his readers.&#91;21&#93; However, more than 30 years after its publication,The Education of Everett Richardson attained the rank of 47th in a volume listing Atlantic Canada's 100 Greatest Books. Authors Trevor Adams and Stephen Clare write: "Cameron takes readers to the strike's seminal moments, giving them a real sense of the people on both sides of the conflict, and showing a keen understanding of this pivotal moment in Canadian labour history." They add that "through the lens of Atlantic Canadian history, or the labour movement, or the history of the fisheries, this is an important book. Yet few books on those subjects stand as large as The Education of Everett Richardson. That's because this book's ultimate strength is in Cameron's storytelling skills. His writing is taut, tense, and blunt, perfectly reflecting the powder-keg feel of the times."&#91;4&#93;
Wind Whales and Whisky: A Cape Breton Voyage recounts Cameron's adventures as he, his wife Lulu and 12-year-old son Mark Patrick sail around Cape Breton Island on their 27-foot cutter Silversark during the summer of 1990. Cameron himself says the book is a family adventure, a portrait of Cape Breton and "an essay on values, what is it that makes a good life."&#91;15&#93; The book has also been described as "a wonderfully entertaining Bruegel painting of a book—at once a travelogue, a history, a geography, a folk study, a social commentary and a book of humour."&#91;22&#93; Cameron introduces his readers to a wide variety of characters that he meets during his voyage including moonshine makers, malt-whisky distillers, musicians, poets, American Buddhists, fishermen and coal miners.&#91;23&#93;
Wind, Whales and Whisky uses the techniques of creative nonfiction blending facts, observations, quotes, dialogue, anecdotes and stories. On a cold day in July, for example, Cameron accompanies Fred Lawrence as he hauls his lobster traps between Money Point and Bay St. Lawrence on the northern tip of Cape Breton Island. The six-page account includes detailed descriptions of how fishermen retrieve, empty and bait their traps, how they determine which lobsters they can legally keep and how they band lobster foreclaws with "a thick, fat elastic" before dropping them into "a bin filled with circulating sea water." The episode contains information on lobster biology including mating and feeding habits as well as what is known about their migrations.&#91;17&#93;
Cameron also describes how businessman John Risley discovered that lobsters "essentially go dormant in icy water" enabling his company to store them for up to a year by putting them into individual plastic trays stacked in "huge racks which reach clear to the ceilings of the cavernous holding rooms" and pumping 24,000 gallons of chilled sea-water per hour through the trays. "At that temperature", Cameron notes, "lobsters do not eat, grow or moult, but they retain their weight, their texture and their taste, drawing only on the nutrients in their blood." He adds that Risley began airlifting his steady supply of lobsters to cities all over the world transforming his company from its beginnings "as a single roadside lobster stand" into "a corporate empire".&#91;17&#93;
The information about lobsters is interwoven with stories about the many shipwrecks on a nearby "killer island", how Fred Lawrence ended up moving to Cape Breton from Maine, and the dramatic traces that "ancient volcanoes, mighty glaciers, up-tilted seafloors" have left on the coastline. "The rocks have a tortured appearance", Cameron writes, "abrupt, sharp shapes, angled striations, rapid shifts of colour from pink to white, rust, green, grey, black. The geology looks like frozen violence: layers of rock bent, twisted, broken, folded, thrust upward, knocked sideways, pressed downward."&#91;17&#93;
In Wind, Whales and Whisky, Cameron discusses one of the ironies he sees about life in Cape Breton. On the one hand, the island seems poor with chronic unemployment, but on the other, its rural inhabitants have access to abundant and delicious food such as apples, cranberries, fish, deer, moose and the produce from their gardens. After describing "the most unbelievably wonderful meal of the voyage"—lobster and grey sole baked in the oven with tinned mushroom soup accompanied by scalloped potatoes and broccoli, Cameron writes: "I love living in a depressed region, I thought. One lives so well."&#91;17&#93; In a chapter entitled, "Good People in Bad Times", Cameron outlines the troubles of industrial Cape Breton including the long decline of two of its economic mainstays, coal mining and steel making. "It is a hard place to make a living", he writes, "but it is a wonderful place to live."
Industrial Cape Breton is raucous and funny, full of music and theatre and satire. It is gossipy and anecdotal, tolerant of eccentricity, generous and co-operative. It is tenacious, disorderly, skeptical of authority, lethal to pomposity and pretension. It is fecund, unruly and affectionate.&#91;17&#93;
Newspaper reviewers praised Wind, Whales and Whisky as entertaining, joyful and informative. One, who grew up on Cape Breton Island, wrote that the book brought back many memories: "I could smell the salt and feel the warmth of those country kitchens and hear the intoxicating song of the fiddle ... There are moonshiners and poets in this book, fishermen and ghosts, Buddhist monks and singing coal miners, cock-fighters and priests. There's also a pretty good recipe for moonshine you could try if you're willing to risk $500 in fines and maybe six months in jail."&#91;24&#93;
His writing and journalism earned him numerous awards including the Evelyn Richardson Award, the Atlantic Provinces Booksellers Award and the City of Dartmouth Book Award. One of his television dramas won a Best Short Film award and he earned four National Magazine Awards as well as two awards for his corporate writing.&#91;3&#93; In 2012, Cameron received both the Order of Canada and the Order of Nova Scotia.&#91;10&#93;&#91;25&#93;
Cameron wrote about the Terrios, a large family in D'Escousse. One of the Terrio daughters, Marie Louise "Lulu" Terrio had gone to Denmark the year before he moved to the village to study biochemistry at the University of Copenhagen. She became an ardent sailor in Denmark, married a Dane and gave birth to a son named Mark Patrick. When her marriage ended, she moved back to D'Escousse with her son and, "nervous as a schoolboy," Cameron asked her to help him sail his schooner to Louisbourg, Cape Breton in 1979. He writes that he fell "hopelessly in love with her" when she asked him to take the tiller, vomited over the side, "wiped her mouth, climbed back to the afterdeck and reached for the tiller." They were married in May 1980 in D'Escousse and 10 years later sailed around Cape Breton Island in Silversark, a voyage recounted in Wind, Whales and Whisky.&#91;17&#93;
Lulu Terrio-Cameron died of breast cancer in April 1996. "We had 16 years of blissful happiness", Cameron told a journalist adding "it was the kind of marriage that every day I felt myself filled with wonder that I had such a person to share my life with. Every day I said a little prayer of thanks."&#91;26&#93;
Cameron was married to the writer Marjorie Simmins and was the father of five children from two previous marriages. He divided his time between Halifax and D'Escousse, Cape Breton.&#91;5&#93;
Cameron died in a Halifax hospital on June 1, 2020, after being diagnosed with lung cancer. His death came just a few weeks before his latest non-fiction book Blood in the Water: A True Story of Revenge in the Maritimes was due to be released. The book describes the circumstances around the murder of a small-time criminal who had been terrorizing the small Cape Breton community of Petit-de-Grat for many years.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;
He is the author of numerous books, including:

Osia Lewis (December 3, 1962 – May 31, 2020) was an American professional arena football player who played four seasons in the Arena Football League with the Chicago Bruisers and Albany Firebirds. He played college football at Oregon State University and attended Tucson High School in Tucson, Arizona.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;
Lewis was a four-year letterman for the Oregon State Beavers from 1982 to 1985. He primarily played linebacker but also saw time at quarterback, safety and wide receiver for the Beavers. As a senior in 1985, he was named the team's Most Inspirational Player, served as team captain and earned All-Pac-10 and honorable mention All-America honors by the Associated Press. Lewis set school records for single-season defensive points, season fumble recoveries with four and career fumble recoveries with eight.&#91;3&#93;
Lewis played for the Chicago Bruisers from 1987 to 1989, earning Second Team All-Arena honors in 1988.&#91;4&#93; He played for the Albany Firebirds in 1990.&#91;4&#93;
Lewis was an assistant coach for the Western Oregon Wolves of Western Oregon State College from 1989 to 1990.&#91;5&#93; He served as an assistant coach for the Oregon State Beavers of Oregon State University, working with linebackers and special teams from 1991 to 1996.&#91;5&#93; He was defensive line coach for the Illinois Fighting Illini of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1997 to 2000 before serving as linebackers coach from 2001 to 2002.&#91;5&#93; Lewis was defensive coordinator of the New Mexico Lobos of the University of New Mexico from 2003 to 2007 while also serving stints as defensive line and linebacker coach.&#91;5&#93; He served as defensive coordinator of the UTEP Miners of the University of Texas at El Paso from 2008 to 2009.&#91;5&#93; He was defensive coordinator of the Hartford Colonials of the United Football League in 2010.&#91;5&#93; Lewis served as defensive line coach of the San Diego State Aztecs of San Diego State University from 2011 to 2015.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93; In February 2016, he joined the Vanderbilt Commodores of Vanderbilt University as a senior defensive assistant and outside linebackers coach.&#91;8&#93;
Lewis died May 31, 2020 from liver cancer. He was 57 years old.&#91;9&#93;

Christo Vladimirov Javacheff (1935–2020) and Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon (1935–2009), known as Christo and Jeanne-Claude, were artists noted for their large-scale, site-specific environmental installations, often large landmarks and landscape elements wrapped in fabric, including the Wrapped Reichstag, The Pont Neuf Wrapped, Running Fence in California, and The Gates in New York City's Central Park.
Born in Bulgaria and Morocco, respectively, the pair met and married in Paris in the late 1950s. Originally working under Christo's name, they later credited their installations to both "Christo and Jeanne-Claude." Until his own death, Christo continued to plan and execute projects after Jeanne-Claude's death in 2009.
Their work was typically large, visually impressive and controversial, often taking years and sometimes decades of careful preparation – including technical solutions, political negotiation, permitting and environmental approval, hearings and public persuasion. The pair refused grants, scholarships, donations or public money, instead financing the work via the sale of their own artwork. 
Christo and Jean Claude described the myriad elements that brought the projects to fruition as integral to the artwork itself, and said their projects contained no deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic impact; their purpose being simply for joy, beauty, and new ways of seeing the familiar.
Christo and Jeanne-Claude met in October 1958 when he was commissioned to paint a portrait of her mother, Précilda de Guillebon.&#91;1&#93; Their first show, in Cologne, 1961, showcased the three types of artworks for which they would be known: wrapped items, oil barrels, and ephemeral, large-scale works.&#91;2&#93; Near Christo's first solo show in Paris, in 1962, the pair blocked an alley with 240 barrels for several hours in a piece called Iron Curtain, a poetic reply to the Berlin Wall.&#91;3&#93;
They developed consistent, longtime terms of their collaboration. They together imagined projects, for which Christo would create sketches and preparatory works that were later sold to fund the resulting installation. Christo and Jeanne-Claude hired assistants to do the work of wrapping the object at hand. They originally worked under the name "Christo" to simplify dealings and their brand,&#91;4&#93; given the difficulties of establishing an artist's reputation and the prejudices against female artists,&#91;5&#93; but they would later retroactively credit their large-scale outdoor works to both "Christo and Jeanne-Claude".&#91;4&#93; They eventually flew in separate planes such that, in case one crashed, the other could continue their work.&#91;6&#93; 
The couple relocated to New York City, the new art world capital, in 1964. Christo began to make Store Fronts, wooden facades made to resemble shop windows, which he continued for four years. His largest piece was shown in the 1968 Documenta 4. In the mid-1960s, they also created Air Packages,&#91;7&#93; inflated and wrapped research balloons.&#91;8&#93; In 1969, they wrapped the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art while it remained open. It was panned by the public and ordered to be undone by the fire department, which went unenforced.&#91;9&#93; With the help of Australian collector John Kaldor, Christo and Jeanne-Claude and 100 volunteers wrapped the coast of Sydney's Little Bay as Wrapped Coast, the first piece for Kaldor Public Art Projects.&#91;10&#93;

Within a year of Wrapped Coast, Christo began work on Valley Curtain:&#91;11&#93; an orange curtain of fabric to be hung across the mountainous Colorado State Highway 325.&#91;12&#93; They simultaneously worked on Wrapped Walk Ways (Tokyo and Holland) and Wrapped Island (South Pacific), neither of which came to fruition.&#91;11&#93; The artists formed a corporation to benefit from tax and other liabilities, a form they used for later projects.&#91;11&#93; Following a failed attempt to mount the curtain in late 1971, a new engineer and builder-contractor raised the fabric in August 1972. The work only stood for 28 hours before the wind again destroyed the fabric. This work, their most expensive to date and first to involve construction workers, was captured in a documentary by David and Albert Maysles.&#91;12&#93; Christo's Valley Curtain was nominated for Best Documentary Short in the 1974 Academy Awards.&#91;13&#93; The Maysles would film many of the artists' later projects.&#91;12&#93;
Inspired by a snow fence, in 1972, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began preparations for Running Fence: a 24.5-mile fence of white nylon, supported by steel posts and steel cables, running through the Californian landscape and into the ocean. In exchange for temporary use of ranch land, the artists agreed to offer payment and use of the deconstructed building materials. Others challenged its construction in 18 public hearings and three state court sessions. The fence began construction in April 1976 and the project culminated in a two-week display in September, after which it was deconstructed.&#91;14&#93;
Their 1978 Wrapped Walk Ways covered paths within Kansas City, Missouri's Loose Park in fabric.&#91;15&#93;

Christo and Jeanne-Claude planned a project based on Jeanne-Claude's idea to surround eleven islands in Miami's Biscayne Bay with 603,850 ;m2 (6,499,800 ;sq ;ft) of pink polypropylene floating fabric. It was completed on May 7, 1983, with the aid of 430 workers and could be admired for two weeks. The workers were outfitted with pink long sleeve shirts with pale blue text written on the back reading “Christo Surrounded Islands”, and then in acknowledging the garment's deigner, "designed and produced by Willi Smith".&#91;16&#93;
Jeanne-Claude became an American citizen in March 1984.&#91;17&#93; The couple received permission to wrap the Pont Neuf, a bridge in Paris, in August and the wrapped the bridge in for two weeks in August 1985. The project attracted three million visitors.&#91;18&#93; Wrapping the Pont Neuf continued the tradition of transforming a sculptural dimension into a work of art. The fabric maintained the principal shapes of the Pont Neuf but it emphasized the details and the proportions. As with Surrounded Islands, workers who assisted with the installation and deinstallation of Pont Neuf Wrapped wore uniforms designed by Willi Smith.&#91;16&#93;

Their 1991 The Umbrellas involved the simultaneous setup of blue and gold umbrellas in Japan and California, respectively. The 3,100-umbrella project cost US$26 million and attracted three million visitors.&#91;19&#93; Christo closed the exhibition early after a woman was crushed by a windswept umbrella in California.&#91;20&#93; Separately, a worker was killed during the deconstruction of the Japanese exhibit.&#91;21&#93;
Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped the Berlin Reichstag building in 1995 following 24 years of governmental lobbying across six Bundestag presidents. Wrapped Reichstag&#39;s 100,000 square meters of silver fabric draped the building, fastened with blue rope.&#91;22&#93; Christo described the Reichstag wrapping as autobiographical based on his Bulgarian upbringing.&#91;23&#93; The wrapping became symbolic of unified Germany and marked Berlin's return as a world city.&#91;24&#93; The Guardian posthumously described the work as their "most spectacular achievement".&#91;25&#93;
In 1998, the artists wrapped trees at the Beyeler Foundation and its nearby Berower Park. Prior attempts had failed to secure government support in Saint Louis, Missouri, and Paris. The work was self-funded through sale of photographic documentation and preparatory works, as had become standard for the couple.&#91;26&#93;
Work began on the installation of the couple's most protracted project, The Gates, in New York City's Central Park in January 2005. Its full title, The Gates, Central Park, New York, 1979–2005, refers to the time that passed from their initial proposal until they were able to go ahead with it with the permission of the new mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.&#91;27&#93; The Gates was open to the public from February 12–27, 2005. A total of 7,503 gates made of saffron-colored fabric were placed on paths in Central Park. They were five meters (16 ;ft) high and had a combined length of 37 ;km (23 ;mi). The mayor presented them with the Doris C. Freedman Award for public art.&#91;28&#93; The project cost an estimated US$21 million, which the artists planned to recoup by selling project documentation.&#91;29&#93;
The London Mastaba was a temporary floating installation exhibited from June to September 2018 on The Serpentine in London. The installation consisted of 7,506 oil barrels, in the shape of a mastaba, a form of an early bench in use in ancient Mesopotamia, with a flat roof and inward sloping sides. It sat on a floating platform of high-density polyethene, held in place by 32 anchors. It was 20 ;m (66 ;ft) in height and weighed 600 tonnes (660 short tons). The vertical ends were painted in a mosaic of red, blue and mauve, whilst the sloping sides were in red with bands of white.&#91;37&#93;
Simultaneously with the display of The London Mastaba, the nearby Serpentine Gallery presented an exhibition of the artists' work, entitled Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Barrels and The Mastaba 1958–2018. The exhibition comprised sculptures, drawings, collages, scale-models and photographs from the last 60 years of the artists' work.&#91;38&#93;
Another Mastaba of over 400,000 oil barrels is intended to be built at Al Gharbia, 160 ;km (100 ;mi) from the city Abu Dhabi.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;
Christo and Jeanne-Claude announced plans  for a future project, titled Over The River, to be constructed on the Arkansas River between Salida, Colorado, and Cañon City, Colorado, on the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains. Plans for the project call for horizontally suspending 10.8 ;km (6.7 ;mi) of reflective, translucent fabric panels high above the water, on steel cables anchored into the river's banks. Project plans called for its installation for two weeks during the summer of 2015, at the earliest, and for the river to remain open to recreation during the installation. Reaction among area residents was intense, with supporters hoping for a tourist boom and opponents fearing that the project would ruin the visual appeal of the landscape and inflict damage on the river ecosystem. One local rafting guide compared the project to "hanging pornography in a church."  The U.S. Bureau of Land Management released a Record of Decision approving the project on November 7, 2011.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93;&#91;43&#93; Work on the project cannot begin, however, until the Bureau of Land Management issues a Notice to Proceed.&#91;44&#93; A lawsuit against the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife was filed on July 22, 2011, by Rags Over the Arkansas River (ROAR), a local group opposed to the project.&#91;45&#93; The lawsuit is still awaiting a court date.&#91;46&#93;
Christo and Jeanne-Claude's inspiration for Over the River came in 1985 as they were wrapping the Pont-Neuf and a fabric panel was being elevated over the Seine. The artists began a three-year search for appropriate locations in 1992, considering some eighty-nine river locations. They chose the Arkansas River because its banks were high enough that recreational rafters could enjoy the river at the same time.&#91;47&#93;
In January 2017, after the election of President Trump, Christo canceled the controversial project citing protest of the new administration as well as tiring from the hard-fought legal battle waged by  local residents.&#91;50&#93;&#91;51&#93;
Continuing their series of monumental "wrapping" projects, the Arc de Triomphe in Paris is to be wrapped in 30,000 square meters of recyclable polypropylene fabric in silvery blue, and 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) of red rope in the Autumn of 2020.&#91;52&#93; This was postponed a year to Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France and its impact on the arts and cultural sector worldwide.&#91;53&#93; Following Christo's death, his office stated that the project would nevertheless be completed.&#91;54&#93;
Christo and Jeanne-Claude's work is held by many major public collections.&#91;55&#93; The artists received the 1995 Praemium Imperiale,&#91;56&#93; the 2006 Vilcek Prize,&#91;57&#93; and the 2004 International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.&#91;58&#93; Art critic David Bourdon described Christo's wrappings as a "revelation through concealment."&#91;59&#93; Unto his critics Christo replied, "I am an artist, and I have to have courage ;... Do you know that I don't have any artworks that exist?  They all go away when they're finished.  Only the preparatory drawings, and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain."&#91;60&#93; Jeanne-Claude was a firm believer in the aesthetic beauty of works of art; she said, "'We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build because we believe it will be beautiful.'"&#91;4&#93;
Christo Vladimirov Javacheff (Bulgarian: Христо Владимиров Явашев, [hrisˈtɔ vlɐˈdimirof jɐˈvɑʃef]) was born on June 13, 1935, in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, as the second of three sons to Tzveta Dimitrov and Vladimir Javacheff, who worked at a textile manufacturer.&#91;61&#93; Christo was shy&#91;62&#93; and had a predilection for art. He received private art instruction at a young age and the support of his parents,&#91;61&#93; who invited visiting artists to their house.&#91;63&#93; Christo was particularly affected by events from World War II and his country's fluid borders.&#91;64&#93; During evacuations, he and his brothers stayed with a family in the rural hills outside town, where Christo connected with nature and handicraft.&#91;65&#93; 
While Bulgaria was under repressive totalitarian rule, and Western art was suppressed, Christo pursued realistic painting through the mid-1950s. He was admitted into the Sofia Academy of Fine Arts in 1953&#91;66&#93; but found the school dull and stifling.&#91;67&#93; Instead, he found inspiration in Skira art books, and visiting Russian professors who were older than he and once active in Russian modernism and the Soviet avant-garde. On the weekends, academy students were sent to paint propaganda and Christo unhappily participated.&#91;68&#93; He found work as a location scout for the state cinema and served three tours of duty during summer breaks.&#91;69&#93; In 1956, he used an academy connection to receive permission to visit family in Prague,&#91;70&#93; where the theater of Emil František Burian reinvigorated him.&#91;71&#93; Amid fears of further Russian suppression in Hungary, Christo decided to flee to Vienna as a railcar stowaway. He had little money after paying the bribe, did not speak the language, had deserted during his Bulgarian military service, and feared being trapped in a refugee camp.&#91;72&#93; 
In Vienna, he stayed with a family friend (who had not expected him), studied at the Vienna Fine Arts Academy, and surrendered his passport to seek political asylum as a stateless person.&#91;73&#93; There, he supported himself with commissions and briefly visited Italy with the academy, whose program he found equally unhappy as the one before it. At the behest of a friend relocated from Sofia, he saved up to visit Geneva in late 1957.&#91;74&#93; In violation of his visa, he continued to pursue commissions (whose works he would sign with his family name, reserving his given name for more serious work) and was transformed after visiting the Kunstmuseum Basel and Kunsthaus Zürich.&#91;75&#93; In January 1958, he first began to wrap things, as would become his trademark, starting with a paint can.&#91;76&#93; His collection of wrapped household items would be known as his Inventory. In February 1958, Christo left for Paris, having received a visa with the assistance of a Sofia academy connection.&#91;77&#93;  ;
In 1973, after 17 stateless years, Christo became a United States citizen.&#91;78&#93; He died at his home in New York City on May 31, 2020, at 84. No cause of death was specified.&#91;79&#93; L’Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped, a planned work by Christo and Jeane-Claude, is to go ahead posthumously in Paris in September 2021.&#91;80&#93;
Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon was born in Casablanca, Morocco, where her father, an army officer, was stationed. Her mother, Précilda, was 17 when she married Jeanne-Claude's father, Major Léon Denat. Précilda and Léon Denat divorced shortly after Jeanne-Claude was born, and Précilda remarried three times. Jeanne-Claude earned a baccalauréat in Latin and philosophy in 1952 from the University of Tunis.&#91;4&#93; After Précilda married the General Jacques de Guillebon in 1947, the family lived in Bern (1948–1951) and Tunisia (1952–1957) before returning to Paris.&#91;81&#93;
Jeanne-Claude was described as "extroverted" and with natural organizational abilities. Her hair was dyed red, which she claimed was selected by her husband.&#91;82&#93; She took responsibility for overseeing work crews and for raising funds.&#91;6&#93;
Jeanne-Claude died in New York City on November 18, 2009, from complications due to a brain aneurysm. Her body was to be donated to science, one of her final wishes.&#91;83&#93; When she died, she and Christo were at work on Over the River&#91;84&#93; and the United Arab Emirates project, The Mastaba.&#91;4&#93; She said, "Artists don't retire. They die. That's all. When they stop being able to create art, they die."&#91;85&#93;
Christo and Jeanne-Claude met in October 1958 when he was commissioned to paint a portrait of her mother, Précilda de Guillebon.&#91;1&#93; Initially, Christo was attracted to Jeanne-Claude's half-sister, Joyce. Jeanne-Claude was engaged to Philippe Planchon.&#91;86&#93; Shortly before her wedding, Jeanne-Claude became pregnant by Christo. Although she married Planchon, Jeanne-Claude left him immediately after their honeymoon.&#91;87&#93; Christo and Jeanne-Claude's son, Cyril, was born on May 11, 1960.&#91;88&#93;

Jayanendra Chand Thakuri (Nepali:जयनेन्द्र चन्द ठकुरी, 1942&#91;1&#93; ;&#8211;&#32;31 May 2020) was a Nepali actor known for his work in Nepali cinema. Thakuri acted in more than 100 films, including Kanchhi, Bishwas, Maya Preeti, Pheri Bhetaula, Angarakshyak and Parkhi Base. He died on 31 May 2020, having been paralysed for nine years and bedridden the last six months. He was married to Shanti Chand Thakuri; they had a daughter.
Thakuri was born in Baitadi of Far-Western Nepal, to father, Sheel Chanda, and mother, Rukmini Devi Chanda.&#91;1&#93; He was in the Indian Army.&#91;2&#93; He played cricket from Jawalakhel Youth Club.&#91;2&#93; Thakuri was married to Shanti Chand Thakuri, with whom he had one daughter, Chaya Upreti.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93;
Thakuri had been paralysed for the last nine years, having injured himself during a film-shoot in 2011. He had additional health problems including a high blood pressure and diabetes.&#91;5&#93; He was mostly bedridden the last six months of his life.&#91;3&#93;
On 31 May 2020, Thakuri died at 11:20 ;a.m. (NPT) in his own home in Lalitpur.&#91;9&#93;&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93; He was cremated the same day at the Pashupati Electric Crematorium.&#91;11&#93; The funeral was attended by the members of Film Artists Association of Nepal and Film Development Board.&#91;3&#93;

June 3 is the 154th day of the year&#32;(155th in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar.&#32; 211 days remain until the end of the year.

The calendar of saints is the traditional Christian method of organizing a liturgical year by associating each day with one or more saints and referring to the day as the feast day or feast of said saint. The word "feast" in this context does not mean "a large meal, typically a celebratory one", but instead "an annual religious celebration, a day dedicated to a particular saint".&#91;1&#93; 
The system arose from the early Christian custom of commemorating each martyr annually on the date of their death, or birth into heaven, a date therefore referred to in Latin as the martyr's dies natalis ('day of birth'). In the Eastern Orthodox Church, a calendar of saints is called a Menologion.&#91;2&#93; "Menologion" may also mean a set of icons on which saints are depicted in the order of the dates of their feasts, often made in two panels.
As the number of recognized saints increased during Late Antiquity and the first half of the Middle Ages, eventually every day of the year had at least one saint who was commemorated on that date. To deal with this increase, some saints were moved to alternate days in some traditions or completely removed, with the result that some saints have different feast days in different calendars. For example, St. Perpetua and Felicity died on 7 March, but this date was later assigned to St. Thomas Aquinas, allowing them only a commemoration (see Tridentine Calendar), so in 1908 they were moved one day earlier.&#91;3&#93; When the 1969 reform of the Catholic calendar moved him to 28 January, they were moved back to 7 March (see General Roman Calendar). Both days can thus be said to be their feast day, in different traditions. The Roman Catholic calendars of saints in their various forms, which list those saints celebrated in the entire church, contains only a selection of the saints for each of its days. A fuller list is found in the Roman Martyrology, and some of the saints there may be celebrated locally.
The earliest feast days of saints were those of martyrs, venerated as having shown for Christ the greatest form of love, in accordance with the teaching: "Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."&#91;4&#93; Saint Martin of Tours is said to be the first&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; or at least one of the first non-martyrs to be venerated as a saint. The title "confessor" was used for such saints, who had confessed their faith in Christ by their lives rather than by their deaths. Martyrs are regarded as dying in the service of the Lord, and confessors are people who died natural deaths. A broader range of titles was used later, such as: Virgin, Pastor, Bishop, Monk, Priest, Founder, Abbot, Apostle, Doctor of the Church.
The Tridentine Missal has common formulæ for Masses of Martyrs, Confessors who were bishops, Doctors of the Church, Confessors who were not Bishops, Abbots, Virgins, Non-Virgins, Dedication of Churches, and Feast Days of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Pope Pius XII added a common formula for Popes. The 1962 Roman Missal of Pope John XXIII omitted the common of Apostles, assigning a proper Mass to every feast day of an Apostle. The present Roman Missal has common formulas for the Dedication of Churches, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Martyrs (with special formulas for missionary martyrs and virgin martyrs), Pastors (subdivided into bishops, generic pastors, founders of churches, and missionaries), Doctors of the Church, Virgins, and (generic) Saints (with special formulas for abbots, monks, nuns, religious, those noted for works of mercy, educators, and [generically] women saints).
This calendar system, when combined with major church festivals and movable and immovable feasts, constructs a very human and personalised yet often localized way of organizing the year and identifying dates. Some Christians continue the tradition of dating by saints' days: their works may appear "dated" as "The Feast of Saint Martin". Poets such as John Keats commemorate the importance of The Eve of Saint Agnes.
As different Christian jurisdictions parted ways theologically, differing lists of saints began to develop. This happened because the same individual may be considered differently by one church; in extreme examples, one church's saint may be another church's heretic, as in the cases of Nestorius, Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria, or Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople.
Feast days are ranked in accordance with their importance. In the post-Vatican II form of the Roman Rite, feast days are ranked (in descending order of importance) as solemnities, feasts or memorials (obligatory or optional).&#91;7&#93; Pope John XXIII's 1960 Code of Rubrics, whose use remains authorized by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, divides liturgical days into I, II, III, and IV class days. Those who use even earlier forms of the Roman Rite rank feast days as Doubles (of three or four kinds), Semidoubles, and Simples. See Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church the ranking of feasts varies from church to church. In the Russian Orthodox Church they are: Great Feasts, middle, and minor feasts. Each portion of such feasts may also be called feasts as follows: All-Night Vigils, Polyeleos, Great Doxology, Sextuple ("sixfold", having six stichera at Vespers and six troparia at the Canon of Matins). There are also distinctions between Simple feasts and Double (i.e., two simple feasts celebrated together). In Double Feasts the order of hymns and readings for each feast are rigidly instructed in Typikon, the liturgy book.
The Lutheran Churches celebrate Festivals, Lesser Festivals, Days of Devotion, and Commemorations.&#91;8&#93;
In the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion, there are Principal Feasts and Principal Holy Days, Festivals, Lesser Festivals, and Commemorations.
Before the advent of standardized naming of tropical storms and hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin, tropical storms and hurricanes that affected the island of Puerto Rico were informally named after the Catholic saints corresponding to the feast days when the cyclones either made landfall or started to seriously affect the island. Examples are: the 1780 San Calixto hurricane (more widely known as the Great Hurricane of 1780) (the deadliest in the North Atlantic basin's recorded history; named after Pope Callixtus I (Saint Callixtus), whose feast day is October ;14),&#91;9&#93; the 1867 San Narciso hurricane (named after Saint Narcissus of Jerusalem, feast day October ;29),&#91;9&#93; the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane (the deadliest in the island's recorded history; Saint Cyriacus, August ;8),&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; the 1928 San Felipe hurricane (the strongest in terms of measured wind speed; Saint Philip, father of Saint Eugenia of Rome, September ;13),&#91;9&#93; and the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane (Saint Cyprian, September ;26).&#91;9&#93;
This practice continued until quite some time after the United States Weather Bureau (now called the National Weather Service) started publishing and using official female human names (initially; male names were added starting in 1979 after the NWS relinquished control over naming to the World Meteorological Organization). The last two usages of this informal naming scheme in P.R. were in 1956 (Hurricane Betsy, locally nicknamed Santa Clara after Saint Clare of Assisi, feast day August ;12 back then; her feast day was advanced one day in 1970) and 1960 (Hurricane Donna, nicknamed San Lorenzo after Saint Lawrence Justinian, September ;5 back then; feast day now observed January ;8 by Canons regular of St. Augustine).&#91;9&#93;

Charles Lwanga (Luganda: Kaloli Lwanga (1 January 1860&#91;1&#93;&#91;4&#93; ;&#8211;&#32;3 June 1886) was a Ugandan convert to the Catholic Church, who was martyred for his faith and is revered as a saint by both the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.&#91;5&#93;
A member of the Baganda tribe, Lwanga was born in the Kingdom of Buganda, the central and southern part of modern Uganda, and served as chief of the royal pages and later major-domo in the court of King Mwanga II of Buganda. He was baptised by Pere Giraud on 15 November 1885.&#91;6&#93;
As part of the king's effort to resist foreign colonization, the king insisted that Christian converts abandon their new faith and executed many Anglicans and Catholics between 1885 and 1887, including Lwanga and other officials in the royal court or otherwise very close to him.&#91;7&#93;
The persecution started in 1885 after Mwanga, a ritual pedophile, ordered a massacre of Anglican missionaries, including Bishop James Hannington who was the leader of the Anglican community. Joseph Mukasa Balikuddembe, the Catholic major-domo of the court and a lay catechist, reproached the king for the killings, against which he had counseled him. Mwanga had Balikuddembe beheaded and arrested all of his followers on 15 November 1885. The king then ordered that Lwanga, who was chief page at that time, take up Balikuddembe's duties. That same day, Lwanga and other pages under his protection sought baptism as Catholics by a missionary priest of the White Fathers; some hundred catechumens were baptized.  Lwanga often protected boys in his charge from the king's sexual advances.&#91;8&#93;
On 25 May 1886, Mwanga ordered a general assembly of the court while they were settled at Munyonyo, where he condemned two of the pages to death. The following morning, Lwanga secretly baptized those of his charges who were still only catechumens. Later that day, the king called a court assembly in which he interrogated all present to see if any would renounce Christianity. Led by Lwanga, the royal pages declared their fidelity to their religion, upon which the king condemned them to death, directing that they be marched to the traditional place of execution. Three of the prisoners, Pontian Ngondwe, Athanasius Bazzekuketta, and Gonzaga Gonza, were murdered on the march there.&#91;9&#93;
When preparations were completed and the day had come for the execution on 3 June 1886, Lwanga was separated from the others by the Guardian of the Sacred Flame for private execution, in keeping with custom. As he was being burnt, Lwanga said to the Guardian, "It is as if you are pouring water on me. Please repent and become a Christian like me."&#91;1&#93;
Twelve Catholic boys and men and nine Anglicans were then burnt alive. Another Catholic, Mbaga Tuzinde, was clubbed to death for refusing to renounce Christianity, and his body was thrown into the furnace to be burned along with those of Lwanga and the others&#91;10&#93; The ire of the king was particularly inflamed against the Christians because they refused to participate in sexual acts with him.&#91;11&#93; Lwanga, in particular, had protected the pages.&#91;4&#93; The executions were also motivated by Mwanga's broader efforts to avoid foreign threats to his power. According to Assa Okoth, Mwanga's overriding preoccupation was for the "integrity of his kingdom", and perceived that men such as Lwanga were working with foreigners in "poisoning the very roots of his kingdom". Not to have taken any action could have led to suggestions that he was a weak sovereign.&#91;12&#93;
Lwanga senior and the other Christians who accompanied him in death were canonized on 18 October 1964 by Pope Paul VI during the Vatican II conference.&#91;13&#93; "To honor these African saints, Paul VI became the first reigning pope to visit sub-Saharan Africa when he toured Uganda in July 1969, a visit that included a pilgrimage to the site of the martyrdom at Namugongo".&#91;14&#93;
The Basilica of the Uganda Martyrs was built at the site of the executions and serves as their shrine.&#91;15&#93; The Brothers of St. Charles Lwanga senior (Luganda: Bannakaroli Brothers) were founded in 1927 as an indigenous religious congregation of Ugandan men committed to providing education to the disadvantaged youth of their country.&#91;16&#93;

The Uganda Martyrs are a group of 23 Anglican and 22 Catholic converts to Christianity in the historical kingdom of Buganda, now part of Uganda, who were executed between 31 January 1885 and 27 January 1887.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;
They were killed on orders of Mwanga II, the Kabaka (King) of Buganda. The deaths took place at a time when there was a three-way religious struggle for political influence at the Buganda royal court. The episode also occurred against the backdrop of the "Scramble for Africa" – the invasion, occupation, division, colonization and annexation of African territory by European powers.&#91;4&#93; A few years after, the English Church Missionary Society used the deaths to enlist wider public support for the British acquisition of Uganda for the Empire.&#91;5&#93; The Catholic Church beatified the 22 Catholic martyrs of its faith in 1920 and canonized them in 1964.
Publication in Britain of an 1875 letter purporting to be an invitation from the king of Buganda, Muteesa I, to send missionaries, resulted in the arrival of Alexander Mackay of the Anglican Church Missionary Society to Buganda in 1877. A group of French Catholic White Fathers, led by Père Simon Lourdel (Fr. Mapera) appeared two years later. Arab traders from Zanzibar had introduced Islam into the kingdom.&#91;6&#93; This effectively led to a three-way religious struggle for political influence at the Buganda royal court.&#91;4&#93; By the mid-1880s, many had been converted by each of the three groups, and some of the converts held important posts at the king's court.&#91;7&#93; Muteesa himself sympathized with Islam, but many prominent chiefs had become Christians.&#91;8&#93;
Kabaka Mwanga II succeeded to the throne in 1884. He was concerned at the growing influence of Christianity and the rise of a new class of officials, distinct from the traditional territorial chiefs, who were educated, had a religious orientation, and wished to reform Ganda society.&#91;9&#93; The German annexation of what is now Tanzania sparked further alarm. A year after becoming king he ordered the execution of Yusufu Rugarama, Makko Kakumba, and Nuwa/Noah Serwanga, who had converted to Christianity.&#91;3&#93; Encouraged by his prime minister, on 29 October 1885 he had the incoming Anglican bishop James Hannington assassinated on the eastern border of his kingdom. This may have been deliberately intended to ward off a potential British invasion.&#91;10&#93; Mwanga did, however, subsequently appoint several Christians to important military positions.&#91;9&#93;
In 1886 Mwanga ordered the executions of a number of his pages. Heike Behrend says they were both Christian and Muslim converts; other sources speak only of Anglican and Catholic victims, and mention the killing of Muslims as having occurred ten years earlier at the hands of Mwanga's father Muteesa.&#91;11&#93; Joseph Mukasa, a convert to Christianity who had deplored the assassination of Hannington, and had tried to protect the court pages, was the first to be executed on 15 November 1885:&#91;12&#93; this was at the instigation of the Katikkiro (prime minister) Mukasa, whose successor Joseph Mukasa was tipped to become king.&#91;13&#93; Then, between 25 May and 3 June 1886, a wider series of executions were carried out.&#91;3&#93;&#91;14&#93; Mwanga instructed the killing of all the young men who disobeyed him – partly to satisfy the demands of the older chiefs. Twenty-two of the men, who had converted to Catholicism, were burned alive at Namugongo in 1886.
"The reasons behind the persecution are still heavily debated", Behrend states.&#91;15&#93; Political factors certainly played a part. Those killed included minor chiefs, some of whom, such as Joseph Mukasa, were "the victims of particular grudges by their seniors ;... jealous that these up and coming young men would soon be ousting them from power".&#91;10&#93;&#91;13&#93; Ward has argued that the motivation was the perception that "these Christians were rebels against the Kabaka, unwitting tools of foreign imperialism".&#91;10&#93;
A witness to the event, the French missionary priest Lourdel, considered that the principal cause was Mwanga's feeling of being despised by the literate Christians who claimed a superior knowledge of religion. Lourdel gave as a secondary cause of Mwanga's action "the impossibility of satisfying his shameful passions".&#91;16&#93; Ward certainly notes that "the immediate cause of the killings was the refusal of the pages to engage in homosexual practices". The king, who by tradition had the power of life and death over his subjects, was angered by this refusal to obey his wishes to have sex with him.&#91;3&#93;
Marie de Kiewet-Hemphill concludes that the immediate pretext, if not the whole cause, was therefore the refusal of the pages to yield to Mwanga&#91;17&#93; Roland Oliver rejects resentment against Christianity as a sufficient reason, since it does not explain why Mwanga took action against these young men and not against prominent chiefs and women among the converts.&#91;18&#93; Sylvia Antonia Nannyonga-Tamusuza draws attention to the same point.&#91;19&#93; J. P. Thoonen in his book on the question agrees with Kiewet-Hemphill's analysis, while recognizing the existence of other political factors.&#91;20&#93; Particularly as some of those that renounced their faith were spared death."&#91;21&#93;
In the week leading to the executions, the Christian Matthias Gayinga rejected the sexual demands of Mwanga's close friend, the Muslim Lutaya, to whom the king had sent him for that purpose. For this he was severely punished, though not killed. His gesture was described as a "splendid refusal" by the English missionary A. P. Ashe, who later said it set the spark for later events. This action was followed by the refusal of another convert, Anatole Kirrigwajjo, to accept nomination to a high post "which he could only exercise at the peril of his soul".&#91;21&#93;
While many of the Christian pages often arranged to be missing when Mwanga wanted them or refused his demands outright, one page Muwafi did comply. Mwanga is said to have caught another page teaching Christianity to Muwafi. He saw this as an attempt "to rob him of his favourite and so far always compliant toy by teaching him the religion which made them prefer death to submission to his shameful demands".&#91;13&#93;&#91;19&#93;&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; Mwanga summoned the pages and asked those who prayed to stand to one side. These, most of whom were between 15 and 30 years old, were then taken on a long journey to execution by being burnt alive. By displaying what courage Christianity demanded, they helped remove any notion that the new religion was inconsistent with traditional ideals of heroism.&#91;13&#93;
The converts, at least the Catholics, had been taught they risked martyrdom.&#91;13&#93; The secular press of the time described them as martyrs.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93; The same description appeared also, of course, in religious publications, both Protestant, such as the journal of the missionary Mackay published in the Intellegencer of 1886,&#91;26&#93; and Catholic, such as the accounts of the missionaries Lourdel, Denoit, and Delmas published in Enquête relative au martyre des chrétiens: Ste Marie de Rubaga, Buganda 1888 and Les Missions Catholiques 18 (1886).&#91;13&#93;
News of Mwanga's actions provoked contradictory reactions in Britain. Some saw it as a sign of the futility of missionary efforts in Buganda, others as a call to renewed efforts. The Times of 30 October 1886, quoting the dictum, "the blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church", stated: "On the success of the Uganda experiment, with its alternation of favourable and adverse circumstances, depends the happiness of the interior of the vast continent for generations."&#91;24&#93; This sentiment developed into a campaign for British intervention in the region.&#91;27&#93;
In September 1888, Mwanga planned to get rid of remaining Christian and Muslim leaders by leaving them to starve on an island in crocodile-infested Lake Victoria.&#91;28&#93; Word of his plan leaked out and a rebellion by Christians and Muslims together brought Mwanga's brother Kiweewa to the throne. In October 1888, the Muslims seized power, expelled the Christian leaders and, when Kiweewa refused to be circumcised, deposed and killed him, replacing him with another brother, Kalema. In December 1888, Mwanga won support from Christians and in April 1889 advanced against the Buganda capital. He was defeated, but the Christian forces, led by the Protestant chief Apollo Kaggwa, retook the capital, enabling Mwanga to enter it triumphantly on 11 October 1889. The Muslims took refuge in the neighbouring kingdom of Bunyoro, which helped them to return victoriously in November 1889, but they suffered a decisive defeat in February 1890 and withdrew again to Bunyoro.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93;
In 1888, Britain authorized the Imperial British East Africa Company to administer the East African territory assigned to Britain in its 1886 treaty with Germany. In November 1889, Mwanga asked the company's agent Frederick Jackson for help. Jackson hesitated to accept the request, because he had been given orders not to enter Buganda. Carl Peters, an agent of the corresponding German company, learning of Mwanga's appeal, decided to respond to it. He arrived at Mengo, Mwanga's new capital, a fortnight after the February 1890 defeat of the Muslims. Since these still presented a threat, Mwanga accepted his offer of a treaty. Jackson then arrived and offered a treaty, which Mwanga rejected, since even the English missionaries considered its terms too onerous.&#91;29&#93;
The agreement that Peters made with Mwanga was nullified by the 1 July 1890 treaty between Britain and Germany, which extended inland the line of division between their areas of influence in East Africa, leaving Buganda in the British sphere and moving the centre of interest from the coast to the hinterland.&#91;30&#93; The Imperial British East Africa Company sent Frederick Lugard, its military administrator, to Mengo, where in December 1890 he got Mwanga to accept for a period of two years an agreement with the company. This agreement was advantageous for Mwanga when the Muslims in Bunyoro made another attempt to recover power. Friction between the Catholic and the Protestant parties led to fighting in January 1892 in Mengo. Lugard supported the Protestants against the stronger Catholic side in the fighting, forcing Mwanga and the Catholics to flee. Lugard managed to persuade Mwanga to return from German territory, where he had taken refuge, to Mengo on 30 March 1892 and to make a new treaty. This treaty assigned separate areas to Protestants (the largest area), Catholics, and (only a small area) Muslims; Mwanga himself nominally became a Protestant.&#91;31&#93;
With the aid of the Church Missionary Society, which used the deaths of their martyrs to win broad public support in Britain for acquiring Uganda, Lugard then successfully dissuaded Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and his cabinet from abandoning Uganda.&#91;5&#93; The powers of the company were transferred to the British Crown on 1 April 1893 and on 27 August 1894 Mwanga accepted Buganda being made a British protectorate. However, on 6 July 1897 he declared war on the British. Defeated on 20 July in Buddu (in today's Masaka District), an area assigned to Catholics in the 1892 treaty, he again fled to German East Africa. He was declared deposed on 9 August. After a failed attempt to recover his kingdom, he was exiled in 1899 to the Seychelles, where he was received into the Anglican Church. He died in 1903, aged 35.&#91;32&#93;
Following the deaths, the Roman Catholic Church used the episode to make the victims the focus of a "cult of martyrs".&#91;15&#93;
In 1897 Archbishop Henri Streicher founded in Uganda the Uganda Martyrs Guild to participate in evangelization. Some chapters of the Guild became politicized in the 1950s. Under the influence of the Charismatic Movement, it later developed into an important anti-witchcraft movement in Tooro.&#91;15&#93;
The honour paid to the Uganda martyrs elsewhere in Africa serves to Africanize Catholicism, as for instance in Senegal, where a church built in 1890 contains their relics and where there are several churches dedicated to Kizito, the youngest of their number.&#91;15&#93;
Pope Benedict XV beatified Charles Lwanga and his companions on 6 June 1920, and Pope Paul VI canonized them on 18 October 1964.&#91;33&#93; In the ceremony of canonization of the Catholic martyrs, Pope Paul mentioned also the Anglicans, saying: "Nor, indeed, do we wish to forget the others who, belonging to the Anglican confession, confronted death in the name of Christ."&#91;34&#93; Their 3 June feast day is included in the General Roman Calendar. A set of postage stamps were issued in the following year by Vatican City for commemorating the canonization.&#91;35&#93;
The Basilica of the Uganda Martyrs at Namugongo was built in 1968. Since the 1980s it has become the venue of massive pilgrimages, and plans for large-scale expansion were announced in 2014.&#91;36&#93;
In 1993, the Uganda Episcopal Conference established a university named after the Uganda Martyrs, which received its civil charter in 2005.&#91;37&#93;
In 2014, Uganda celebrated 50 years since the Uganda Martyrs were canonized and elevated to sainthood by Pope Paul VI on 18 October 1964.&#91;38&#93; The Munyonyo Martyrs Shrine is a thanksgiving monument for their canonization. Official groundbreaking was on 3 May 2015 by the Papal Nuncio to Uganda, Archbishop Michael A. Blume, and Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala. Re-development includes construction of a new church shrine, museum, offices, and martyrdom spots of the saints.&#91;39&#93;
There were also two Ugandan martyrs of a later period, who died at Paimol in 1918 and were beatified in 2002.&#91;40&#93; These have not yet been canonized.
The martyrs Daudi Okelo and Jildo Irwa were two young catechists from Uganda. They belonged to the Acholi tribe, a subdivision of the large Luo group. They lived and were martyred in the years immediately following the founding of the mission of Kitgum by the Comboni Missionaries in 1915.&#91;41&#93;
When commemorating the martyrs of Uganda, the Church of England includes Archbishop Janani Luwum, who was murdered in 1977 by Idi Amin's henchmen; they also commemorate Luwum separately on 16 February.
The Ugandan Martyrs were featured in one episode of the film Millions.&#91;42&#93; In the DVD of the film it is mentioned that one of the actors who played the martyrs claimed to be a descendant of one of the martyrs.&#91;43&#93;

The Catholic Church, sometimes referred to as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with approximately 1.3 ;billion baptised Catholics worldwide as of 2018&#91;update&#93;.&#91;4&#93; As the world's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution,&#91;7&#93; it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilization.&#91;8&#93; The church is headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope. Its central administration is the Holy See.
The Christian beliefs of Catholicism are based the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission,&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;&#91;note 1&#93; that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles, and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ.&#91;13&#93; It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, reserving infallibility, passed down by sacred tradition.&#91;14&#93; The Latin Church, the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders, enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church.&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93;
Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass.&#91;17&#93; The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions.&#91;18&#93; Its teaching includes Divine Mercy, sanctification through faith and evangelization of the Gospel as well as Catholic social teaching, which emphasises voluntary support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world.&#91;19&#93;
The Catholic Church has influenced Western philosophy, culture, art, and science. Catholics live all over the world through missions, diaspora, and conversions. Since the 20th century the majority reside in the southern hemisphere due to secularization in Europe, and increased persecution in the Middle East.
The Catholic Church shared communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church until the East–West Schism in 1054, disputing particularly the authority of the pope. Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431 the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the Oriental Orthodox churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, all separating primarily over differences in Christology.  In the 16th century, the Reformation led to Protestantism also breaking away.
From the late 20th century the Catholic Church has been criticized for its teachings on sexuality, its absence of female priests, and its handling of sexual abuse cases involving clergy.
Catholic (from Greek: καθολικός, romanized: ;katholikos, lit. ;&#39;universal&#39;) was first used to describe the church in the early 2nd century.&#91;22&#93; The first known use of the phrase "the catholic church" (καθολικὴ ἐκκλησία he katholike ekklesia) occurred in the letter written about 110 AD from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans.&#91;note 2&#93; In the Catechetical Lectures (c.&#8201;350) of Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, the name "Catholic Church" was used to distinguish it from other groups that also called themselves "the church".&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93; The "Catholic" notion was further stressed in the edict De fide Catolica issued 380 by Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire, when establishing the state church of the Roman Empire.&#91;25&#93;
Since the East–West Schism of 1054, the Eastern Church has taken the adjective "Orthodox" as its distinctive epithet (however, its official name continues to be the "Orthodox Catholic Church"&#91;26&#93;) and the Western Church in communion with the Holy See has similarly taken "Catholic", keeping that description also after the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, when those who ceased to be in communion became known as "Protestants".&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;
While the "Roman Church" has been used to describe the pope's Diocese of Rome since the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and into the Early Middle Ages (6th–10th century), the "Roman Catholic Church" has been applied to the whole church in the English language since the Protestant Reformation in the late 16th century.&#91;29&#93; "Roman Catholic" has occasionally appeared also in documents produced both by the Holy See,&#91;note 3&#93; notably applied to certain national episcopal conferences, and local dioceses.&#91;note 4&#93;
The name "Catholic Church" for the whole church is used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1990) and the Code of Canon Law (1983). The name "Catholic Church" is also used in the documents of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965),&#91;30&#93; the First Vatican Council (1869–1870),&#91;31&#93; the Council of Trent (1545–1563),&#91;32&#93; and numerous other official documents.&#91;33&#93;&#91;34&#93;

The Catholic Church follows an episcopal polity, led by bishops who have received the sacrament of Holy Orders who are given formal jurisdictions of governance within the church.&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; There are three levels of clergy, the episcopate, composed of bishops who hold jurisdiction over a geographic area called a diocese or eparchy; the presbyterate, composed of priests ordained by bishops and who work in local diocese or religious orders; and the diaconate, composed of deacons who assist bishops and priests in a variety of ministerial roles. Ultimately leading the entire Catholic Church is the Bishop of Rome, commonly called the pope, whose jurisdiction is called the Holy See. In parallel to the diocesan structure are a variety of religious institutes that function autonomously, often subject only to the authority of the pope, though sometimes subject to the local bishop. Most religious institutes only have male or female members but some have both. Additionally, lay members aid many liturgical functions during worship services.
The hierarchy of the Catholic Church is headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope (Latin: papa; "father"), who is the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church.&#91;37&#93; The current pope, Francis, was elected on 13 March 2013 by papal conclave.&#91;38&#93;

The office of the pope is known as the papacy. The Catholic Church holds that Christ instituted the papacy upon giving the keys of Heaven to Saint Peter. His ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called the "Holy See" (Sancta Sedes in Latin), or the "Apostolic See" (meaning the see of the apostle Peter).&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; Directly serving the pope is the Roman Curia, the central governing body that administers the day-to-day business of the Catholic Church.
The pope is also Sovereign of Vatican City,&#91;41&#93; a small city-state entirely enclaved within the city of Rome, which is an entity distinct from the Holy See. It is as head of the Holy See, not as head of Vatican City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives.&#91;42&#93; The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals, such as the orders of chivalry originating from the Middle Ages.
While the famous Saint Peter's Basilica is located in Vatican City, above the traditional site of Saint Peter's tomb, the papal cathedral for the Diocese of Rome is the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, located within the city of Rome, though enjoying extraterritorial privileges accredited to the Holy See.
The position of cardinal is a rank of honour bestowed by popes on certain clerics, such as leaders within the Roman Curia, bishops serving in major cities and distinguished theologians. For advice and assistance in governing, the pope may turn to the College of Cardinals.&#91;43&#93;
Following the death or resignation of a pope,&#91;note 5&#93; members of the College of Cardinals who are under age 80 act as an electoral college, meeting in a papal conclave to elect a successor.&#91;45&#93; Although the conclave may elect any male Catholic as pope since 1389 only cardinals have been elected.&#91;46&#93;
Canon law (Latin: jus canonicum)&#91;47&#93; is the system of laws and legal principles made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities of the Catholic Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the church.&#91;48&#93; The canon law of the Latin Church was the first modern Western legal system&#91;49&#93; and is the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West,&#91;50&#93;&#91;51&#93; while the distinctive traditions of Oriental canon law govern the 23 Eastern Catholic particular churches sui iuris.
Positive ecclesiastical laws, based directly or indirectly upon immutable divine law or natural law, derive formal authority in the case of universal laws from promulgation by the supreme legislator—the Supreme Pontiff—who possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person,&#91;52&#93; while particular laws derive formal authority from promulgation by a legislator inferior to the supreme legislator, whether an ordinary or a delegated legislator. The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but all-encompassing of the human condition. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system:&#91;53&#93; laws, courts, lawyers, judges,&#91;53&#93; a fully articulated legal code for the Latin Church&#91;54&#93; as well as a code for the Eastern Catholic Churches,&#91;54&#93; principles of legal interpretation,&#91;55&#93; and coercive penalties.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;
Canon law concerns the Catholic Church's life and organization and is distinct from civil law. In its own field it gives force to civil law only by specific enactment in matters such as the guardianship of minors.&#91;58&#93; Similarly, civil law may give force in its field to canon law, but only by specific enactment, as with regard to canonical marriages.&#91;59&#93; Currently, the 1983 Code of Canon Law is in effect for the Latin Church.&#91;60&#93; The distinct 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.&#91;61&#93;

In the first thousand years of Catholic history, different varieties of Christianity developed in the Western and Eastern Christian areas of Europe. Though most Eastern-tradition churches are no longer in communion with the Catholic Church after the Great Schism of 1054, autonomous particular churches of both traditions currently participate, also known as "churches sui iuris" (Latin: "of one's own right"). The largest and most well known is the Latin Church, the only Western-tradition church, with more than 1 ;billion members worldwide. Relatively small in terms of adherents compared to the Latin Church, are the 23 self-governing Eastern Catholic Churches with a combined membership of 17.3 ;million as of 2010&#91;update&#93;.&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93;
The Latin Church is governed by the pope and diocesan bishops directly appointed by him. The pope exercises a direct patriarchal role over the Latin Church, which is considered to form the original and still major part of Western Christianity, a heritage of certain beliefs and customs originating in Europe and northwestern Africa, some of which are inherited by many Christian denominations that trace their origins to the Protestant Reformation.&#91;66&#93;
The Eastern Catholic Churches follow the traditions and spirituality of Eastern Christianity and are churches which have always remained in full communion with the Catholic Church or who have chosen to re-enter full communion in the centuries following the East–West Schism and earlier divisions. These churches are communities of Catholic Christians whose forms of worship reflect distinct historical and cultural influences rather than differences in doctrine.
A church sui iuris is defined in the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches as a "group of Christian faithful united by a hierarchy" that is recognised by the Pope in his capacity as the supreme authority on matters of doctrine within the church.&#91;67&#93; The term is an innovation of the CCEO to denote the relative autonomy of the Eastern Catholic Churches,&#91;68&#93; who remain in full communion with the Pope, but have governance structures and liturgical traditions separate from that of the Latin Church.&#91;63&#93; While the Latin Church's canons do not explicitly use the term, it is tacitly recognised as equivalent.
Some Eastern Catholic churches are governed by a patriarch who is elected by the synod of the bishops of that church,&#91;69&#93; others are headed by a major archbishop,&#91;70&#93; others are under a metropolitan,&#91;71&#93; and others are organized as individual eparchies.&#91;72&#93; Each church has authority over the particulars of its internal organization, liturgical rites, liturgical calendar and other aspects of its spirituality, subject only to the authority of the pope.&#91;73&#93; The Roman Curia has a specific department, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, to maintain relations with them.&#91;74&#93; The pope does not generally appoint bishops or clergy in the Eastern Catholic Churches, deferring to their internal governance structures, but may intervene if he feels it necessary.
Individual countries, regions, or major cities are served by particular churches known as dioceses in the Latin Church, or eparchies in the Eastern Catholic Churches, each overseen by a bishop. As of 2008&#91;update&#93;, the Catholic Church has 2,795 dioceses.&#91;76&#93; The bishops in a particular country are members of a national or regional episcopal conference.&#91;77&#93;
Dioceses are divided into parishes, each with one or more priests, deacons or lay ecclesial ministers.&#91;78&#93; Parishes are responsible for the day to day celebration of the sacraments and pastoral care of the laity.&#91;79&#93; As of 2016&#91;update&#93;, there are 221,700 parishes worldwide.&#91;80&#93;
In the Latin Church, Catholic men may serve as deacons or priests by receiving sacramental ordination. Men and women may serve as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, as readers (lectors), or as altar servers. Historically, boys and men have only been permitted to serve as altar servers; however, since the 1990s, girls and women have also been permitted.&#91;81&#93;&#91;note 6&#93;
Ordained Catholics, as well as members of the laity, may enter into consecrated life either on an individual basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin, or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience.&#91;82&#93; Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Legionaries of Christ and the Sisters of Mercy.&#91;82&#93;
"Religious institutes" is a modern term encompassing both "religious orders" and "religious congregations," which were once distinguished in canon law.&#91;83&#93; The terms "religious order" and "religious institute" tend to be used as synonyms colloquially.&#91;84&#93;
By means of Catholic charities and beyond, the Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and health care in the world.&#91;19&#93;
Catholicism is the world's second largest religious body after Sunni Islam.&#91;85&#93; Church membership, defined as baptised Catholics, was 1.329 ;billion at the end of 2018, which is 18% of the world population.&#91;4&#93; Catholics represent about half of all Christians.&#91;86&#93; 
Geographic distribution of Catholics worldwide continues to shift, with 17.8% in Africa, 48.3% in the Americas, 11.1% Asia, 21.5% in Europe, and 0.9% in Oceania.&#91;4&#93;
Catholic ministers include ordained clergy, lay ecclesial ministers, missionaries, and catechists. Also as of the end of 2014, there were 465,595 ordained clergy, including 5,237 bishops, 415,792 priests (diocesan and religious), and 44,566 deacons (permanent).&#91;87&#93; Non-ordained ministers included 3,157,568 catechists, 367,679 lay missionaries, and 39,951 lay ecclesial ministers.&#91;88&#93;
Catholics who have committed to religious or consecrated life instead of marriage or single celibacy, as a state of life or relational vocation, include 54,559 male religious, 705,529 women religious. These are not ordained, nor generally considered ministers unless also engaged in one of the lay minister categories above.&#91;87&#93;
Catholic doctrine has developed over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars. The church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached.&#91;89&#93;&#91;90&#93;
It teaches that revelation has one common source, God, and two distinct modes of transmission: Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition,&#91;91&#93;&#91;92&#93; and that these are authentically interpreted by the Magisterium.&#91;93&#93;&#91;94&#93; Sacred Scripture consists of the 73 books of the Catholic Bible, consisting of 46 Old Testament and 27 New Testament writings. Sacred Tradition consists of those teachings believed by the church to have been handed down since the time of the Apostles.&#91;95&#93; Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are collectively known as the "deposit of faith" (depositum fidei in Latin). These are in turn interpreted by the Magisterium (from magister, Latin for "teacher"), the church's teaching authority, which is exercised by the pope and the College of Bishops in union with the pope, the Bishop of Rome.&#91;96&#93; Catholic doctrine is authoritatively summarized in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, published by the Holy See.&#91;97&#93;&#91;98&#93;
The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God, who exists as a perichoresis ("mutual indwelling") of three hypostases, or "persons": God the Father; God the Son; and God the Holy Spirit, which together are called the "Holy Trinity".&#91;99&#93;
Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the "Second Person" of the Trinity, God the Son. In an event known as the Incarnation, through the power of the Holy Spirit, God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Christ, therefore, is understood as being both fully divine and fully human, including possessing a human soul. It is taught that Christ's mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels.&#91;100&#93; Jesus is believed to have remained sinless while on earth, and to have allowed himself to be unjustly executed by crucifixion, as a sacrifice of himself to reconcile humanity to God; this reconciliation is known as the Paschal Mystery.&#91;101&#93; The Greek term "Christ" and the Hebrew "Messiah" both mean "anointed one", referring to the Christian belief that Jesus' death and resurrection are the fulfilment of the Old Testament's messianic prophecies.&#91;102&#93;
The Catholic Church teaches dogmatically that "the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles but as from one single principle".&#91;103&#93; It holds that the Father, as the "principle without principle", is the first origin of the Spirit, but also that he, as Father of the only Son, is with the Son the single principle from which the Spirit proceeds.&#91;104&#93; This belief is expressed in the Filioque clause which was added to the Latin version of the Nicene Creed of 381 but not included in the Greek versions of the creed used in Eastern Christianity.&#91;105&#93;
The Catholic Church teaches that it is the "one true church",&#91;9&#93;&#91;106&#93; "the universal sacrament of salvation for the human race",&#91;107&#93;&#91;108&#93; and "the one true religion".&#91;109&#93; According to the Catechism, the Catholic Church is further described in the Nicene Creed as the "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church".&#91;110&#93; These are collectively known as the Four Marks of the Church. The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ.&#91;111&#93;&#91;112&#93; The New Testament records several events considered integral to the establishment of the Catholic Church, including Jesus' activities and teaching and his appointment of the apostles as witnesses to his ministry, suffering, and resurrection. The Great Commission, after his resurrection, instructed the apostles to continue his work. The coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, in an event known as Pentecost, is seen as the beginning of the public ministry of the Catholic Church.&#91;113&#93; The church teaches that all duly consecrated bishops have a lineal succession from the apostles of Christ, known as apostolic succession.&#91;114&#93; In particular, the Bishop of Rome (the pope) is considered the successor to the apostle Simon Peter, a position from which he derives his supremacy over the church.&#91;115&#93;
Catholic belief holds that the church "is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth"&#91;116&#93; and that it alone possesses the full means of salvation.&#91;117&#93; Through the passion (suffering) of Christ leading to his crucifixion as described in the Gospels, it is said Christ made himself an oblation to God the Father in order to reconcile humanity to God;&#91;118&#93; the Resurrection of Jesus makes him the firstborn from the dead, the first among many brethren.&#91;119&#93; By reconciling with God and following Christ's words and deeds, an individual can enter the Kingdom of God.&#91;120&#93; The church sees its liturgy and sacraments as perpetuating the graces achieved through Christ's sacrifice to strengthen a person's relationship with Christ and aid in overcoming sin.&#91;121&#93;
The Catholic Church teaches that, immediately after death, the soul of each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins and their relationship to Christ.&#91;122&#93;&#91;123&#93; This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.&#91;124&#93;
Depending on the judgement rendered following death, it is believed that a soul may enter one of three states of the afterlife:
While the Catholic Church teaches that it alone possesses the full means of salvation,&#91;117&#93; it also acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to "impel towards Catholic unity"&#91;133&#93; and "tend and lead toward the Catholic Church",&#91;133&#93; and thus bring people to salvation, because these separated communities contain some elements of proper doctrine, albeit admixed with errors. It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Catholic Church but that people can be saved outside of the ordinary means known as baptism of desire, and by pre-baptismal martyrdom, known as baptism of blood, as well as when conditions of invincible ignorance are present, although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation.&#91;134&#93;
A saint (also historically known as a hallow) is a person who is recognised as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness or closeness to God, while canonization is the act by which a Christian church declares that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the "canon", or list, of recognised saints.&#91;135&#93;&#91;136&#93; The first persons honoured as saints were the martyrs. Pious legends of their deaths were considered affirmations of the truth of their faith in Christ. By the fourth century, however, "confessors"—people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life—began to be venerated publicly.
In the Catholic Church, both in Latin and Eastern Catholic churches, the act of canonization is reserved to the Apostolic See and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that he is worthy to be recognised as a saint. The church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in Heaven and that he may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the liturgy of the church, including in the Litany of the Saints. Canonization allows universal veneration of the saint in the liturgy of the Roman Rite; for permission to venerate merely locally, only beatification is needed.&#91;137&#93;
Devotions are "external practices of piety" which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but are part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics.&#91;138&#93; These include various practices regarding the veneration of the saints, especially veneration of the Virgin Mary. Other devotional practices include the Stations of the Cross, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus,&#91;139&#93; the various scapulars, novenas to various saints,&#91;140&#93; pilgrimages&#91;141&#93; and devotions to the Blessed Sacrament,&#91;140&#93; and the veneration of saintly images such as the santos.&#91;142&#93; The bishops at the Second Vatican Council reminded Catholics that "devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonise with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them."&#91;143&#93;
Catholic Mariology deals with the doctrines and teachings concerning the life of the Mary, mother of Jesus, as well as the veneration of Mary by the faithful. Mary is held in special regard, declared the Mother of God (Greek: Θεοτόκος, romanized: ;Theotokos, lit. ;&#39;God-bearer&#39;), and believed as dogma to have remained a virgin throughout her life.&#91;144&#93; Further teachings include the doctrines of the Immaculate Conception (her own conception without the stain of original sin) and the Assumption of Mary (that her body was assumed directly into heaven at the end of her life). Both of these doctrines were defined as infallible dogma, by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and Pope Pius XII in 1950 respectively,&#91;145&#93; but only after consulting with the Catholic bishops throughout the world to ascertain that this is a Catholic belief.&#91;146&#93;
Devotions to Mary are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God.&#91;147&#93; Practices include prayers and Marian art, music, and architecture. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as Queen of Heaven. Pope Paul VI called her Mother of the Church because, by giving birth to Christ, she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the Body of Christ.&#91;145&#93; Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the Hail Mary, the Rosary, the Salve Regina and the Memorare are common Catholic practices.&#91;148&#93; Pilgrimage to the sites of several Marian apparitions affirmed by the church, such as Lourdes, Fátima, and Guadalupe,&#91;149&#93; are also popular Catholic devotions.&#91;150&#93;

The Catholic Church teaches that it was entrusted with seven sacraments that were instituted by Christ. The number and nature of the sacraments were defined by several ecumenical councils, most recently the Council of Trent.&#91;151&#93;&#91;note 7&#93; These are Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick (formerly called Extreme Unction, one of the "Last Rites"), Holy Orders and Holy Matrimony. Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's grace to all those who receive them with the proper disposition (ex opere operato).&#91;152&#93; The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorizes the sacraments into three groups, the "sacraments of Christian initiation", "sacraments of healing" and "sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful". These groups broadly reflect the stages of people's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve.&#91;153&#93;
The liturgies of the sacraments are central to the church's mission. According to the Catechism:
According to church doctrine, the sacraments of the church require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly celebrated.&#91;155&#93; In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments.&#91;156&#93; Notably, because the church teaches that Christ is present in the Eucharist,&#91;157&#93; those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance).&#91;158&#93; Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament.&#91;158&#93; Non-Catholics are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.&#91;156&#93;&#91;159&#93;
Catholics, even if they were in danger of death and unable to approach a Catholic minister, may not ask for the sacraments of the Eucharist, penance or anointing of the sick from someone, such as a Protestant minister, who is not known to be validly ordained in line with Catholic teaching on ordination.&#91;160&#93;&#91;161&#93; Likewise, even in grave and pressing need, Catholic ministers may not administer these sacraments to those who do not manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament. In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See, the Catholic Church is less restrictive, declaring that "a certain communion in sacris, and so in the Eucharist, given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged."&#91;162&#93;
As viewed by the Catholic Church, Baptism is the first of three sacraments of initiation as a Christian.&#91;163&#93; It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins.&#91;164&#93; It makes a person a member of the church.&#91;165&#93; As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit on the part of the person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children,&#91;166&#93; who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin.&#91;167&#93; If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child.&#91;168&#93; Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated.&#91;169&#93; The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.&#91;170&#93;
The Catholic Church sees the sacrament of confirmation as required to complete the grace given in baptism.&#91;171&#93; When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards,&#91;172&#93; a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches.&#91;173&#93; In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they are old enough to understand or at the bishop's discretion.&#91;174&#93; In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism,&#91;175&#93; a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop.&#91;175&#93;&#91;176&#93; Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by the sacrament of Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.&#91;177&#93;
For Catholics, the Eucharist is the sacrament which completes Christian initiation. It is described as "the source and summit of the Christian life".&#91;178&#93; The ceremony in which a Catholic first receives the Eucharist is known as First Communion.&#91;179&#93;
The Eucharistic celebration, also called the Mass or Divine liturgy, includes prayers and scriptural readings, as well as an offering of bread and wine, which are brought to the altar and consecrated by the priest to become the body and the blood of Jesus Christ, a change called transubstantiation.&#91;180&#93;&#91;note 8&#93; The words of consecration reflect the words spoken by Jesus during the Last Supper, where Christ offered his body and blood to his Apostles the night before his crucifixion. The sacrament re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross,&#91;181&#93; and perpetuates it. Christ's death and resurrection gives grace through the sacrament that unites the faithful with Christ and one another, remits venial sin, and aids against committing moral sin (though mortal sin itself is forgiven through the sacrament of penance).&#91;182&#93;
The two sacraments of healing are the Sacrament of Penance and Anointing of the Sick.
The Sacrament of Penance (also called Reconciliation, Forgiveness, Confession, and Conversion&#91;183&#93;) exists for the conversion of those who, after baptism, separate themselves from Christ by sin.&#91;184&#93; Essential to this sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and absolution).&#91;185&#93; Serious sins (mortal sins) should be confessed at least once a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of venial sins also is recommended.&#91;186&#93; The priest is bound under the severest penalties to maintain the "seal of confession", absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession.&#91;187&#93;
While chrism is used only for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a different oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, has begun to be in danger of death.&#91;188&#93; This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.&#91;189&#93;
The sacrament is also referred to as Unction, and in the past as Extreme Unction, and it is one of the three sacraments that constitute the last rites, together with Penance and Viaticum (Eucharist).&#91;190&#93;
According to the Catechism, there are two sacraments of communion directed towards the salvation of others: priesthood and marriage.&#91;191&#93; Within the general vocation to be a Christian, these two sacraments "consecrate to specific mission or vocation among the people of God. Men receive the holy orders to feed the Church by the word and grace. Spouses marry so that their love may be fortified to fulfil duties of their state".&#91;192&#93;
The sacrament of Holy Orders consecrates and deputes some Christians to serve the whole body as members of three degrees or orders: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons).&#91;193&#93;&#91;194&#93; The church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Church, the priesthood is generally restricted to celibate men, and the episcopate is always restricted to celibate men.&#91;195&#93; Men who are already married may be ordained in certain Eastern Catholic churches in most countries,&#91;196&#93; and the personal ordinariates and may become deacons even in the Western Church&#91;197&#93;&#91;198&#93; (see Clerical marriage). But after becoming a Catholic priest, a man may not marry (see Clerical celibacy) unless he is formally laicized.
All clergy, whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness marriages and conduct funeral liturgies.&#91;199&#93; Only bishops and priests can administer the sacraments of the Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing of the Sick.&#91;200&#93;&#91;201&#93; Only bishops can administer the sacrament of Holy Orders, which ordains someone into the clergy.&#91;202&#93;

The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is a social and spiritual bond between a man and a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death.&#91;203&#93;&#91;note 9&#93; The church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.&#91;206&#93;
The church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce only as a means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment.&#91;207&#93; Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.&#91;207&#93;
Among the 24 autonomous (sui iuris) churches, numerous liturgical and other traditions exist, called rites, which reflect historical and cultural diversity rather than differences in belief.&#91;208&#93; In the definition of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, "a rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual, and disciplinary patrimony, culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people, by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each Church sui iuris".&#91;209&#93;
The liturgy of the sacrament of the Eucharist, called the Mass in the West and Divine Liturgy or other names in the East, is the principal liturgy of the Catholic Church.&#91;210&#93; This is because it is considered the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ himself.&#91;211&#93; Its most widely used form is that of the Roman Rite as promulgated by Paul VI in 1969 and revised by Pope John Paul II in 2002. In certain circumstances, the 1962 form of the Roman Rite remains authorized in the Latin Church. Eastern Catholic Churches have their own rites. The liturgies of the Eucharist and the other sacraments vary from rite to rite, reflecting different theological emphases.
The Roman Rite is the most common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, originating in Rome and spreading throughout Europe, influencing and eventually supplanting local rites.&#91;212&#93; The present ordinary form of Mass in the Roman Rite, found in the post-1969 editions of the Roman Missal, is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, using an officially approved translation from the original text in Latin. An outline of its major liturgical elements can be found in the sidebar.
In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed the licitness of continued use of the 1962 Roman Missal as an "extraordinary form" (forma extraordinaria) of the Roman Rite, speaking of it also as an usus antiquior ("older use"), and issuing new more permissive norms for its employment.&#91;213&#93; An instruction issued four years later spoke of the two forms or usages of the Roman Rite approved by the pope as the ordinary form and the extraordinary form ("the forma ordinaria" and "the forma extraordinaria").&#91;214&#93;
The 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, published a few months before the Second Vatican Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardized in 1570 by Pope Pius V at the request of the Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass.&#91;157&#93; Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops;&#91;215&#93; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorized parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.&#91;216&#93;
Since 2014, clergy in the small personal ordinariates set up for groups of former Anglicans under the terms of the 2009 document Anglicanorum Coetibus&#91;217&#93; are permitted to use a variation of the Roman Rite called "Divine Worship" or, less formally, "Ordinariate Use",&#91;218&#93; which incorporates elements of the Anglican liturgy and traditions, &#91;note 10&#93; an accommodation protested by Anglican leaders.
In the Archdiocese of Milan, with around five million Catholics the largest in Europe,&#91;219&#93; Mass is celebrated according to the Ambrosian Rite. Other Latin Church rites include the Mozarabic&#91;220&#93; and those of some religious institutes.&#91;221&#93; These liturgical rites have an antiquity of at least 200 years before 1570, the date of Pope Pius V's Quo primum, and were thus allowed to continue.&#91;222&#93;
The Eastern Catholic Churches share common patrimony and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who are no longer in communion with the Holy See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never been out of communion with the Holy See or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition.&#91;223&#93;
The rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches include the Byzantine Rite, in its Antiochian, Greek and Slavonic varieties; the Alexandrian Rite; the Syriac Rite; the Armenian Rite; the Maronite Rite and the Chaldean Rite. Eastern Catholic Churches have the autonomy to set the particulars of their liturgical forms and worship, within certain limits to protect the "accurate observance" of their liturgical tradition.&#91;224&#93; In the past some of the rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches were subject to a degree of liturgical Latinization. However, in recent years Eastern Catholic Churches have returned to traditional Eastern practices in accord with the Vatican II decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum.&#91;225&#93; Each church has its own liturgical calendar.&#91;226&#93;
Catholic social teaching, reflecting the concern Jesus showed for the impoverished, places a heavy emphasis on the corporal works of mercy and the spiritual works of mercy, namely the support and concern for the sick, the poor and the afflicted.&#91;227&#93;&#91;228&#93; Church teaching calls for a preferential option for the poor while canon law prescribes that "The Christian faithful are also obliged to promote social justice and, mindful of the precept of the Lord, to assist the poor."&#91;229&#93; Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical letter Rerum novarum which upholds the rights and dignity of labour and the right of workers to form unions.
Catholic teaching regarding sexuality calls for a practice of chastity, with a focus on maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity.&#91;230&#93; Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.
The church has also addressed stewardship of the natural environment, and its relationship to other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming.&#91;231&#93; The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.&#91;232&#93;
The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of education and medical services in the world.&#91;19&#93; In 2010, the Catholic Church's Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers said that the church manages 26% of health care facilities in the world, including hospitals, clinics, orphanages, pharmacies and centres for those with leprosy.&#91;233&#93;
The church has always been involved in education, since the founding of the first universities of Europe. It runs and sponsors thousands of primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities throughout the world&#91;234&#93;&#91;235&#93; and operates the world's largest non-governmental school system.&#91;236&#93;
Religious institutes for women have played a particularly prominent role in the provision of health and education services,&#91;237&#93; as with orders such as the Sisters of Mercy, Little Sisters of the Poor, the Missionaries of Charity, the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul.&#91;238&#93; The Catholic nun Mother Teresa of Calcutta, India, founder of the Missionaries of Charity, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her humanitarian work among India's poor.&#91;239&#93; Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo won the same award in 1996 for "work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor".&#91;240&#93;
The church is also actively engaged in international aid and development through organizations such as Catholic Relief Services, Caritas International, Aid to the Church in Need, refugee advocacy groups such as the Jesuit Refugee Service and community aid groups such as the Saint Vincent de Paul Society.&#91;241&#93;

The Catholic Church calls all members to practise chastity according to their state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity for those who are not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.&#91;242&#93;
In the church's teaching, sexual activity is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians or in a natural marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, in order to test mutual respect and fidelity.&#91;243&#93; Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life;&#91;244&#93; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.&#91;245&#93;
Contraception and certain other sexual practices are not permitted, although natural family planning methods are permitted to provide healthy spacing between births, or to postpone children for a just reason.&#91;246&#93; Pope Francis said in 2015 that he is worried that the church has grown "obsessed" with issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage and contraception and has criticized the Catholic Church for placing dogma before love, and for prioritizing moral doctrines over helping the poor and marginalized.&#91;247&#93;&#91;248&#93;
Canon law makes no provision for divorce between baptised individuals, as a valid, consummated sacramental marriage is considered to be a lifelong bond.&#91;249&#93; However, a declaration of nullity may be granted when the proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent from the beginning—in other words, that the marriage was not valid due to some impediment. A declaration of nullity, commonly called an annulment, is a judgement on the part of an ecclesiastical tribunal determining that a marriage was invalidly attempted.&#91;250&#93; In addition, marriages among unbaptised individuals may be dissolved with papal permission under certain situations, such as a desire to marry a Catholic, under Pauline or Petrine privilege.&#91;204&#93;&#91;205&#93; An attempt at remarriage following divorce without a declaration of nullity places "the remarried spouse ... in a situation of public and permanent adultery". An innocent spouse who lives in continence following divorce, or couples who live in continence following a civil divorce for a grave cause, do not sin.&#91;251&#93;
Worldwide, diocesan tribunals completed over 49000 cases for nullity of marriage in 2006. Over the past 30 years about 55 to 70% of annulments have occurred in the United States. The growth in annulments has been substantial; in the United States, 27,000 marriages were annulled in 2006, compared to 338 in 1968. However, approximately 200,000 married Catholics in the United States divorce each year; 10 ;million total as of 2006&#91;update&#93;.&#91;252&#93;&#91;note 11&#93; Divorce is increasing in some predominantly Catholic countries in Europe.&#91;254&#93; In some predominantly Catholic countries, it is only in recent years that divorce was introduced (e.g. Italy (1970), Portugal (1975), Brazil (1977), Spain (1981), Ireland (1996), Chile (2004) and Malta (2011), while the Philippines and the Vatican City have no procedure for divorce. (The Philippines does, however, allow divorce for Muslims.)
The church teaches that sexual intercourse should only take place between a man and woman who are married to each other, and should be without the use of birth control or contraception. In his encyclical Humanae vitae&#91;255&#93; (1968), Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of natural family planning. This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a "culture of death" and calling instead for a "culture of life".&#91;256&#93;
Many Western Catholics have voiced significant disagreement with the church's teaching on contraception.&#91;257&#93; Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives at some point in their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the church's teaching on birth control.&#91;258&#93; Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty.&#91;note 12&#93; As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.&#91;261&#93;
Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes in vitro fertilization (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between a husband and wife.&#91;262&#93; In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as such.&#91;263&#93; For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.&#91;264&#93;
The Catholic Church also teaches that "homosexual acts" are "contrary to the natural law", "acts of grave depravity" and "under no circumstances can they be approved", but that persons experiencing homosexual tendencies must be accorded respect and dignity.&#91;265&#93; According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church,
This part of the Catechism was quoted by Pope Francis in a 2013 press interview in which he remarked, when asked about an individual:
This remark and others made in the same interview were seen as a change in the tone, but not in the substance of the teaching of the church,&#91;268&#93; which includes opposition to same-sex marriage.&#91;269&#93; Certain dissenting Catholic groups oppose the position of the Catholic Church and seek to change it.&#91;270&#93;
Women and men religious engage in a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries.&#91;237&#93;&#91;271&#93; While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles in the life of the church, with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing and running the church's worldwide health and education service networks.&#91;272&#93;
Efforts in support of the ordination of women to the priesthood led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or Popes against the proposal, as in Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood (1976), Mulieris Dignitatem (1988) and Ordinatio sacerdotalis (1994). According to the latest ruling, found in Ordinatio sacerdotalis, Pope John Paul II affirmed that the Catholic Church "does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination".&#91;273&#93; In defiance of these rulings, opposition groups such as Roman Catholic Womenpriests have performed ceremonies they affirm as sacramental ordinations (with, reputedly, an ordaining male Catholic bishop in the first few instances) which, according to canon law, are both illicit and invalid and considered mere simulations&#91;274&#93; of the sacrament of ordination.&#91;275&#93;&#91;note 13&#93; The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded by issuing a statement clarifying that any Catholic bishops involved in ordination ceremonies for women, as well as the women themselves if they were Catholic, would automatically receive the penalty of excommunication (latae sententiae, literally "with the sentence already applied", i.e. automatically), citing canon 1378 of canon law and other church laws.&#91;276&#93;
From the 1990s, the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy and other church members has become the subject of civil litigation, criminal prosecution, media coverage and public debate in countries around the world. The Catholic Church has been criticized for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences.
In response to the scandal, formal procedures have been established to help prevent abuse, encourage the reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness.&#91;277&#93; In 2014, Pope Francis instituted the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors for the safeguarding of minors.&#91;278&#93;
The Christian religion is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of Judea of the Roman Empire. Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus.&#91;9&#93; Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. Emperor Constantine legalized the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted Arian Christianity, eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.
In the 7th and 8th centuries, expanding Muslim conquests following the advent of Islam led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between Rome and the Byzantine Empire. Conflicts involving authority in the church, particularly the authority of the Bishop of Rome finally culminated in the East–West Schism in the 11th century, splitting the church into the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Earlier splits within the church occurred after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in communion with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the Eastern Catholic Churches.
Early monasteries throughout Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilization. The church eventually became the dominant influence in Western civilization into the modern age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, as well as in the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.
In 1870, the First Vatican Council declared the dogma of papal infallibility and the Kingdom of Italy annexed the city of Rome, the last portion of the Papal States to be incorporated into the new nation. In the 20th century, anti-clerical governments around the world, including Mexico and Spain, persecuted or executed thousands of clerics and laypersons. In the Second World War, the church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust; its efforts, however, have been criticized as inadequate. After the war, freedom of religion was severely restricted in the Communist countries newly aligned with the Soviet Union, several of which had large Catholic populations.
In the 1960s, the Second Vatican Council led to reforms of the church's liturgy and practices, described as "opening the windows" by defenders, but criticized by traditionalist Catholics. In the face of increased criticism from both within and without, the church has upheld or reaffirmed at various times controversial doctrinal positions regarding sexuality and gender, including limiting clergy to males, and moral exhortations against abortion, contraception, sexual activity outside of marriage, remarriage following divorce without annulment, and against same-sex marriage.
The New Testament, in particular the Gospels, records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the twelve Apostles and his Great Commission of the Apostles, instructing them to continue his work.&#91;112&#93;&#91;279&#93; The book Acts of Apostles, tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman empire.&#91;280&#93;  The Catholic Church teaches that its public ministry began on Pentecost, occurring fifty days following the date Christ is believed to have resurrected.&#91;113&#93; At Pentecost, the Apostles are believed to have received the Holy Spirit, preparing them for their mission in leading the church.&#91;281&#93;&#91;282&#93; The Catholic Church teaches that the college of bishops, led by the Bishop of Rome are the successors to the Apostles.&#91;283&#93;
In the account of the Confession of Peter found in the Gospel of Matthew, Christ designates Peter as the "rock" upon which Christ's church will be built.&#91;284&#93;&#91;285&#93; The Catholic Church considers the Bishop of Rome, the pope, to be the successor to Saint Peter.&#91;286&#93; Some scholars state Peter was the first Bishop of Rome.&#91;287&#93;&#91;note 14&#93; Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome.&#91;288&#93; Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters/bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century, when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted,&#91;289&#93; and that later writers retrospectively applied the term "bishop of Rome" to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself.&#91;289&#93; On this basis, Oscar Cullmann,&#91;290&#93; Henry Chadwick,&#91;291&#93; and Bart D. Ehrman&#91;292&#93; question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy. Raymond E. Brown also says that it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, but that Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having "roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church". These roles, Brown says, "contributed enormously to seeing the bishop of Rome, the bishop of the city where Peter died, and where Paul witnessed to the truth of Christ, as the successor of Peter in care for the church universal".&#91;289&#93;
Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the Pax Romana made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.&#91;293&#93;
Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see Idolatry). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century.&#91;294&#93;
In 313, Emperor Constantine I's Edict of Milan legalized Christianity, and in 330 Constantine moved the imperial capital to Constantinople, modern Istanbul, Turkey. In 380 the Edict of Thessalonica made Nicene Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire, a position that within the diminishing territory of the Byzantine Empire would persist until the empire itself ended in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, while elsewhere the church was independent of the empire, as became particularly clear with the East–West Schism. During the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, five primary sees emerged, an arrangement formalized in the mid-6th century by Emperor Justinian I as the pentarchy of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria.&#91;295&#93;&#91;296&#93; In 451 the Council of Chalcedon, in a canon of disputed validity,&#91;297&#93; elevated the see of Constantinople to a position "second in eminence and power to the bishop of Rome".&#91;298&#93; From c. 350 to c. 500, the bishops, or popes, of Rome, steadily increased in authority through their consistent intervening in support of orthodox leaders in theological disputes, which encouraged appeals to them.&#91;299&#93; Emperor Justinian, who in the areas under his control definitively established a form of caesaropapism,&#91;300&#93; in which "he had the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church",&#91;301&#93; reestablished imperial power over Rome and other parts of the West, initiating the period termed the Byzantine Papacy (537–752), during which the bishops of Rome, or popes, required approval from the emperor in Constantinople or from his representative in Ravenna for consecration, and most were selected by the emperor from his Greek-speaking subjects,&#91;302&#93; resulting in a "melting pot" of Western and Eastern Christian traditions in art as well as liturgy.&#91;303&#93;
Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its Arian form, which the Catholic Church declared heretical.&#91;304&#93; The resulting religious discord between Germanic rulers and Catholic subjects&#91;305&#93; was avoided when, in 497, Clovis I, the Frankish ruler, converted to orthodox Catholicism, allying himself with the papacy and the monasteries.&#91;306&#93; The Visigoths in Spain followed his lead in 589,&#91;307&#93; and the Lombards in Italy in the course of the 7th century.&#91;308&#93;
Western Christianity, particularly through its monasteries, was a major factor in preserving classical civilization, with its art (see Illuminated manuscript) and literacy.&#91;309&#93;&#91;310&#93; Through his Rule, Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–543), one of the founders of Western monasticism, exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Catholic Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as Columbanus and Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe.[1]

The Catholic Church was the dominant influence on Western civilization from Late Antiquity to the dawn of the modern age.&#91;8&#93; It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music.&#91;311&#93; Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Tintoretto, Titian, Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the church.&#91;312&#93; Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is "at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization".&#91;313&#93;
The massive Islamic invasions of the mid-7th century began a long struggle between Christianity and Islam throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The Byzantine Empire soon lost the lands of the eastern patriarchates of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Antioch and was reduced to that of Constantinople, the empire's capital. As a result of Islamic domination of the Mediterranean, the Frankish state, centred away from that sea, was able to evolve as the dominant power that shaped the Western Europe of the Middle Ages.&#91;314&#93; The battles of Toulouse and Poitiers halted the Islamic advance in the West and the failed Siege of Constantinople halted it in the East. Two or three decades later, in 751, the Byzantine Empire lost to the Lombards the city of Ravenna from which it governed the small fragments of Italy, including Rome, that acknowledged its sovereignty. The fall of Ravenna meant that confirmation by a no longer existent exarch was not asked for during the election in 752 of Pope Stephen II and that the papacy was forced to look elsewhere for a civil power to protect it.&#91;315&#93; In 754, at the urgent request of Pope Stephen, the Frankish king Pepin the Short conquered the Lombards. He then gifted the lands of the former exarchate to the pope, thus initiating the Papal States. Rome and the Byzantine East would delve into further conflict during the Photian schism of the 860s, when Photius criticized the Latin west of adding of the filioque clause after being excommunicated by Nicholas I. Though the schism was reconciled, unresolved issues would lead to further division.&#91;316&#93;
In the 11th century, the efforts of Hildebrand of Sovana led to the creation of the College of Cardinals to elect new popes, starting with Pope Alexander II in the papal election of 1061. When Alexander II died, Hildebrand was elected to succeed him, as Pope Gregory VII. The basic election system of the College of Cardinals which Gregory VII helped establish has continued to function into the 21st century. Pope Gregory VII further initiated the Gregorian Reforms regarding the independence of the clergy from secular authority. This led to the Investiture Controversy between the church and the Holy Roman Emperors, over which had the authority to appoint bishops and popes.&#91;317&#93;&#91;318&#93;
In 1095, Byzantine emperor Alexius I appealed to Pope Urban II for help against renewed Muslim invasions in the Byzantine–Seljuk Wars,&#91;319&#93; which caused Urban to launch the First Crusade aimed at aiding the Byzantine Empire and returning the Holy Land to Christian control.&#91;320&#93; In the 11th century, strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the Latin Church separated them in the East–West Schism, partially due to conflicts over papal authority. The Fourth Crusade and the sacking of Constantinople by renegade crusaders proved the final breach.&#91;321&#93; In this age great gothic cathedrals in France were an expression of popular pride in the Christian faith.
In the early 13th century mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán. The studia conventualia and studia generalia of the mendicant orders played a large role in the transformation of Church-sponsored cathedral schools and palace schools, such as that of Charlemagne at Aachen, into the prominent universities of Europe.&#91;322&#93; Scholastic theologians and philosophers such as the Dominican priest Thomas Aquinas studied and taught at these studia. Aquinas' Summa Theologica was an intellectual milestone in its synthesis of the legacy of Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle with the content of Christian revelation.&#91;323&#93;
A growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France&#91;324&#93; during a period known as the Avignon Papacy. The Avignon Papacy ended in 1376 when the pope returned to Rome,&#91;325&#93; but was followed in 1378 by the 38-year-long Western schism, with claimants to the papacy in Rome, Avignon and (after 1409) Pisa.&#91;325&#93; The matter was largely resolved in 1415–17 at the Council of Constance, with the claimants in Rome and Pisa agreeing to resign and the third claimant excommunicated by the cardinals, who held a new election naming Martin V pope.&#91;326&#93;
In 1438, the Council of Florence convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuniting the Catholic and Orthodox churches.&#91;327&#93; Several eastern churches reunited, forming the majority of the Eastern Catholic Churches.&#91;328&#93;
The Age of Discovery beginning in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, as well as by the transformation of societies through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. Pope Alexander VI had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal&#91;329&#93; and the ensuing patronato system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies.&#91;330&#93; In 1521 the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan made the first Catholic converts in the Philippines.&#91;331&#93; Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized in India, China, and Japan.&#91;332&#93; The French colonization beginning in the 16th century established a Roman Catholic francophone population and forbade non-Catholics to settle in New France. (now Canada)&#91;333&#93;&#91;334&#93;&#91;335&#93;
In 1415, Jan Hus was burned at the stake for heresy, but his reform efforts encouraged Martin Luther, an Augustinian monk in Germany, who sent his Ninety-five Theses to several bishops in 1517.&#91;336&#93; His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences, and along with the Leipzig Debate this led to his excommunication in 1521.&#91;336&#93;&#91;337&#93; In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the Reformation, which gave birth to the great majority of Protestant denominations&#91;338&#93; and also crypto-Protestantism within the Catholic Church.&#91;339&#93; Meanwhile, Henry VIII petitioned the pope for a declaration of nullity concerning his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. When this was denied, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed to make him head of the Church of England, spurring the English Reformation and the eventual development of Anglicanism.&#91;340&#93;
The Reformation contributed to clashes between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the Peace of Augsburg but continued tensions produced a far graver conflict—the Thirty Years' War—which broke out in 1618.&#91;341&#93; In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots (French Calvinists) and the forces of the French Catholic League, which were backed and funded by a series of popes.&#91;342&#93; This ended under Pope Clement VIII, who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes granting civil and religious toleration to French Protestants.&#91;341&#93;&#91;342&#93;
The Council of Trent (1545–1563) became the driving force behind the Counter-Reformation in response to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation.&#91;343&#93; In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world, in part through missionaries and imperialism, although its hold on European populations declined due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.&#91;344&#93;
From the 17th century onward, the Enlightenment questioned the power and influence of the Catholic Church over Western society.&#91;345&#93; In the 18th century, writers such as Voltaire and the Encyclopédistes wrote biting critiques of both religion and the Catholic Church. One target of their criticism was the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV of France, which ended a century-long policy of religious toleration of Protestant Huguenots. As the papacy resisted pushes for Gallicanism, the French Revolution of 1789 shifted power to the state, caused the destruction of churches, the establishment of a Cult of Reason,&#91;346&#93; and the martyrdom of nuns during the Reign of Terror.&#91;347&#93; In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte's General Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded the Italian Peninsula, imprisoning Pope Pius VI, who died in captivity. Napoleon later re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801.&#91;348&#93; The end of the Napoleonic Wars brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States.&#91;349&#93;
In 1854, Pope Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception as a Dogma in the Catholic Church.&#91;350&#93; In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements,&#91;351&#93;&#91;352&#93; striking a blow to the rival position of conciliarism. Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church,&#91;353&#93;
The Italian unification of the 1860s incorporated the Papal States, including Rome itself from 1870, into the Kingdom of Italy, thus ending the papacy's temporal power. In response, Pope Pius IX excommunicated King Victor Emmanuel II, refused payment for the land, and rejected the Italian Law of Guarantees, which granted him special privileges. To avoid placing himself in visible subjection to the Italian authorities, he remained a "prisoner in the Vatican".&#91;354&#93; This stand-off, which was spoken of as the Roman Question, was resolved by the 1929 Lateran Treaties, whereby the Holy See acknowledged Italian sovereignty over the former Papal States in return for payment and Italy's recognition of papal sovereignty over Vatican City as a new sovereign and independent state.&#91;355&#93;
A number of anti-clerical governments emerged in the 20th century.
The 1926 Calles Law separating church and state in Mexico led to the Cristero War&#91;356&#93; in which more than 3,000 ;priests were exiled or assassinated,&#91;357&#93; churches desecrated, services mocked, nuns raped, and captured priests shot.&#91;356&#93; Following the 1917 October Revolution, persecution of the church and Catholics in the Soviet Union continued into the 1930s, with the execution and exiling of clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of religious implements, and closure of churches.&#91;358&#93;&#91;359&#93; In the 1936–39 Spanish Civil War, the Catholic hierarchy allied with Franco's Nationalists against the Popular Front government,&#91;360&#93; citing as justification Republican violence against the church.&#91;361&#93;&#91;362&#93; Pope Pius XI referred to these three countries as a "terrible triangle".&#91;363&#93;&#91;364&#93;
After violations of the 1933 Reichskonkordat between the church and Nazi Germany, Pope Pius XI issued the 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge, which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the church and their ideology of neo-paganism and racial superiority.&#91;365&#93;&#91;366&#93;&#91;367&#93; The church condemned the 1939 Invasion of Poland that started World War II and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions.&#91;368&#93; Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein.&#91;369&#93; While Pope Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust,&#91;370&#93;&#91;371&#93; the church has also been accused of having encouraged centuries of antisemitism by its teachings&#91;372&#93; and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.&#91;373&#93;
During the post-war period, Communist governments in Eastern Europe severely restricted religious freedoms.&#91;374&#93; Although some priests and religious people collaborated with Communist regimes,&#91;375&#93; many others were imprisoned, deported, or executed. The church was an important player in the fall of Communism in Europe, particularly in the Polish People's Republic.&#91;376&#93;
In 1949, the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries.&#91;377&#93; The new government also created the Patriotic Church and appointed its bishops. These appointments were initially rejected by Rome before many of them were accepted.&#91;378&#93; In the 1960s during the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Communists closed all religious establishments. When Chinese churches eventually reopened, they remained under the control of the Patriotic Church. Many Catholic pastors and priests continued to be sent to prison for refusing to renounce allegiance to Rome.&#91;379&#93;
The Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent, four centuries before.&#91;380&#93; Initiated by Pope John XXIII, this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the vernacular (local language) and encouraging "fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations".&#91;381&#93; It intended to engage the church more closely with the present world (aggiornamento), which was described by its advocates as an "opening of the windows".&#91;382&#93; In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the church's approach to ecumenism,&#91;383&#93; and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially Judaism, in its document Nostra aetate.&#91;384&#93;
The council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms: proponents of the "Spirit of Vatican II" such as Swiss theologian Hans Küng said that Vatican II had "not gone far enough" to change church policies.&#91;385&#93; Traditionalist Catholics, such as Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, however, strongly criticized the council, arguing that its liturgical reforms led "to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments", among other issues.&#91;386&#93;
Several teachings of the Catholic Church came under increased scrutiny both concurrent with and following the council; among those teachings was the church's teaching regarding the immorality of contraception. The recent introduction of hormonal contraception (including "the pill"), which were believed by some to be morally different from previous methods, prompted John XXIII to form a committee to advise him of the moral and theological issues with the new method.&#91;387&#93;&#91;388&#93; Pope Paul VI later expanded the committee's scope to freely examine all methods, and the committee's unreleased final report was rumoured to suggest permitting at least some methods of contraception. Paul did not agree with the arguments presented, and eventually issued Humanae vitae, saying that it upheld the constant teaching of the church against contraception. It expressly included hormonal methods as prohibited.&#91;note 15&#93; This document generated a largely negative response from many Catholics.&#91;from whom?&#93;&#91;389&#93;
In 1978, Pope John Paul II, formerly Archbishop of Kraków in the Polish People's Republic, became the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His 26 1/2-year pontificate was one of the longest in history.&#91;390&#93; Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, credited the Polish pope with hastening the fall of Communism in Europe.&#91;391&#93;
John Paul II sought to evangelize an increasingly secular world. He instituted World Youth Day as a "worldwide encounter with the pope" for young people; it is now held every two to three years.&#91;392&#93; He travelled more than any other pope, visiting 129 countries,&#91;393&#93; and used television and radio as means of spreading the church's teachings. He also emphasised the dignity of work and natural rights of labourers to have fair wages and safe conditions in Laborem exercens.&#91;394&#93; He emphasised several church teachings, including moral exhortations against abortion, euthanasia, and against widespread use of the death penalty, in Evangelium Vitae.&#91;395&#93;
From the late 20th century, the Catholic Church has been criticized for its doctrines on sexuality, its inability to ordain women, and its handling of sexual abuse cases.
In 2005, following the death of John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under John Paul, was elected. He was known for upholding traditional Christian values against secularization,&#91;396&#93; and for increasing use of the Tridentine Mass as found in the Roman Missal of 1962.&#91;397&#93; In 2012, the 50th anniversary of Vatican II, an assembly of the Synod of Bishops discussed re-evangelising lapsed Catholics in the developed world.&#91;398&#93; Citing the frailties of advanced age, Benedict resigned in 2013, the first pope to do so in nearly 600 years.&#91;399&#93;
Pope Francis, the current Pope of the Catholic Church, succeeded Pope Benedict XVI in 2013 as the first pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first Pope from outside Europe since the Syrian Gregory III, who reigned in the 8th century. Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, concern for the poor and the environment, as well as his commitment to interfaith dialogue. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors.
Pope Francis is recognised for his efforts "to further close the nearly 1,000-year estrangement with the Orthodox Churches".&#91;400&#93; His installation was attended by Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople of the Eastern Orthodox Church,&#91;401&#93; the first time since the Great Schism of 1054 that the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople has attended a papal installation.&#91;402&#93; On 12 February 2016, Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the largest Eastern Orthodox church, met in Havana, Cuba, issuing a joint declaration calling for restored Christian unity between the two churches. This was reported as the first such high-level meeting between the two churches since the Great Schism of 1054.&#91;403&#93;
In 2014, the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops addressed the church's ministry towards families and marriages and to Catholics in "irregular" relationships, such as those who divorced and remarried outside of the church without a declaration of nullity.&#91;404&#93;&#91;405&#93; While welcomed by some, it was criticized by some for perceived ambiguity, provoking controversies among individual representatives of differing perspectives.&#91;406&#93;
In 2017 during a visit in Egypt, Pope Francis reestablished mutual recognition of baptism with the Coptic Orthodox Church.&#91;407&#93;


Anglicanism is a Western Christian tradition that has developed from the practices, liturgy, and identity of the Church of England following the English Reformation.&#91;1&#93;
Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans, or Episcopalians in some countries. The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion,&#91;2&#93; which forms the third-largest Christian communion in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.&#91;3&#93; They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury, whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares (Latin, "first among equals"). He calls the decennial Lambeth Conference, chairs the meeting of primates, and is the president of the Anglican Consultative Council.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by it also call themselves Anglican, including those that are within the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment.&#91;6&#93;
Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible, traditions of the apostolic Church, apostolic succession ("historic episcopate"), and the writings of the Church Fathers.&#91;1&#93; Anglicanism forms one of the branches of Western Christianity, having definitively declared its independence from the Holy See at the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement.&#91;7&#93; Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary Protestantism. These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them, Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions, namely Lutheranism and Calvinism.&#91;8&#93;
In the first half of the 17th century, the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition, with theologies, structures, and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way, or via media, between Protestantism and Catholicism – a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as "Catholic and Reformed".&#91;9&#93; The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion. Unique to Anglicanism is the Book of Common Prayer, the collection of services in one Book used for centuries. The Book is acknowledged as a principal tie that binds the Anglican Communion together as a liturgical rather than a confessional tradition or one possessing a magisterium as in the Roman Catholic Church.
After the American Revolution, Anglican congregations in the United States and British North America (which would later form the basis for the modern country of Canada) were each reconstituted into autonomous churches with their own bishops and self-governing structures; these were known as the American Episcopal Church and the Church of England in the Dominion of Canada. Through the expansion of the British Empire and the activity of Christian missions, this model was adopted as the model for many newly formed churches, especially in Africa, Australasia, and Asia-Pacific. In the 19th century, the term Anglicanism was coined to describe the common religious tradition of these churches; as also that of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which, though originating earlier within the Church of Scotland, had come to be recognised as sharing this common identity.
The word Anglican originates in Anglicana ecclesia libera sit, a phrase from the Magna Carta dated 15 June 1215, meaning "the Anglican Church shall be free".&#91;10&#93; Adherents of Anglicanism are called Anglicans. As an adjective, "Anglican" is used to describe the people, institutions, and churches, as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the Church of England.&#91;5&#93;
As a noun, an Anglican is a member of a church in the Anglican Communion. The word is also used by followers of separated groups which have left the communion or have been founded separately from it, although this is considered as a misuse by the Anglican Communion. The word Anglicanism came into being in the 19th century.&#91;5&#93; The word originally referred only to the teachings and rites of Christians throughout the world in communion with the see of Canterbury, but has come to sometimes be extended to any church following those traditions rather than actual membership in the modern Anglican Communion.&#91;5&#93;
Although the term Anglican is found referring to the Church of England as far back as the 16th century, its use did not become general until the latter half of the 19th century. In British parliamentary legislation referring to the English Established Church, there is no need for a description; it is simply the Church of England, though the word "Protestant" is used in many legal acts specifying the succession to the Crown and qualifications for office. When the Union with Ireland Act created the United Church of England and Ireland, it is specified that it shall be one "Protestant Episcopal Church", thereby distinguishing its form of church government from the Presbyterian polity that prevails in the Church of Scotland.&#91;11&#93;
The word Episcopal is preferred in the title of the Episcopal Church (the province of the Anglican Communion covering the United States) and the Scottish Episcopal Church, though the full name of the former is The Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America. Elsewhere, however, the term "Anglican Church" came to be preferred as it distinguished these churches from others that maintain an episcopal polity.
Anglicanism, in its structures, theology, and forms of worship, is commonly understood as a distinct Christian tradition representing a middle ground between what are perceived to be the extremes of the claims of 16th-century Roman Catholicism and the Lutheran and Reformed varieties of Protestantism of that era. As such, it is often referred to as being a via media (or "middle way") between these traditions.&#91;12&#93;
The faith of Anglicans is founded in the Scriptures and the Gospels, the traditions of the Apostolic Church, the historical episcopate, the first four ecumenical councils,&#91;13&#93; and the early Church Fathers (among these councils, especially the premier four ones,&#91;13&#93; and among these Fathers, especially those active during the five initial centuries of Christianity, according to the quinquasaecularist principle proposed by the English bishop Lancelot Andrewes and the Lutheran dissident Georg Calixtus). Anglicans understand the Old and New Testaments as "containing all things necessary for salvation" and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.&#91;14&#93; Reason and tradition are seen as valuable means to interpret scripture (a position first formulated in detail by Richard Hooker), but there is no full mutual agreement among Anglicans about exactly how scripture, reason, and tradition interact (or ought to interact) with each other.&#91;15&#93; Anglicans understand the Apostles' Creed as the baptismal symbol and the Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.
Anglicans believe the catholic and apostolic faith is revealed in Holy Scripture and the Catholic creeds and interpret these in light of the Christian tradition of the historic church, scholarship, reason, and experience.&#91;16&#93;
Anglicans celebrate the traditional sacraments, with special emphasis being given to the Eucharist, also called Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper or the Mass. The Eucharist is central to worship for most Anglicans as a communal offering of prayer and praise in which the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ are proclaimed through prayer, reading of the Bible, singing, giving God thanks over the bread and wine for the innumerable benefits obtained through the passion of Christ, the breaking of the bread, the blessing of the cup, and the partaking of the body and blood of Christ as instituted at the Last Supper, however one wished to define the Presence. The consecrated bread and wine which are the true body and blood of Christ after a spiritual manner (not in a crude physical way) are outward symbols of an inner grace given by Christ, which to the repentant conveys forgiveness and cleaning from sin. While many Anglicans celebrate the Eucharist in similar ways to the predominant western Catholic tradition, a considerable degree of liturgical freedom is permitted, and worship styles range from the simple to elaborate.
Unique to Anglicanism is the Book of Common Prayer (BCP), the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches have used for centuries. It was called common prayer originally because it was intended for use in all Church of England churches, which had previously followed differing local liturgies. The term was kept when the church became international, because all Anglicans used to share in its use around the world.
In 1549, the first Book of Common Prayer was compiled by Thomas Cranmer, who was then Archbishop of Canterbury. While it has since undergone many revisions and Anglican churches in different countries have developed other service books, the Prayer Book is still acknowledged as one of the ties that bind Anglicans together.
The founding of Christianity in Britain is commonly attributed to Joseph of Arimathea, according to Anglican legend, and is commemorated in Glastonbury Abbey.&#91;a&#93;&#91;18&#93; Many of the early Church Fathers wrote of the presence of Christianity in Roman Britain, with Tertullian stating "those parts of Britain into which the Roman arms had never penetrated were become subject to Christ".&#91;19&#93; Saint Alban, who was executed in AD 209, is the first Christian martyr in the British Isles. For this reason he is venerated as the British protomartyr.&#91;20&#93; The historian Heinrich Zimmer writes that "Just as Britain was a part of the Roman Empire, so the British Church formed (during the fourth century) a branch of the Catholic Church of the West; and during the whole of that century, from the Council of Arles (316) onward, took part in all proceedings concerning the Church."&#91;21&#93;
After Roman troops withdrew from Britain, the "absence of Roman military and governmental influence and overall decline of Roman imperial political power enabled Britain and the surrounding isles to develop distinctively from the rest of the West. A new culture emerged around the Irish Sea among the Celtic peoples with Celtic Christianity at its core. What resulted was a form of Christianity distinct from Rome in many traditions and practices."&#91;b&#93;&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;
The historian Charles Thomas, in addition to the Celticist Heinrich Zimmer, writes that the distinction between sub-Roman and post-Roman Insular Christianity, also known as Celtic Christianity, began to become apparent around AD 475,&#91;26&#93; with the Celtic churches allowing married clergy,&#91;27&#93; observing Lent and Easter according to their own calendar,&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93; and having a different tonsure; moreover, like the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Celtic churches operated independently of the Pope's authority,&#91;30&#93; as a result of their isolated development in the British Isles.&#91;31&#93;
In what is known as the Gregorian mission, Pope Gregory I sent Augustine of Canterbury to the British Isles in AD 596, with the purpose of evangelising the pagans there (who were largely Anglo-Saxons),&#91;32&#93; as well as to reconcile the Celtic churches in the British Isles to the See of Rome.&#91;33&#93; In Kent, Augustine persuaded the Anglo-Saxon king "Æthelberht and his people to accept Christianity".&#91;34&#93; Augustine, on two occasions, "met in conference with members of the Celtic episcopacy, but no understanding was reached between them."&#91;35&#93;
Eventually, the "Christian Church of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria convened the Synod of Whitby in 663/664 to decide whether to follow Celtic or Roman usages." This meeting, with King Oswiu as the final decision maker, "led to the acceptance of Roman usage elsewhere in England and brought the English Church into close contact with the Continent".&#91;36&#93; As a result of assuming Roman usages, the Celtic Church surrendered its independence, and, from this point on, the Church in England "was no longer purely Celtic, but became Anglo-Roman-Celtic".&#91;37&#93; The theologian Christopher L. Webber writes that, although "the Roman form of Christianity became the dominant influence in Britain as in all of western Europe, Anglican Christianity has continued to have a distinctive quality because of its Celtic heritage."&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;
The Church in England remained united with Rome until the English Parliament, through the Act of Supremacy (1534), declared King Henry VIII to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England to fulfill the "English desire to be independent from continental Europe religiously and politically." Although now separate from Rome, the English Church, at this point in history, continued to maintain Roman Catholic doctrines and the sacraments. With little exception, Henry VIII allowed no changes during his lifetime.&#91;41&#93; Under King Edward VI (1547–1553), however, the church in England underwent what is known as the English Reformation, in the course of which it acquired a number of characteristics that would subsequently become recognised as constituting its distinctive "Anglican" identity.&#91;42&#93;
With the Elizabethan Settlement of 1559, the Protestant identity of the English and Irish churches was affirmed by means of parliamentary legislation which mandated allegiance and loyalty to the English Crown in all their members. The Elizabethan church began to develop distinct religious traditions, assimilating some of the theology of Reformed churches with the services in the Book of Common Prayer (which drew extensively on the Sarum Rite native to England), under the leadership and organisation of a continuing episcopate.&#91;43&#93; Over the years, these traditions themselves came to command adherence and loyalty. The Elizabethan Settlement stopped the radical Protestant tendencies under Edward VI by combining the more radical elements of the Second Prayer Book of 1552 with the conservative "Catholic" First Prayer Book of 1549. From then on, Protestantism was in a "state of arrested development", regardless of the attempts to detach the Church of England from its "idiosyncratic anchorage in the medieval past" by various groups which tried to push it towards a more Reformed theology and governance in the years 1560–1660.&#91;44&#93;
Although two important constitutive elements of what later would emerge as Anglicanism were present in 1559 – scripture, the historic episcopate, the Book of Common Prayer, the teachings of the First Four Ecumenical Councils as the yardstick of catholicity, the teaching of the Church Fathers and Catholic bishops, and informed reason – neither the laypeople nor the clergy perceived themselves as Anglicans at the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign, as there was no such identity. Neither does the term via media appear until the 1627 to describe a church which refused to identify itself definitely as Catholic or Protestant, or as both, "and had decided in the end that this is virtue rather than a handicap".&#91;45&#93;
Historical studies on the period 1560–1660 written before the late 1960s tended to project the predominant conformist spirituality and doctrine of the 1660s on the ecclesiastical situation one hundred years before, and there was also a tendency to take polemically binary partitions of reality claimed by contestants studied (such as the dichotomies Protestant-"Popish" or "Laudian"-"Puritan") at face value. Since the late 1960s, these interpretations have been criticised. Studies on the subject written during the last forty-five years have, however, not reached any consensus on how to interpret this period in English church history. The extent to which one or several positions concerning doctrine and spirituality existed alongside the more well-known and articulate Puritan movement and the Durham House Party, and the exact extent of continental Calvinism among the English elite and among the ordinary churchgoers from the 1560s to the 1620s are subjects of current and ongoing debate.&#91;c&#93;
In 1662, under King Charles II, a revised Book of Common Prayer was produced, which was acceptable to high churchmen as well as some Puritans, and is still considered authoritative to this day.&#91;46&#93;
In so far as Anglicans derived their identity from both parliamentary legislation and ecclesiastical tradition, a crisis of identity could result wherever secular and religious loyalties came into conflict – and such a crisis indeed occurred in 1776 with the American Declaration of Independence, most of whose signatories were, at least nominally, Anglican.&#91;47&#93; For these American patriots, even the forms of Anglican services were in doubt, since the Prayer Book rites of Matins, Evensong, and Holy Communion all included specific prayers for the British Royal Family. Consequently, the conclusion of the War of Independence eventually resulted in the creation of two new Anglican churches, the Episcopal Church in the United States in those states that had achieved independence; and in the 1830s The Church of England in Canada became independent from the Church of England in those North American colonies which had remained under British control and to which many Loyalist churchmen had migrated.&#91;48&#93;
Reluctantly, legislation was passed in the British Parliament (the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786) to allow bishops to be consecrated for an American church outside of allegiance to the British Crown (since no dioceses had ever been established in the former American colonies).&#91;48&#93; Both in the United States and in Canada, the new Anglican churches developed novel models of self-government, collective decision-making, and self-supported financing; that would be consistent with separation of religious and secular identities.&#91;49&#93;
In the following century, two further factors acted to accelerate the development of a distinct Anglican identity. From 1828 and 1829, Dissenters and Catholics could be elected to the House of Commons,&#91;50&#93; which consequently ceased to be a body drawn purely from the established churches of Scotland, England, and Ireland; but which nevertheless, over the following ten years, engaged in extensive reforming legislation affecting the interests of the English and Irish churches; which, by the Acts of Union of 1800, had been reconstituted as the United Church of England and Ireland. The propriety of this legislation was bitterly contested by the Oxford Movement (Tractarians),&#91;51&#93; who in response developed a vision of Anglicanism as religious tradition deriving ultimately from the ecumenical councils of the patristic church. Those within the Church of England opposed to the Tractarians, and to their revived ritual practices, introduced a stream of bills in parliament aimed to control innovations in worship.&#91;52&#93; This only made the dilemma more acute, with consequent continual litigation in the secular and ecclesiastical courts.
Over the same period, Anglican churches engaged vigorously in Christian missions, resulting in the creation, by the end of the century, of over ninety colonial bishoprics,&#91;53&#93; which gradually coalesced into new self-governing churches on the Canadian and American models. However, the case of John Colenso, Bishop of Natal, reinstated in 1865 by the English Judicial Committee of the Privy Council over the heads of the Church in South Africa,&#91;54&#93; demonstrated acutely that the extension of episcopacy had to be accompanied by a recognised Anglican ecclesiology of ecclesiastical authority, distinct from secular power.
Consequently, at the instigation of the bishops of Canada and South Africa, the first Lambeth Conference was called in 1867;&#91;55&#93; to be followed by further conferences in 1878 and 1888, and thereafter at ten-year intervals. The various papers and declarations of successive Lambeth Conferences have served to frame the continued Anglican debate on identity, especially as relating to the possibility of ecumenical discussion with other churches. This ecumenical aspiration became much more of a possibility, as other denominational groups rapidly followed the example of the Anglican Communion in founding their own transnational alliances: the Alliance of Reformed Churches, the Ecumenical Methodist Council, the International Congregational Council, and the Baptist World Alliance.
Anglicanism was seen as a middle way, or via media, between two branches of Protestantism, Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity.&#91;56&#93; In their rejection of absolute parliamentary authority, the Tractarians – and in particular John Henry Newman – looked back to the writings of 17th-century Anglican divines, finding in these texts the idea of the English church as a via media between the Protestant and Catholic traditions.&#91;57&#93; This view was associated – especially in the writings of Edward Bouverie Pusey – with the theory of Anglicanism as one of three "branches" (alongside the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church) historically arising out of the common tradition of the earliest ecumenical councils. Newman himself subsequently rejected his theory of the via media, as essentially historicist and static and hence unable to accommodate any dynamic development within the church.&#91;57&#93; Nevertheless, the aspiration to ground Anglican identity in the writings of the 17th-century divines and in faithfulness to the traditions of the Church Fathers reflects a continuing theme of Anglican ecclesiology, most recently in the writings of Henry Robert McAdoo.&#91;58&#93;
The Tractarian formulation of the theory of the via media between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism was essentially a party platform, and not acceptable to Anglicans outside the confines of the Oxford Movement. However, this theory of the via media was reworked in the ecclesiological writings of Frederick Denison Maurice, in a more dynamic form that became widely influential. Both Maurice and Newman saw the Church of England of their day as sorely deficient in faith; but whereas Newman had looked back to a distant past when the light of faith might have appeared to burn brighter, Maurice looked forward to the possibility of a brighter revelation of faith in the future. Maurice saw the Protestant and Catholic strands within the Church of England as contrary but complementary, both maintaining elements of the true church, but incomplete without the other; such that a true catholic and evangelical church might come into being by a union of opposites.&#91;59&#93;
Central to Maurice's perspective was his belief that the collective elements of family, nation, and church represented a divine order of structures through which God unfolds his continuing work of creation. Hence, for Maurice, the Protestant tradition had maintained the elements of national distinction which were amongst the marks of the true universal church, but which had been lost within contemporary Roman Catholicism in the internationalism of centralised papal authority. Within the coming universal church that Maurice foresaw, national churches would each maintain the six signs of Catholicity: baptism, Eucharist, the creeds, Scripture, an episcopal ministry, and a fixed liturgy (which could take a variety of forms in accordance with divinely ordained distinctions in national characteristics).&#91;57&#93; Not surprisingly, this vision of a becoming universal church as a congregation of autonomous national churches proved highly congenial in Anglican circles; and Maurice's six signs were adapted to form the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral of 1888.&#91;60&#93;
In the latter decades of the 20th century, Maurice's theory, and the various strands of Anglican thought that derived from it, have been criticised by Stephen Sykes,&#91;61&#93; who argues that the terms Protestant and Catholic as used in these approaches are synthetic constructs denoting ecclesiastic identities unacceptable to those to whom the labels are applied. Hence, the Catholic Church does not regard itself as a party or strand within the universal church – but rather identifies itself as the universal church. Moreover, Sykes criticises the proposition, implicit in theories of via media, that there is no distinctive body of Anglican doctrines, other than those of the universal church; accusing this of being an excuse not to undertake systematic doctrine at all.&#91;62&#93;
Contrariwise, Sykes notes a high degree of commonality in Anglican liturgical forms and in the doctrinal understandings expressed within those liturgies. He proposes that Anglican identity might rather be found within a shared consistent pattern of prescriptive liturgies, established and maintained through canon law, and embodying both a historic deposit of formal statements of doctrine, and also framing the regular reading and proclamation of scripture.&#91;63&#93; Sykes nevertheless agrees with those heirs of Maurice who emphasise the incompleteness of Anglicanism as a positive feature, and quotes with qualified approval the words of Michael Ramsey:
The distinction between Reformed and Catholic, and the coherence of the two, is a matter of debate within the Anglican Communion. The Oxford Movement of the mid-19th century revived and extended doctrinal, liturgical, and pastoral practices similar to those of Roman Catholicism. This extends beyond the ceremony of high-church services to even more theologically significant territory, such as sacramental theology (see Anglican sacraments). While Anglo-Catholic practices, particularly liturgical ones, have become more common within the tradition over the last century, there are also places where practices and beliefs resonate more closely with the evangelical movements of the 1730s (see Sydney Anglicanism).
For high-church Anglicans, doctrine is neither established by a magisterium, nor derived from the theology of an eponymous founder (such as Calvinism), nor summed up in a confession of faith beyond the ecumenical creeds (such as the Lutheran Book of Concord). For them, the earliest Anglican theological documents are its prayer books, which they see as the products of profound theological reflection, compromise, and synthesis. They emphasise the Book of Common Prayer as a key expression of Anglican doctrine. The principle of looking to the prayer books as a guide to the parameters of belief and practice is called by the Latin name lex orandi, lex credendi ("the law of prayer is the law of belief").
Within the prayer books are the fundamentals of Anglican doctrine: the Apostles' and Nicene creeds, the Athanasian Creed (now rarely used), the scriptures (via the lectionary), the sacraments, daily prayer, the catechism, and apostolic succession in the context of the historic threefold ministry. For some low-church and evangelical Anglicans, the 16th-century Reformed Thirty-Nine Articles form the basis of doctrine.
The Thirty-Nine Articles played a significant role in Anglican doctrine and practice. Following the passing of the 1604 canons, all Anglican clergy had to formally subscribe to the articles. Today, however, the articles are no longer binding,&#91;65&#93; but are seen as a historical document which has played a significant role in the shaping of Anglican identity. The degree to which each of the articles has remained influential varies.
On the doctrine of justification, for example, there is a wide range of beliefs within the Anglican Communion, with some Anglo-Catholicss arguing for a faith with good works and the sacraments. At the same time, however, some evangelical Anglicans ascribe to the Reformed emphasis on sola fide ("faith alone") in their doctrine of justification (see Sydney Anglicanism). Still other Anglicans adopt a nuanced view of justification, taking elements from the early Church Fathers, Catholicism, Protestantism, liberal theology, and latitudinarian thought.
Arguably, the most influential of the original articles has been Article VI on the "sufficiency of scripture", which says that "Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation." This article has informed Anglican biblical exegesis and hermeneutics since earliest times.
Anglicans look for authority in their "standard divines" (see below). Historically, the most influential of these – apart from Cranmer – has been the 16th-century cleric and theologian Richard Hooker, who after 1660 was increasingly portrayed as the founding father of Anglicanism. Hooker's description of Anglican authority as being derived primarily from scripture, informed by reason (the intellect and the experience of God) and tradition (the practices and beliefs of the historical church), has influenced Anglican self-identity and doctrinal reflection perhaps more powerfully than any other formula. The analogy of the "three-legged stool" of scripture, reason, and tradition is often incorrectly attributed to Hooker. Rather, Hooker's description is a hierarchy of authority, with scripture as foundational and reason and tradition as vitally important, but secondary, authorities.
Finally, the extension of Anglicanism into non-English cultures, the growing diversity of prayer books, and the increasing interest in ecumenical dialogue have led to further reflection on the parameters of Anglican identity. Many Anglicans look to the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral of 1888 as the sine qua non of communal identity.&#91;66&#93; In brief, the quadrilateral's four points are the scriptures as containing all things necessary to salvation; the creeds (specifically, the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds) as the sufficient statement of Christian faith; the dominical sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion; and the historic episcopate.&#91;66&#93;
Within the Anglican tradition, "divines" are clergy of the Church of England whose theological writings have been considered standards for faith, doctrine, worship, and spirituality, and whose influence has permeated the Anglican Communion in varying degrees through the years.&#91;67&#93;&#91;full citation needed&#93; While there is no authoritative list of these Anglican divines, there are some whose names would likely be found on most lists – those who are commemorated in lesser feasts of the Anglican churches and those whose works are frequently anthologised.&#91;68&#93;
The corpus produced by Anglican divines is diverse. What they have in common is a commitment to the faith as conveyed by scripture and the Book of Common Prayer, thus regarding prayer and theology in a manner akin to that of the Apostolic Fathers.&#91;69&#93; On the whole, Anglican divines view the via media of Anglicanism not as a compromise, but as "a positive position, witnessing to the universality of God and God's kingdom working through the fallible, earthly ecclesia Anglicana".&#91;70&#93;
These theologians regard scripture as interpreted through tradition and reason as authoritative in matters concerning salvation. Reason and tradition, indeed, is extant in and presupposed by scripture, thus implying co-operation between God and humanity, God and nature, and between the sacred and secular. Faith is thus regarded as incarnational and authority as dispersed.
Amongst the early Anglican divines of the 16th and 17th centuries, the names of Thomas Cranmer, John Jewel, Matthew Parker, Richard Hooker, Lancelot Andrewes, and Jeremy Taylor predominate. The influential character of Hooker's Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity cannot be overestimated. Published in 1593 and subsequently, Hooker's eight-volume work is primarily a treatise on church-state relations, but it deals comprehensively with issues of biblical interpretation, soteriology, ethics, and sanctification. Throughout the work, Hooker makes clear that theology involves prayer and is concerned with ultimate issues and that theology is relevant to the social mission of the church.
The 18th century saw the rise of two important movements in Anglicanism: Cambridge Platonism, with its mystical understanding of reason as the "candle of the Lord", and the evangelical revival, with its emphasis on the personal experience of the Holy Spirit. The Cambridge Platonist movement evolved into a school called Latitudinarianism, which emphasised reason as the barometer of discernment and took a stance of indifference towards doctrinal and ecclesiological differences.
The evangelical revival, influenced by such figures as John Wesley and Charles Simeon, re-emphasised the importance of justification through faith and the consequent importance of personal conversion. Some in this movement, such as Wesley and George Whitefield, took the message to the United States, influencing the First Great Awakening and creating an Anglo-American movement called Methodism that would eventually break away, structurally, from the Anglican churches after the American Revolution.
By the 19th century, there was a renewed interest in pre-Reformation English religious thought and practice. Theologians such as John Keble, Edward Bouverie Pusey, and John Henry Newman had widespread influence in the realm of polemics, homiletics and theological and devotional works, not least because they largely repudiated the old high-church tradition and replaced it with a dynamic appeal to antiquity which looked beyond the Reformers and Anglican formularies.&#91;71&#93; Their work is largely credited with the development of the Oxford Movement, which sought to reassert Catholic identity and practice in Anglicanism.&#91;72&#93;
In contrast to this movement, clergy such as the Bishop of Liverpool, J. C. Ryle, sought to uphold the distinctly Reformed identity of the Church of England. He was not a servant of the status quo, but argued for a lively religion which emphasised grace, holy and charitable living, and the plain use of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (interpreted in a partisan evangelical way)&#91;d&#93; without additional rituals. Frederick Denison Maurice, through such works as The Kingdom of Christ, played a pivotal role in inaugurating another movement, Christian socialism. In this, Maurice transformed Hooker's emphasis on the incarnational nature of Anglican spirituality to an imperative for social justice.
In the 19th century, Anglican biblical scholarship began to assume a distinct character, represented by the so-called "Cambridge triumvirate" of Joseph Lightfoot, F. J. A. Hort, and Brooke Foss Westcott. Their orientation is best summed up by Lightfoot's observation that "Life which Christ is and which Christ communicates, the life which fills our whole beings as we realise its capacities, is active fellowship with God."&#91;citation needed&#93;
The earlier part of the 20th century is marked by Charles Gore, with his emphasis on natural revelation, and William Temple's focus on Christianity and society, while, from outside England, Robert Leighton, Archbishop of Glasgow, and several clergy from the United States have been suggested, such as William Porcher DuBose, John Henry Hobart (1775–1830, Bishop of New York 1816–30), William Meade, Phillips Brooks, and Charles Brent.&#91;73&#93;
Churchmanship can be defined as the manifestation of theology in the realms of liturgy, piety and, to some extent, spirituality. Anglican diversity in this respect has tended to reflect the diversity in the tradition's Reformed and Catholic identity. Different individuals, groups, parishes, dioceses and provinces may identify more closely with one or the other, or some mixture of the two.
The range of Anglican belief and practice became particularly divisive during the 19th century, when some clergy were disciplined and even imprisoned on charges of introducing illegal ritual while, at the same time, others were criticised for engaging in public worship services with ministers of Reformed churches. Resistance to the growing acceptance and restoration of traditional Catholic ceremonial by the mainstream of Anglicanism ultimately led to the formation of small breakaway churches such as the Free Church of England in England (1844) and the Reformed Episcopal Church in North America (1873).&#91;74&#93;&#91;75&#93;
Anglo-Catholic (and some broad-church) Anglicans celebrate public liturgy in ways that understand worship to be something very special and of utmost importance. Vestments are worn by the clergy, sung settings are often used, and incense may be used. Nowadays, in most Anglican churches, the Eucharist is celebrated in a manner similar to the usage of Roman Catholics and some Lutherans, though, in many churches, more traditional, "pre–Vatican II" models of worship are common (e.g., an "eastward orientation" at the altar). Whilst many Anglo-Catholics derive much of their liturgical practice from that of the pre-Reformation English church, others more closely follow traditional Roman Catholic practices.
The Eucharist may sometimes be celebrated in the form known as High Mass, with a priest, deacon and subdeacon (usually actually a layperson) dressed in traditional vestments, with incense and sanctus bells and prayers adapted from the Roman Missal or other sources by the celebrant. Such churches may also have forms of eucharistic adoration such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. In terms of personal piety, some Anglicans may recite the Rosary and Angelus, be involved in a devotional society dedicated to "Our Lady" (the Blessed Virgin Mary) and seek the intercession of the saints.
In recent decades, the prayer books of several provinces have, out of deference to a greater agreement with Eastern Conciliarism (and a perceived greater respect accorded Anglicanism by Eastern Orthodoxy than by Roman Catholicism), instituted a number of historically Eastern and Oriental Orthodox elements in their liturgies, including introduction of the Trisagion and deletion of the filioque clause from the Nicene Creed.
For their part, those evangelical (and some broad-church) Anglicans who emphasise the more Protestant aspects of the Church stress the Reformation theme of salvation by grace through faith. They emphasise the two dominical sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist, viewing the other five as "lesser rites". Some evangelical Anglicans may even tend to take the inerrancy of scripture literally, adopting the view of Article VI that it contains all things necessary to salvation in an explicit sense. Worship in churches influenced by these principles tends to be significantly less elaborate, with greater emphasis on the Liturgy of the Word (the reading of the scriptures, the sermon, and the intercessory prayers).
The Order for Holy Communion may be celebrated bi-weekly or monthly (in preference to the daily offices), by priests attired in choir habit, or more regular clothes, rather than Eucharistic vestments. Ceremony may be in keeping with their view of the provisions of the 17th-century Puritans – being a Reformed interpretation of the Ornaments Rubric – no candles, no incense, no bells, and a minimum of manual actions by the presiding celebrant (such as touching the elements at the Words of Institution).
In recent decades, there has been a growth of charismatic worship among Anglicans. Both Anglo-Catholics and evangelicals have been affected by this movement such that it is not uncommon to find typically charismatic postures, music, and other themes evident during the services of otherwise Anglo-Catholic or evangelical parishes.
The spectrum of Anglican beliefs and practice is too large to be fit into these labels. Many Anglicans locate themselves somewhere in the spectrum of the broad-church tradition and consider themselves an amalgam of evangelical and Catholic. Such Anglicans stress that Anglicanism is the via media (middle way) between the two major strains of Western Christianity and that Anglicanism is like a "bridge" between the two strains.
In accord with its prevailing self-identity as a via media or "middle path" of Western Christianity, Anglican sacramental theology expresses elements in keeping with its status as being both a church in the Catholic tradition as well as a Reformed church. With respect to sacramental theology, the Catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance Anglicanism places on the sacraments as a means of grace, sanctification, and salvation, as expressed in the church's liturgy and doctrine.
Of the seven sacraments, all Anglicans recognise Baptism and the Eucharist as being directly instituted by Christ. The other five – Confession/Absolution, Matrimony, Confirmation, Holy Orders (also called Ordination), and Anointing of the Sick (also called Unction) – are regarded variously as full sacraments by Anglo-Catholics and many high-church and some broad-church Anglicans, but merely as "sacramental rites" by other broad-church and low-church Anglicans, especially evangelicals associated with Reform UK and the Diocese of Sydney.
Anglican eucharistic theology is divergent in practice, reflecting the essential comprehensiveness of the tradition. A few low-church Anglicans take a strictly memorialist (Zwinglian) view of the sacrament. In other words, they see Holy Communion as a memorial to Christ's suffering, and participation in the Eucharist as both a re-enactment of the Last Supper and a foreshadowing of the heavenly banquet – the fulfilment of the eucharistic promise.
Other low-church Anglicans believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist but deny that the presence of Christ is carnal or is necessarily localised in the bread and wine. Despite explicit criticism in the Thirty-Nine Articles, many high-church or Anglo-Catholic Anglicans hold, more or less, the Catholic view of the real presence as expressed in the doctrine of transubstantiation, seeing the Eucharist as a liturgical representation of Christ's atoning sacrifice with the elements actually transformed into Christ's body and blood.
The majority of Anglicans, however, have in common a belief in the real presence, defined in one way or another. To that extent, they are in the company of the continental reformer Martin Luther and Calvin rather than Ulrich Zwingli. The Catechism of the American BCP of 1976 repeats the standard Anglican view ("The outward and visible sign in the Eucharist is the bread and wine"..."The inward and spiritual grace in the Holy Communion is the Body and Blood of Christ given to his people, and received by faith") without further definition. It should be remembered that Anglicanism has no official doctrine on this matter, believing it is wiser to leave the Presence a mystery. The faithful can believe privately whatever explanation they favor, be it transubstantiation, consubstantiation, receptionism, or virtualism (the two most congenial to Anglicans for centuries until the Oxford Movement), each of which espouses belief in the real presence in one way or another, or memorialism, which has never been an option with Anglicans.
A famous Anglican aphorism regarding Christ's presence in the sacrament, commonly misattributed to Queen Elizabeth I, is first found in print in a poem by John Donne:&#91;76&#93;
An Anglican position on the eucharistic sacrifice ("Sacrifice of the Mass") was expressed in the response Saepius officio of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to Pope Leo XIII's Papal Encyclical Apostolicae curae: viz. that the Prayer Book contained a strong sacrificial theology. Later revisions of the Prayer Book influenced by the Scottish Canon of 1764 first adopted by the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1789 made this assertion quite evident: "we do make and celebrate before thy Divine Majesty with these thy holy gifts, which we now OFFER unto thee, the memorial thy Son has commanded us to make", which is repeated in the 1929 English BCP and included in such words or others such as "present" or "show forth" in subsequent revisions.
Anglican and Roman Catholic representatives declared that they had "substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist" in the Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation (1971)&#91;78&#93; and the Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement (1979). The final response (1991) to these documents by the Vatican made it plain that it did not consider the degree of agreement reached to be satisfactory.
In Anglicanism, there is a distinction between liturgy, which is the formal public and communal worship of the Church, and personal prayer and devotion, which may be public or private. Liturgy is regulated by the prayer books and consists of the Holy Eucharist (some call it Holy Communion or Mass), the other six Sacraments, and the Divine Office or Liturgy of the Hours.
The Book of Common Prayer (BCP) is the foundational prayer book of Anglicanism. The original book of 1549 (revised in 1552) was one of the instruments of the English Reformation, replacing the various "uses" or rites in Latin that had been used in different parts of the country with a single compact volume in the language of the people, so that "now from henceforth all the Realm shall have but one use". Suppressed under Queen Mary I, it was revised in 1559, and then again in 1662, after the Restoration of Charles II. This version was made mandatory in England and Wales by the Act of Uniformity and was in standard use until the mid-20th century.
With British colonial expansion from the 17th century onwards, Anglican churches were planted around the globe. These churches at first used and then revised the Book of Common Prayer until they, like their parent church, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, which come under the general heading of the Liturgical Movement.
Anglican worship services are open to all visitors. Anglican worship originates principally in the reforms of Thomas Cranmer, who aimed to create a set order of service like that of the pre-Reformation church but less complex in its seasonal variety and said in English rather than Latin. This use of a set order of service is not unlike the Catholic tradition. Traditionally, the pattern was that laid out in the Book of Common Prayer. Although many Anglican churches now use a wide range of modern service books written in the local language, the structures of the Book of Common Prayer are largely retained. Churches which call themselves Anglican will have identified themselves so because they use some form or variant of the Book of Common Prayer in the shaping of their worship.
Anglican worship, however, is as diverse as Anglican theology. A contemporary "low-church" service may differ little from the worship of many mainstream non-Anglican Protestant churches. The service is constructed around a sermon focused on Biblical exposition and opened with one or more Bible readings and closed by a series of prayers (both set and extemporised) and hymns or songs. A "high-church" or Anglo-Catholic service, by contrast, is usually a more formal liturgy celebrated by clergy in distinctive vestments and may be almost indistinguishable from a Roman Catholic service, often resembling the "pre–Vatican II" Tridentine rite.
Between these extremes are a variety of styles of worship, often involving a robed choir and the use of the organ to accompany the singing and to provide music before and after the service. Anglican churches tend to have pews or chairs, and it is usual for the congregation to kneel for some prayers but to stand for hymns and other parts of the service such as the Gloria, Collect, Gospel reading, Creed and either the Preface or all of the Eucharistic Prayer. Anglicans may genuflect or cross themselves in the same way as Roman Catholics.
Other more traditional Anglicans tend to follow the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, and retain the use of the King James Bible. This is typical in many Anglican cathedrals and particularly in Royal Peculiars such as the Savoy Chapel and the Queen's Chapel. These services reflect older Anglican liturgies and differ from the Traditional Anglican Communion in that they are in favour of women priests and the ability of clergy to marry. These Anglican church services include classical music instead of songs, hymns from the New English Hymnal (usually excluding modern hymns such as "Lord of the Dance"), and are generally non-evangelical and formal in practice.
Until the mid-20th century the main Sunday service was typically morning prayer, but the Eucharist has once again become the standard form of Sunday worship in many Anglican churches; this again is similar to Roman Catholic practice. Other common Sunday services include an early morning Eucharist without music, an abbreviated Eucharist following a service of morning prayer, and a service of evening prayer, sometimes in the form of sung Evensong, usually celebrated between 3 and 6 pm. The late-evening service of Compline was revived in parish use in the early 20th century. Many Anglican churches will also have daily morning and evening prayer, and some have midweek or even daily celebration of the Eucharist.
An Anglican service (whether or not a Eucharist) will include readings from the Bible that are generally taken from a standardised lectionary, which provides for much of the Bible (and some passages from the Apocrypha) to be read out loud in the church over a cycle of one, two, or three years (depending on which eucharistic and office lectionaries are used, respectively). The sermon (or homily) is typically about ten to twenty minutes in length, often comparably short to sermons in evangelical churches. Even in the most informal Anglican services, it is common for set prayers such as the weekly Collect to be read. There are also set forms for intercessory prayer, though this is now more often extemporaneous. In high and Anglo-Catholic churches there are generally prayers for the dead.
Although Anglican public worship is usually ordered according to the canonically approved services, in practice many Anglican churches use forms of service outside these norms. Liberal churches may use freely structured or experimental forms of worship, including patterns borrowed from ecumenical traditions such as those of the Taizé Community or the Iona Community.
Anglo-Catholic parishes might use the modern Roman Catholic liturgy of the Mass or more traditional forms, such as the Tridentine Mass (which is translated into English in the English Missal), the Anglican Missal, or, less commonly, the Sarum Rite. Catholic devotions such as the Rosary, Angelus, and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament are also common among Anglo-Catholics.
Only baptised persons are eligible to receive communion,&#91;79&#93; although in many churches communion is restricted to those who have not only been baptised but also confirmed. In many Anglican provinces, however, all baptised Christians are now often invited to receive communion and some dioceses have regularised a system for admitting baptised young people to communion before they are confirmed.
The discipline of fasting before communion is practised by some Anglicans. Most Anglican priests require the presence of at least one other person for the celebration of the Eucharist (referring back to Christ's statement in Matthew 18:20, "When two or more are gathered in my name, I will be in the midst of them."), though some Anglo-Catholic priests (like Roman Catholic priests) may say private Masses. As in the Roman Catholic Church, it is a canonical requirement to use fermented wine for communion.
Unlike in Roman Catholicism, the consecrated bread and wine are always offered to the congregation at a eucharistic service ("communion in both kinds"). This practice is becoming more frequent in the Roman Catholic Church as well, especially through the Neocatechumenal Way. In some churches, the sacrament is reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry with a lighted candle or lamp nearby. In Anglican churches, only a priest or a bishop may be the celebrant at the Eucharist.
All Anglican prayer books contain offices for Morning Prayer (Matins) and Evening Prayer (Evensong). In the original Book of Common Prayer, these were derived from combinations of the ancient monastic offices of Matins and Lauds; and Vespers and Compline, respectively. The prayer offices have an important place in Anglican history.
Prior to the Catholic revival of the 19th century, which eventually restored the Holy Eucharist as the principal Sunday liturgy, and especially during the 18th century, a morning service combining Matins, the Litany, and ante-Communion comprised the usual expression of common worship, while Matins and Evensong were sung daily in cathedrals and some collegiate chapels. This nurtured a tradition of distinctive Anglican chant applied to the canticles and psalms used at the offices (although plainsong is often used as well).
In some official and many unofficial Anglican service books, these offices are supplemented by other offices such as the Little Hours of Prime and prayer during the day such as (Terce, Sext, None, and Compline). Some Anglican monastic communities have a Daily Office based on that of the Book of Common Prayer but with additional antiphons and canticles, etc., for specific days of the week, specific psalms, etc. See, for example, Order of the Holy Cross&#91;80&#93; and Order of St Helena, editors, A Monastic Breviary (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow, 1976). The All Saints Sisters of the Poor,&#91;81&#93; with convents in Catonsville, Maryland, and elsewhere, use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The Society of St. Francis publishes Celebrating Common Prayer, which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.
In England, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and some other Anglican provinces, the modern prayer books contain four offices:
In addition, most prayer books include a section of prayers and devotions for family use. In the US, these offices are further supplemented by an "Order of Worship for the Evening", a prelude to or an abbreviated form of Evensong, partly derived from Orthodox prayers. In the United Kingdom, the publication of Daily Prayer, the third volume of Common Worship, was published in 2005. It retains the services for Morning and Evening Prayer and Compline and includes a section entitled "Prayer during the Day". A New Zealand Prayer Book of 1989 provides different outlines for Matins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as "Midday Prayer", "Night Prayer" and "Family Prayer".
Some Anglicans who pray the office on daily basis use the present Divine Office of the Roman Catholic Church. In many cities, especially in England, Anglican and Roman Catholic priests and lay people often meet several times a week to pray the office in common. A small but enthusiastic minority use the Anglican Breviary, or other translations and adaptations of the pre–Vatican II Roman Rite and Sarum Rite, along with supplemental material from cognate western sources, to provide such things as a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women, and other additional material. Others may privately use idiosyncratic forms borrowed from a wide range of Christian traditions.
In the late medieval period, many English cathedrals and monasteries had established small choirs of trained lay clerks and boy choristers to perform polyphonic settings of the Mass in their Lady chapels. Although these "Lady Masses" were discontinued at the Reformation, the associated musical tradition was maintained in the Elizabethan Settlement through the establishment of choral foundations for daily singing of the Divine Office by expanded choirs of men and boys. This resulted from an explicit addition by Elizabeth herself to the injunctions accompanying the 1559 Book of Common Prayer (that had itself made no mention of choral worship) by which existing choral foundations and choir schools were instructed to be continued, and their endowments secured. Consequently, some thirty-four cathedrals, collegiate churches, and royal chapels maintained paid establishments of lay singing men and choristers in the late 16th century.&#91;82&#93;
All save four of these have – with an interruption during the Commonwealth – continued daily choral prayer and praise to this day. In the Offices of Matins and Evensong in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, these choral establishments are specified as "Quires and Places where they sing".
For nearly three centuries, this round of daily professional choral worship represented a tradition entirely distinct from that embodied in the intoning of Parish Clerks, and the singing of "west gallery choirs" which commonly accompanied weekly worship in English parish churches. In 1841, the rebuilt Leeds Parish Church established a surpliced choir to accompany parish services, drawing explicitly on the musical traditions of the ancient choral foundations. Over the next century, the Leeds example proved immensely popular and influential for choirs in cathedrals, parish churches, and schools throughout the Anglican communion.&#91;83&#93; More or less extensively adapted, this choral tradition also became the direct inspiration for robed choirs leading congregational worship in a wide range of Christian denominations.
In 1719, the cathedral choirs of Gloucester, Hereford, and Worcester combined to establish the annual Three Choirs Festival, the precursor for the multitude of summer music festivals since. By the 20th century, the choral tradition had become for many the most accessible face of worldwide Anglicanism – especially as promoted through the regular broadcasting of choral evensong by the BBC; and also in the annual televising of the festival of Nine Lessons and Carols from King's College, Cambridge. Composers closely concerned with this tradition include Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, Charles Villiers Stanford, and Benjamin Britten. A number of important 20th-century works by non-Anglican composers were originally commissioned for the Anglican choral tradition – for example, the Chichester Psalms of Leonard Bernstein and the Nunc dimittis of Arvo Pärt.
Contrary to popular misconception, the British monarch is not the constitutional "head" but in law the "Supreme Governor" of the Church of England, nor does he or she have any role in provinces outside England. The role of the crown in the Church of England is practically limited to the appointment of bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, and even this role is limited, as the Church presents the government with a short list of candidates from which to choose. This process is accomplished through collaboration with and consent of ecclesial representatives (see Ecclesiastical Commissioners). The monarch has no constitutional role in Anglican churches in other parts of the world, although the prayer books of several countries where she is head of state maintain prayers for her as sovereign.
A characteristic of Anglicanism is that it has no international juridical authority. All 39 provinces of the Anglican Communion are autonomous, each with their own primate and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, Uganda or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the West Indies, Central Africa or South Asia), or geographical regions (such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands) etc. Within these provinces there may exist subdivisions, called ecclesiastical provinces, under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan archbishop.
All provinces of the Anglican Communion consist of dioceses, each under the jurisdiction of a bishop. In the Anglican tradition, bishops must be consecrated according to the strictures of apostolic succession, which Anglicans consider one of the marks of Catholicity. Apart from bishops, there are two other orders of ordained ministry: deacon and priest.
No requirement is made for clerical celibacy, though many Anglo-Catholic priests have traditionally been bachelors. Because of innovations that occurred at various points after the latter half of the 20th century, women may be ordained as deacons in almost all provinces, as priests in most and as bishops in many. Anglican religious orders and communities, suppressed in England during the Reformation, have re-emerged, especially since the mid-19th century, and now have an international presence and influence.
Government in the Anglican Communion is synodical, consisting of three houses of laity (usually elected parish representatives), clergy and bishops. National, provincial and diocesan synods maintain different scopes of authority, depending on their canons and constitutions. Anglicanism is not congregational in its polity: it is the diocese, not the parish church, which is the smallest unit of authority in the church. (See Episcopal polity).
The Archbishop of Canterbury has a precedence of honour over the other primates of the Anglican Communion, and for a province to be considered a part of the communion means specifically to be in full communion with the see of Canterbury – though this principle is currently subject to considerable debate, especially among those in the so-called Global South, including American Anglicans.&#91;84&#93; The archbishop is, therefore, recognised as primus inter pares ("first amongst equals"), even though he does not exercise any direct authority in any province outside England, of which he is chief primate. Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, was the first archbishop appointed from outside the Church of England since the Reformation: he was formerly the Archbishop of Wales.
As "spiritual head" of the Communion, the Archbishop of Canterbury maintains a certain moral authority, and has the right to determine which churches will be in communion with his see. He hosts and chairs the Lambeth Conferences of Anglican Communion bishops, and decides who will be invited to them. He also hosts and chairs the Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting and is responsible for the invitations to it. He acts as president of the secretariat of the Anglican Communion Office and its deliberative body, the Anglican Consultative Council.
The Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. All international bodies are consultative and collaborative, and their resolutions are not legally binding on the autonomous provinces of the Communion. There are three international bodies of note.
Like the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox churches, the Anglican Communion maintains the threefold ministry of deacons, presbyters (usually called "priests"), and bishops.
Bishops, who possess the fullness of Christian priesthood, are the successors of the Apostles. Primates, archbishops, and metropolitans are all bishops and members of the historical episcopate who derive their authority through apostolic succession – an unbroken line of bishops that can be traced back to the 12 apostles of Jesus.
Bishops are assisted by priests and deacons. Most ordained ministers in the Anglican Communion are priests, who usually work in parishes within a diocese. Priests are in charge of the spiritual life of parishes and are usually called the rector or vicar. A curate (or, more correctly, an "assistant curate") is a priest or deacon who assists the parish priest. Non-parochial priests may earn their living by any vocation, although employment by educational institutions or charitable organisations is most common. Priests also serve as chaplains of hospitals, schools, prisons, and in the armed forces.
An archdeacon is a priest or deacon responsible for administration of an archdeaconry, which is often the name given to the principal subdivisions of a diocese. An archdeacon represents the diocesan bishop in his or her archdeaconry. In the Church of England, the position of archdeacon can only be held by someone in priestly orders who has been ordained for at least six years. In some other parts of the Anglican Communion, the position can also be held by deacons. In parts of the Anglican Communion where women cannot be ordained as priests or bishops but can be ordained as deacons, the position of archdeacon is effectively the most senior office to which an ordained woman can be appointed.
A dean is a priest who is the principal cleric of a cathedral or other collegiate church and the head of the chapter of canons. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also rector of the parish. However, in the Church of Ireland, the roles are often separated, and most cathedrals in the Church of England do not have associated parishes. In the Church in Wales, however, most cathedrals are parish churches and their deans are now also vicars of their parishes.
The Anglican Communion recognises Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox ordinations as valid. Outside the Anglican Communion, Anglican ordinations (at least of male priests) are recognised by the Old Catholic Church, Porvoo Communion Lutherans, and various Independent Catholic churches.
In Anglican churches, deacons often work directly in ministry to the marginalised inside and outside the church: the poor, the sick, the hungry, the imprisoned. Unlike Orthodox and most Roman Catholic deacons who may be married only before ordination, deacons are permitted to marry freely both before and after ordination, as are priests. Most deacons are preparing for priesthood and usually only remain as deacons for about a year before being ordained priests. However, there are some deacons who remain so.
Many provinces of the Anglican Communion ordain both men and women as deacons. Many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate. The effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time, as most men proceeded to be ordained priest after a short time as a deacon.
Deacons, in some dioceses, can be granted licences to solemnise matrimony, usually under the instruction of their parish priest and bishop. They sometimes officiate at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in churches which have this service. Deacons are not permitted to preside at the Eucharist (but can lead worship with the distribution of already consecrated communion where this is permitted),&#91;86&#93; absolve sins, or pronounce a blessing.&#91;87&#93; It is the prohibition against deacons pronouncing blessings that leads some to believe that deacons cannot solemnise matrimony.
All baptised members of the church are called Christian faithful, truly equal in dignity and in the work to build the church. Some non-ordained people also have a formal public ministry, often on a full-time and long-term basis – such as lay readers (also known as readers), churchwardens, vergers, and sextons. Other lay positions include acolytes (male or female, often children), lay eucharistic ministers (also known as chalice bearers), and lay eucharistic visitors (who deliver consecrated bread and wine to "shut-ins" or members of the parish who are unable to leave home or hospital to attend the Eucharist). Lay people also serve on the parish altar guild (preparing the altar and caring for its candles, linens, flowers, etc.), in the choir and as cantors, as ushers and greeters, and on the church council (called the "vestry" in some countries), which is the governing body of a parish.
A small yet influential aspect of Anglicanism is its religious orders and communities. Shortly after the beginning of the Catholic Revival in the Church of England, there was a renewal of interest in re-establishing religious and monastic orders and communities. One of Henry VIII's earliest acts was their dissolution and seizure of their assets. In 1841, Marian Rebecca Hughes became the first woman to take the vows of religion in communion with the Province of Canterbury since the Reformation. In 1848, Priscilla Lydia Sellon became the superior of the Society of the Most Holy Trinity at Devonport, Plymouth, the first organised religious order. Sellon is called "the restorer, after three centuries, of the religious life in the Church of England".&#91;88&#93; For the next one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated throughout the world, becoming a numerically small but disproportionately influential feature of global Anglicanism.
Anglican religious life at one time boasted hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of religious. An important aspect of Anglican religious life is that most communities of both men and women lived their lives consecrated to God under the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience (or, in Benedictine communities, Stability, Conversion of Life, and Obedience) by practising a mixed life of reciting the full eight services of the Breviary in choir, along with a daily Eucharist, plus service to the poor. The mixed life, combining aspects of the contemplative orders and the active orders, remains to this day a hallmark of Anglican religious life. Another distinctive feature of Anglican religious life is the existence of some mixed-gender communities.
Since the 1960s, there has been a sharp decline in the number of professed religious in most parts of the Anglican Communion, especially in North America, Europe, and Australia. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery with memberships of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are, however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in approximately 200 communities around the world, and religious life in many parts of the Communion – especially in developing nations – flourishes.
The most significant growth has been in the Melanesian countries of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea. The Melanesian Brotherhood, founded at Tabalia, Guadalcanal, in 1925 by Ini Kopuria, is now the largest Anglican Community in the world, with over 450 brothers in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. The Sisters of the Church, started by Mother Emily Ayckbowm in England in 1870, has more sisters in the Solomons than all their other communities. The Community of the Sisters of Melanesia, started in 1980 by Sister Nesta Tiboe, is a growing community of women throughout the Solomon Islands.
The Society of Saint Francis, founded as a union of various Franciscan orders in the 1920s, has experienced great growth in the Solomon Islands. Other communities of religious have been started by Anglicans in Papua New Guinea and in Vanuatu. Most Melanesian Anglican religious are in their early to mid-20s – vows may be temporary and it is generally assumed that brothers, at least, will leave and marry in due course – making the average age 40 to 50 years younger than their brothers and sisters in other countries. Growth of religious orders, especially for women, is marked in certain parts of Africa.
Anglicanism represents the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.&#91;3&#93; The number of Anglicans in the world is over 85 ;million as of 2011&#91;update&#93;.&#91;89&#93; The 11 provinces in Africa saw growth in the last two decades. They now include 36.7 ;million members, more Anglicans than there are in England. England remains the largest single Anglican province, with 26 ;million members. In most industrialised countries, church attendance has decreased since the 19th century. Anglicanism's presence in the rest of the world is due to large-scale emigration, the establishment of expatriate communities, or the work of missionaries.
The Church of England has been a church of missionaries since the 17th century, when the Church first left English shores with colonists who founded what would become the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and established Anglican churches. For example, an Anglican chaplain, Robert Wolfall, with Martin Frobisher's Arctic expedition, celebrated the Eucharist in 1578 in Frobisher Bay.
The first Anglican church in the Americas was built at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. By the 18th century, missionaries worked to establish Anglican churches in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The great Church of England missionary societies were founded; for example, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) in 1698, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) in 1701, and the Church Mission Society (CMS) in 1799.
The 19th century saw the founding and expansion of social-oriented evangelism with societies such as the Church Pastoral Aid Society (CPAS) in 1836, Mission to Seafarers in 1856, Girls' Friendly Society (GFS) in 1875, Mothers' Union in 1876, and Church Army in 1882, all carrying out a personal form of evangelism.
The 20th century saw the Church of England developing new forms of evangelism such as the Alpha course in 1990, which was developed and propagated from Holy Trinity Brompton Church in London. In the 21st century, there has been renewed effort to reach children and youth. Fresh expressions is a Church of England missionary initiative to youth begun in 2005, and has ministries at a skate park&#91;90&#93; through the efforts of St George's Church, Benfleet, Essex – Diocese of Chelmsford – or youth groups with evocative names, like the C.L.A.W (Christ Little Angels – Whatever!) youth group at Coventry Cathedral. And for the unchurched who do not actually wish to visit a brick and mortar church, there are Internet ministries such as the Diocese of Oxford's online Anglican i-Church, which appeared on the web in 2005.
Anglican interest in ecumenical dialogue can be traced back to the time of the Reformation and dialogues with both Orthodox and Lutheran churches in the 16th century. In the 19th century, with the rise of the Oxford Movement, there arose greater concern for reunion of the churches of "Catholic confession". This desire to work towards full communion with other denominations led to the development of the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral, approved by the third Lambeth Conference of 1888. The four points (the sufficiency of scripture, the historic creeds, the two dominical sacraments, and the historic episcopate) were proposed as a basis for discussion, although they have frequently been taken as a non-negotiable bottom-line for any form of reunion.
Anglicanism in general has always sought a balance between the emphases of Catholicism and Protestantism, while tolerating a range of expressions of evangelicalism and ceremony. Clergy and laity from all Anglican churchmanship traditions have been active in the formation of the Continuing movement.
While there are high-church, broad-church and low-church Continuing Anglicans, many Continuing churches are Anglo-Catholic with highly ceremonial liturgical practices. Others belong to a more evangelical or low-church tradition and tend to support the Thirty-nine Articles and simpler worship services. Morning Prayer, for instance, is often used instead of the Holy Eucharist for Sunday worship services, although this is not necessarily true of all low-church parishes.
Most Continuing churches in the United States reject the 1979 revision of the Book of Common Prayer by the Episcopal Church and use the 1928 version for their services instead. In addition, Anglo-Catholic bodies may use the Anglican Missal, Anglican Service Book or English Missal when celebrating Mass.
A changing focus on social issues after the Second World War led to Lambeth Conference resolutions countenancing contraception and the remarriage of divorced persons. Eventually, most provinces approved the ordination of women. In more recent years, some jurisdictions have permitted the ordination of people in same-sex relationships and authorised rites for the blessing of same-sex unions (see Homosexuality and Anglicanism). "The more liberal provinces that are open to changing Church doctrine on marriage in order to allow for same-sex unions include Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, South India, South Africa, the US and Wales."&#91;91&#93;
The lack of social consensus among and within provinces of diverse cultural traditions has resulted in considerable conflict and even schism concerning some or all of these developments (see Anglican realignment). More conservative elements within and outside of Anglicanism (primarily African churches and factions within North American Anglicanism) have opposed these changes,&#91;92&#93; while some liberal and moderate Anglicans see this opposition as representing a new fundamentalism within Anglicanism and "believe a split is inevitable and preferable to continued infighting and paralysis."&#91;93&#93; Some Anglicans opposed to various liberalising changes, in particular the ordination of women, have become Roman Catholics or Orthodox. Others have, at various times, joined the Continuing Anglican movement.
The term "Continuing Anglicanism" refers to a number of church bodies which have formed outside of the Anglican Communion in the belief that traditional forms of Anglican faith, worship, and order have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades. They therefore claim that they are "continuing" traditional Anglicanism.
The modern Continuing Anglican movement principally dates to the Congress of St. Louis, held in the United States in 1977, where participants rejected changes that had been made in the Episcopal Church's Book of Common Prayer and also the Episcopal Church's approval of the ordination of women to the priesthood. More recent changes in the North American churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the introduction of same-sex marriage rites and the ordination of gay and lesbian people to the priesthood and episcopate, have created further separations.
Continuing churches have generally been formed by people who have left the Anglican Communion. The original Anglican churches are charged by the Continuing Anglicans with being greatly compromised by secular cultural standards and liberal theology. Many Continuing Anglicans believe that the faith of some churches in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury has become unorthodox and therefore have not sought to also be in communion with him.
The original continuing parishes in the United States were found mainly in metropolitan areas. Since the late 1990s, a number have appeared in smaller communities, often as a result of a division in the town's existing Episcopal churches. The 2007–08 Directory of Traditional Anglican and Episcopal Parishes, published by the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen, contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the Continuing Anglican churches or the Anglican realignment movement, a more recent wave of Anglicans withdrawing from the Anglican Communion's North American provinces.
A concern for social justice can be traced to very early Anglican beliefs, relating to an intertwined theology of God, nature, and humanity. The Anglican theologian Richard Hooker wrote in his book The Works of that Learned and Judicious Divine that "God hath created nothing simply for itself, but each thing in all things, and of every thing each part in other have such interest, that in the whole world nothing is found whereunto any thing created can say, 'I need thee not.'"&#91;94&#93; Such statements demonstrate a theological Anglican interest in social activism, which has historically appeared in movements such as evangelical Anglican William Wilberforce's campaign against slavery in the 18th century, or 19th century issues concerning industrialisation.&#91;95&#93;
Lord Shaftesbury, a devout evangelical, campaigned to improve the conditions in factories, in mines, for chimney sweeps, and for the education of the very poor. For years, he was chairman of the Ragged School Board.&#91;96&#93; Frederick Denison Maurice was a leading figure advocating reform, founding so-called "producer's co-operatives" and the Working Men's College. His work was instrumental in the establishment of the Christian socialist movement, although he himself was not in any real sense a socialist but "a Tory paternalist with the unusual desire to theories his acceptance of the traditional obligation to help the poor",&#91;97&#93; influenced Anglo-Catholics such as Charles Gore, who wrote that "the principle of the incarnation is denied unless the Christian spirit can be allowed to concern itself with everything that interests and touches human life. Anglican focus on labour issues culminated in the work of William Temple in the 1930s and 1940s."&#91;95&#93;
A question of whether or not Christianity is a pacifist religion has remained a matter of debate for Anglicans. The leading Anglican spokesman for pacifist ideas, from 1914 to 1945, was Ernest Barnes, bishop of Birmingham from 1924–1953. He opposed both world wars.&#91;98&#93; In 1937, the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship emerged as a distinct reform organisation, seeking to make pacifism a clearly defined part of Anglican theology. The group rapidly gained popularity amongst Anglican intellectuals, including Vera Brittain, Evelyn Underhill, and the former British political leader George Lansbury. Furthermore, Dick Sheppard, who during the 1930s was one of Britain's most famous Anglican priests due to his landmark sermon broadcasts for BBC Radio, founded the Peace Pledge Union, a secular pacifist organisation for the non-religious that gained considerable support throughout the 1930s.&#91;99&#93;
Whilst never actively endorsed by Anglican churches, many Anglicans unofficially have adopted the Augustinian "Just War" doctrine.&#91;100&#93;&#91;101&#93; The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship remains highly active throughout the Anglican world. It rejects this doctrine of "just war" and seeks to reform the Church by reintroducing the pacifism inherent in the beliefs of many of the earliest Christians and present in their interpretation of Christ's Sermon on the Mount. The principles of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship are often formulated as a statement of belief that "Jesus' teaching is incompatible with the waging of war ... that a Christian church should never support or justify war ... [and] that our Christian witness should include opposing the waging or justifying of war."&#91;102&#93;
Confusing the matter was the fact that the 37th Article of Religion in the Book of Common Prayer states that "it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars." Therefore, the Lambeth Council in the modern era has sought to provide a clearer position by repudiating modern war and developed a statement that has been affirmed at each subsequent meeting of the council.
This statement was strongly reasserted when "the 67th General Convention of the Episcopal Church reaffirms the statement made by the Anglican Bishops assembled at Lambeth in 1978 and adopted by the 66th General Convention of the Episcopal Church in 1979, calling "Christian people everywhere ... to engage themselves in non-violent action for justice and peace and to support others so engaged, recognising that such action will be controversial and may be personally very costly... this General Convention, in obedience to this call, urges all members of this Church to support by prayer and by such other means as they deem appropriate, those who engaged in such non-violent action, and particularly those who suffer for conscience' sake as a result; and be it further Resolved, that this General Convention calls upon all members of this Church seriously to consider the implications for their own lives of this call to resist war and work for peace for their own lives."
The focus on other social issues became increasingly diffuse after the Second World War. On the one hand, the growing independence and strength of Anglican churches in the Global South brought new emphasis to issues of global poverty, the inequitable distribution of resources, and the lingering effects of colonialism. In this regard, figures such as Desmond Tutu and Ted Scott were instrumental in mobilising Anglicans worldwide against the apartheid policies of South Africa. Rapid social change in the industrialised world during the 20th century compelled the church to examine issues of gender, sexuality, and marriage.
On 4 November 2009, Pope Benedict XVI issued an apostolic constitution, Anglicanorum Coetibus, to allow groups of former Anglicans to enter into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church as members of personal ordinariates.&#91;103&#93; 20 October 2009 announcement of the imminent constitution mentioned:
Today's announcement of the Apostolic Constitution is a response by Pope Benedict XVI to a number of requests over the past few years to the Holy See from groups of Anglicans who wish to enter into full visible communion with the Roman Catholic Church, and are willing to declare that they share a common Catholic faith and accept the Petrine ministry as willed by Christ for his Church.
Pope Benedict XVI has approved, within the Apostolic Constitution, a canonical structure that provides for Personal Ordinariates, which will allow former Anglicans to enter full communion with the Catholic Church while preserving elements of distinctive Anglican spiritual patrimony.
For each personal ordinariate, the ordinary may be a former Anglican bishop or priest. It was expected that provision would be made to allow the retention of aspects of Anglican liturgy; cf. Anglican Use.&#91;105&#93;

Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism that identifies with the teachings of Martin Luther, a 16th-century German reformer. Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation. The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings, beginning with the 95 Theses, divided Western Christianity.&#91;1&#93;
The split between the Lutherans and the Catholics was made public and clear with the 1521 Edict of Worms: the edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas, subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property, half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation.&#91;2&#93;
The divide centered primarily on two points: the proper source of authority in the church, often called the formal principle of the Reformation, and the doctrine of justification, often called the material principle of Lutheran theology.&#91;a&#93; Lutheranism advocates a doctrine of justification "by grace alone through faith alone on the basis of Scripture alone", the doctrine that scripture is the final authority on all matters of faith. This is in contrast to the belief of the Roman Catholic Church, defined at the Council of Trent, concerning authority coming from both the Scriptures and Tradition.&#91;3&#93;
Unlike Calvinism, Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church, with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper. Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology, divine grace, the purpose of God's Law, the concept of perseverance of the saints, and predestination.
The name Lutheran originated as a derogatory term used against Luther by German Scholastic theologian Dr. Johann Maier von Eck during the Leipzig Debate in July 1519.&#91;4&#93; Eck and other Roman Catholics followed the traditional practice of naming a heresy after its leader, thus labeling all who identified with the theology of Martin Luther as Lutherans.&#91;2&#93;
Martin Luther always disliked the term Lutheran, preferring the term Evangelical, which was derived from εὐαγγέλιον euangelion, a Greek word meaning "good news", i.e. "Gospel".&#91;4&#93; The followers of John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli, and other theologians linked to the Reformed tradition also used that term. To distinguish the two evangelical groups, others began to refer to the two groups as Evangelical Lutheran and Evangelical Reformed. As time passed by, the word Evangelical was dropped. Lutherans themselves began to use the term Lutheran in the middle of the 16th century, in order to distinguish themselves from other groups such as the Anabaptists and Calvinists.
In 1597, theologians in Wittenberg defined the title Lutheran as referring to the true church.&#91;2&#93;
Lutheranism has its roots in the work of Martin Luther, who sought to reform the Western Church to what he considered a more biblical foundation.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;
Lutheranism spread through all of Scandinavia during the 16th century, as the monarch of Denmark–Norway (also ruling Iceland and the Faroe Islands) and the monarch of Sweden (also ruling Finland) adopted Lutheranism. Through Baltic-German and Swedish rule, Lutheranism also spread into Estonia and Latvia.
Since 1520, regular&#91;7&#93; Lutheran services have been held in Copenhagen. Under the reign of Frederick I (1523–33), Denmark–Norway remained officially Catholic. Although Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans, he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers, the most significant being Hans Tausen.&#91;8&#93;
During Frederick's reign, Lutheranism made significant inroads in Denmark. At an open meeting in Copenhagen attended by King Christian III in 1536, the people shouted; "We will stand by the holy Gospel, and do not want such bishops anymore".&#91;9&#93; Frederick's son, the later Christian III, was openly Lutheran, which prevented his election to the throne upon his father's death in 1533. However, following his victory in the civil war that followed, in 1536 he became Christian III and advanced the Reformation in Denmark–Norway.
The constitution upon which the Danish Norwegian Church, according to the Church Ordinance, should rest was "The pure word of God, which is the Law and the Gospel".&#91;10&#93; It does not mention the&#91;7&#93; Augsburg Confession. The priests had to&#91;7&#93; understand the Holy Scripture well enough to preach and explain the Gospel and the Epistles for their congregations.
The youths were taught&#91;11&#93; from Luther's Small Catechism, available in Danish since 1532. They were taught to expect at the end of life:&#91;7&#93; "forgiving of their sins", "to be counted as just", and "the eternal life". Instruction is still similar.&#91;12&#93;
The first complete Bible in Danish was based on Martin Luther's translation into German. It was published in 1550, with 3,000 copies printed in the first edition; a second edition was published in 1589.&#91;13&#93; Unlike Catholicism, the Lutheran Church does not believe that tradition is a carrier of the "Word of God", or that only the communion of the Bishop of Rome has been entrusted to interpret the "Word of God".&#91;7&#93;&#91;14&#93;
The Reformation in Sweden began with Olaus and Laurentius Petri, brothers who took the Reformation to Sweden after studying in Germany. They led Gustav Vasa, elected king in 1523, to Lutheranism. The pope's refusal to allow the replacement of an archbishop who had supported the invading forces opposing Gustav Vasa during the Stockholm Bloodbath led to the severing of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy in 1523.&#91;8&#93;
Four years later, at the Diet of Västerås ;&#91;sv&#93;, the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church. The king was given possession of all church properties, as well as the church appointments and approval of the clergy. While this effectively granted official sanction to Lutheran ideas,&#91;8&#93; Lutheranism did not become official until 1593. At that time the Uppsala Synod declared Holy Scripture the sole guideline for faith, with four documents accepted as faithful and authoritative explanations of it: the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, and the unaltered Augsburg Confession of 1530.&#91;15&#93; Mikael Agricola's translation of the first Finnish New Testament was published in 1548.&#91;16&#93;
After the death of Martin Luther in 1546, the Schmalkaldic War started out as a conflict between two German Lutheran rulers in 1547. Soon, Holy Roman Imperial forces joined the battle and conquered the members of the Schmalkaldic League, oppressing and exiling many German Lutherans as they enforced the terms of the Augsburg Interim. Religious freedom in some areas was secured for Lutherans through the Peace of Passau in 1552, and under the legal principle of Cuius regio, eius religio (the religion of the ruler was to dictate the religion of those ruled) and the Declaratio Ferdinandei (limited religious tolerance) clauses of the Peace of Augsburg in 1555.&#91;17&#93;
Religious disputes between the Crypto-Calvinists, Philippists, Sacramentarians, Ubiquitarians and Gnesio-Lutherans raged within Lutheranism during the middle of the 16th century. This finally ended with the resolution of the issues in the Formula of Concord. Large numbers of politically and religiously influential leaders met together, debated, and resolved these topics on the basis of Scripture, resulting in the Formula, which over 8,000 leaders signed. The Book of Concord replaced earlier, incomplete collections of doctrine, unifying all German Lutherans with identical doctrine and beginning the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy.
In lands where Catholicism was the state religion, Lutheranism was officially illegal, although enforcement varied. Until the end of the Counter-Reformation, some Lutherans worshipped secretly, such as at the Hundskirke (which translates as dog church or dog altar). It is a triangle-shaped Communion rock in a ditch between crosses in Paternion, Austria. The crowned serpent is possibly an allusion to Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, while the dog possibly refers to Peter Canisius. Another figure interpreted as a snail carrying a church tower is possibly a metaphor for the Protestant church. Also on the rock is the number 1599 and a phrase translating as "thus gets in the world."&#91;18&#93;
The historical period of Lutheran Orthodoxy is divided into three sections: Early Orthodoxy (1580–1600), High Orthodoxy (1600–1685), and Late Orthodoxy (1685–1730). Lutheran scholasticism developed gradually especially for the purpose of arguing with the Jesuits, and it was finally established by Johann Gerhard. Abraham Calovius represents the climax of the scholastic paradigm in orthodox Lutheranism. Other orthodox Lutheran theologians include Martin Chemnitz, Aegidius Hunnius, Leonhard Hutter, Nicolaus Hunnius, Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand, Salomo Glassius, Johann Hülsemann, Johann Conrad Dannhauer, Johannes Andreas Quenstedt, Johann Friedrich König, and Johann Wilhelm Baier.
Near the end of the Thirty Years' War, the compromising spirit seen in Philip Melanchthon rose up again in Helmstedt School and especially in theology of Georgius Calixtus, causing the syncretistic controversy. Another theological issue that arose was the Crypto-Kenotic controversy.&#91;19&#93;
Late orthodoxy was torn by influences from rationalism, philosophy based on reason, and Pietism, a revival movement in Lutheranism. After a century of vitality, the Pietist theologians Philipp Jakob Spener and August Hermann Francke warned that orthodoxy had degenerated into meaningless intellectualism and formalism, while orthodox theologians found the emotional and subjective focuses of Pietism to be vulnerable to Rationalist propaganda.&#91;20&#93; In 1688, the Finnish Radical Pietist Lars Ulstadius ran down the main aisle of Turku Cathedral naked while screaming that the disgrace of Finnish clergymen would be revealed, like his current disgrace.
The last famous orthodox Lutheran theologian before the rationalist Aufklärung, or Enlightenment, was David Hollatz. Late orthodox theologian Valentin Ernst Löscher took part in the controversy against Pietism. Medieval mystical traditions continued in the works of Martin Moller, Johann Arndt, and Joachim Lütkemann. Pietism became a rival of orthodoxy but adopted some devotional literature by orthodox theologians, including Arndt, Christian Scriver and Stephan Prätorius.
Rationalist philosophers from France and England had an enormous impact during the 18th century, along with the German Rationalists Christian Wolff, Gottfried Leibniz, and Immanuel Kant. Their work led to an increase in rationalist beliefs, "at the expense of faith in God and agreement with the Bible".&#91;20&#93;
In 1709, Valentin Ernst Löscher warned that this new Rationalist view of the world fundamentally changed society by drawing into question every aspect of theology. Instead of considering the authority of divine revelation, he explained, Rationalists relied solely on their personal understanding when searching for truth.&#91;21&#93;
Johann Melchior Goeze (1717–1786), pastor of St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg, wrote apologetical works against Rationalists, including a theological and historical defence against the historical criticism of the Bible.&#91;22&#93;
Dissenting Lutheran pastors were often reprimanded by the government bureaucracy overseeing them, for example, when they tried to correct Rationalist influences in the parish school.&#91;23&#93; As a result of the impact of a local form of rationalism, termed Neology, by the latter half of the 18th century, genuine piety was found almost solely in small Pietist conventicles.&#91;20&#93; However, some of the laity preserved Lutheran orthodoxy from both Pietism and rationalism through reusing old catechisms, hymnbooks, postils, and devotional writings, including those written by Johann Gerhard, Heinrich Müller and Christian Scriver.&#91;24&#93;
A layman, Luther scholar Johann Georg Hamann (1730–1788), became famous for countering Rationalism and striving to advance a revival known as the Erweckung, or Awakening.&#91;25&#93; In 1806, Napoleon's invasion of Germany promoted Rationalism and angered German Lutherans, stirring up a desire among the people to preserve Luther's theology from the Rationalist threat. Those associated with this Awakening held that reason was insufficient and pointed out the importance of emotional religious experiences.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;
Small groups sprang up, often in universities, which devoted themselves to Bible study, reading devotional writings, and revival meetings. Although the beginning of this Awakening tended heavily toward Romanticism, patriotism, and experience, the emphasis of the Awakening shifted around 1830 to restoring the traditional liturgy, doctrine, and confessions of the Lutheran church in the Neo-Lutheran movement.&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;
This Awakening swept through all of Scandinavia though not Iceland.&#91;28&#93; It developed from both German Neo-Lutheranism and Pietism. Danish pastor and philosopher N. F. S. Grundtvig reshaped church life throughout Denmark through a reform movement beginning in 1830. He also wrote about 1,500 hymns, including God's Word Is Our Great Heritage.&#91;29&#93;
In Norway, Hans Nielsen Hauge, a lay street preacher, emphasized spiritual discipline and sparked the Haugean movement,&#91;30&#93; which was followed by the Johnsonian Awakening within the state-church.&#91;31&#93; The Awakening drove the growth of foreign missions in Norway to non-Christians to a new height, which has never been reached since.&#91;28&#93; In Sweden, Lars Levi Læstadius began the Laestadian movement that emphasized moral reform.&#91;30&#93; In Finland, a farmer, Paavo Ruotsalainen, began the Finnish Awakening when he took to preaching about repentance and prayer.&#91;30&#93;
In 1817, Frederick William III of Prussia ordered the Lutheran and Reformed churches in his territory to unite, forming the Prussian Union of Churches. The unification of the two branches of German Protestantism sparked the Schism of the Old Lutherans. Many Lutherans, called "Old Lutherans", chose to leave the state churches despite imprisonment and military force.&#91;25&#93; Some formed independent church bodies, or "free churches", at home while others left for the United States, Canada and Australia. A similar legislated merger in Silesia prompted thousands to join the Old Lutheran movement. The dispute over ecumenism overshadowed other controversies within German Lutheranism.&#91;32&#93;
Despite political meddling in church life, local and national leaders sought to restore and renew Christianity. Neo-Lutheran Johann Konrad Wilhelm Löhe and Old Lutheran free church leader Friedrich August Brünn&#91;33&#93; both sent young men overseas to serve as pastors to German Americans, while the Inner Mission focused on renewing the situation home.&#91;34&#93; Johann Gottfried Herder, superintendent at Weimar and part of the Inner Mission movement, joined with the Romantic movement with his quest to preserve human emotion and experience from Rationalism.&#91;35&#93;
Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg, though raised Reformed, became convinced of the truth of historic Lutheranism as a young man.&#91;36&#93; He led the Neo-Lutheran Repristination School of theology, which advocated a return to the orthodox theologians of the 17th century and opposed modern Bible scholarship.&#91;37&#93;&#91;better ;source ;needed&#93; As editor of the periodical Evangelische Kirchenzeitung, he developed it into a major support of Neo-Lutheran revival and used it to attack all forms of theological liberalism and rationalism. Although he received a large amount of slander and ridicule during his forty years at the head of revival, he never gave up his positions.&#91;36&#93;
The theological faculty at the University of Erlangen in Bavaria became another force for reform.&#91;36&#93; There, professor Adolf von Harless, though previously an adherent of rationalism and German idealism, made Erlangen a magnet for revival oriented theologians.&#91;38&#93; Termed the Erlangen School of theology, they developed a new version of the Incarnation,&#91;38&#93; which they felt emphasized the humanity of Jesus better than the ecumenical creeds.&#91;39&#93; As theologians, they used both modern historical critical and Hegelian philosophical methods instead of attempting to revive the orthodoxy of the 17th century.&#91;40&#93;
Friedrich Julius Stahl led the High Church Lutherans. Though raised a Jew, he was baptized as a Christian at the age of 19 through the influence of the Lutheran school he attended. As the leader of a neofeudal Prussian political party, he campaigned for the divine right of kings, the power of the nobility, and episcopal polity for the church. Along with Theodor Kliefoth and August Friedrich Christian Vilmar, he promoted agreement with the Roman Catholic Church with regard to the authority of the institutional church, ex opere operato effectiveness of the sacraments, and the divine authority of clergy. Unlike Catholics, however, they also urged complete agreement with the Book of Concord.&#91;39&#93;
The Neo-Lutheran movement managed to slow secularism and counter atheistic Marxism, but it did not fully succeed in Europe.&#91;34&#93; It partly succeeded in continuing the Pietist movement's drive to right social wrongs and focus on individual conversion. The Neo-Lutheran call to renewal failed to achieve widespread popular acceptance because it both began and continued with a lofty, idealistic Romanticism that did not connect with an increasingly industrialized and secularized Europe.&#91;41&#93; At best, the work of local leaders resulted in specific areas with vibrant spiritual renewal, but people in Lutheran areas overall continued to become increasingly distant from church life.&#91;34&#93; Additionally, the revival movements were divided by philosophical traditions. The Repristination school and Old Lutherans tended towards Kantianism, while the Erlangen school promoted a conservative Hegelian perspective. By 1969, Manfried Kober complained that "unbelief is rampant" even within German Lutheran parishes.&#91;42&#93;
Traditionally, Lutherans hold the Bible of the Old and New Testaments to be the only divinely inspired book, the only source of divinely revealed knowledge, and the only norm for Christian teaching.&#91;43&#93; Scripture alone is the formal principle of the faith, the final authority for all matters of faith and morals because of its inspiration, authority, clarity, efficacy, and sufficiency.&#91;44&#93;
The authority of the Scriptures has been challenged during the history of Lutheranism. Martin Luther taught that the Bible was the written Word of God, and the only reliable guide for faith and practice. He held that every passage of Scripture has one straightforward meaning, the literal sense as interpreted by other Scripture.&#91;45&#93; These teachings were accepted during the orthodox Lutheranism of the 17th century.&#91;46&#93; During the 18th century, Rationalism advocated reason rather than the authority of the Bible as the final source of knowledge, but most of the laity did not accept this Rationalist position.&#91;47&#93; In the 19th century, a confessional revival re-emphasized the authority of the Bible and agreement with the Lutheran Confessions.
Today, Lutherans disagree about the inspiration and authority of the Bible. Theological conservatives use the historical-grammatical method of Biblical interpretation, while theological liberals use the higher critical method. The 2008 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center surveyed 1,926 adults in the United States that self-identified as Lutheran. The study found that 30% believed that the Bible was the Word of God and was to be taken literally word for word. 40% held that the Bible was the Word of God, but was not literally true word for word or were unsure if it was literally true word for word. 23% said the Bible was written by men and not the Word of God. 7% did not know, were not sure, or had other positions.&#91;48&#93;
Although many Lutherans today hold less specific views of inspiration, historically, Lutherans affirm that the Bible does not merely contain the Word of God, but every word of it is, because of plenary, verbal inspiration, the direct, immediate word of God.&#91;49&#93; The Apology of the Augsburg Confession identifies Holy Scripture with the Word of God&#91;50&#93; and calls the Holy Spirit the author of the Bible.&#91;51&#93; Because of this, Lutherans confess in the Formula of Concord, "we receive and embrace with our whole heart the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the pure, clear fountain of Israel."&#91;52&#93; The apocryphal books were not written by the prophets nor by inspiration; they contain errors&#91;53&#93; and were never included in the Judean Canon that Jesus used;&#91;54&#93; therefore they are not a part of Holy Scripture.&#91;55&#93; The prophetic and apostolic Scriptures are authentic as written by the prophets and apostles. A correct translation of their writings is God's Word because it has the same meaning as the original Hebrew and Greek.&#91;55&#93; A mistranslation is not God's word, and no human authority can invest it with divine authority.&#91;55&#93;
Historically, Lutherans understand the Bible to present all doctrines and commands of the Christian faith clearly.&#91;56&#93; In addition, Lutherans believe that God's Word is freely accessible to every reader or hearer of ordinary intelligence, without requiring any special education.&#91;57&#93; A Lutheran must understand the language that scriptures are presented in, and should not be so preoccupied by error so as to prevent understanding.&#91;58&#93; As a result of this, Lutherans do not believe there is a need to wait for any clergy, pope, scholar, or ecumenical council to explain the real meaning of any part of the Bible.&#91;59&#93;
Lutherans confess that Scripture is united with the power of the Holy Spirit and with it, not only demands, but also creates the acceptance of its teaching.&#91;60&#93; This teaching produces faith and obedience. Holy Scripture is not a dead letter, but rather, the power of the Holy Spirit is inherent in it.&#91;61&#93; Scripture does not compel a mere intellectual assent to its doctrine, resting on logical argumentation, but rather it creates the living agreement of faith.&#91;62&#93; As the Smalcald Articles affirm, "in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the preceding outward Word."&#91;63&#93;
Lutherans are confident that the Bible contains everything that one needs to know in order to obtain salvation and to live a Christian life.&#91;64&#93; There are no deficiencies in Scripture that need to be filled with by tradition, pronouncements of the Pope, new revelations, or present-day development of doctrine.&#91;65&#93;
Lutherans understand the Bible as containing two distinct types of content, termed Law and Gospel (or Law and Promises).&#91;66&#93; Properly distinguishing between Law and Gospel prevents the obscuring of the Gospel teaching of justification by grace through faith alone.&#91;67&#93;
The Book of Concord, published in 1580, contains ten documents which some Lutherans believe are faithful and authoritative explanations of Holy Scripture. Besides the three Ecumenical Creeds, which date to Roman times, the Book of Concord contains seven credal documents articulating Lutheran theology in the Reformation era.
The doctrinal positions of Lutheran churches are not uniform because the Book of Concord does not hold the same position in all Lutheran churches. For example, the state churches in Scandinavia consider only the Augsburg Confession as a "summary of the faith" in addition to the three ecumenical Creeds.&#91;68&#93; Lutheran pastors, congregations, and church bodies in Germany and the Americas usually agree to teach in harmony with the entire Lutheran Confessions. Some Lutheran church bodies require this pledge to be unconditional because they believe the confessions correctly state what the Bible teaches. Others allow their congregations to do so "insofar as" the Confessions are in agreement with the Bible.
In addition, Lutherans accept the teachings of the first seven ecumenical councils of the Christian Church.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93; The Augsburg Confession teaches that "the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church".&#91;71&#93; When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, they explained "that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils."&#91;71&#93;
The key doctrine, or material principle, of Lutheranism is the doctrine of justification. Lutherans believe that humans are saved from their sins by God's grace alone (Sola Gratia), through faith alone (Sola Fide), on the basis of Scripture alone (Sola Scriptura). Orthodox Lutheran theology holds that God made the world, including humanity, perfect, holy and sinless. However, Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, trusting in their own strength, knowledge, and wisdom.&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93; Consequently, people are saddled with original sin, born sinful and unable to avoid committing sinful acts.&#91;74&#93; For Lutherans, original sin is the "chief sin, a root and fountainhead of all actual sins."&#91;75&#93;
Lutherans teach that sinners, while capable of doing works that are outwardly "good", are not capable of doing works that satisfy God's justice.&#91;76&#93; Every human thought and deed is infected with sin and sinful motives.&#91;77&#93; Because of this, all humanity deserves eternal damnation in hell.&#91;78&#93; God in eternity has turned His Fatherly heart to this world and planned for its redemption because he loves all people and does not want anyone to be eternally damned.&#91;79&#93;
To this end, "God sent his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord, into the world to redeem and deliver us from the power of the devil, and to bring us to Himself, and to govern us as a King of righteousness, life, and salvation against sin, death, and an evil conscience," as Luther's Large Catechism explains.&#91;80&#93; Because of this, Lutherans teach that salvation is possible only because of the grace of God made manifest in the birth, life, suffering, death, and resurrection, and continuing presence by the power of the Holy Spirit, of Jesus Christ.&#91;81&#93; By God's grace, made known and effective in the person and work of Jesus Christ, a person is forgiven, adopted as a child and heir of God, and given eternal salvation.&#91;82&#93; Christ, because he was entirely obedient to the law with respect to both his human and divine natures, "is a perfect satisfaction and reconciliation of the human race," as the Formula of Concord asserts, and proceeds to summarize:&#91;83&#93;
Lutherans believe that individuals receive this gift of salvation through faith alone.&#91;84&#93; Saving faith is the knowledge of,&#91;85&#93; acceptance of,&#91;86&#93; and trust&#91;87&#93; in the promise of the Gospel.&#91;88&#93; Even faith itself is seen as a gift of God, created in the hearts of Christians&#91;89&#93; by the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word&#91;90&#93; and Baptism.&#91;91&#93; Faith receives the gift of salvation rather than causes salvation.&#91;92&#93; Thus, Lutherans reject the "decision theology" which is common among modern evangelicals.
Since the term grace has been defined differently by other Christian church bodies (e.g. Roman Catholicism&#91;93&#93;) it is important to note that Lutheranism defines grace as entirely limited to God's gifts to us. Justification comes as a pure gift, not something we merit by changed behavior or in which we cooperate. Grace is not about our response to God's gifts, but only His gifts.
Lutherans believe Jesus is the Christ, the savior promised in the Old Testament. They believe he is both by nature God and by nature man in one person, as they confess in Luther's Small Catechism that he is "true God begotten of the Father from eternity and also true man born of the Virgin Mary".&#91;97&#93;
The Augsburg Confession explains:&#91;98&#93;
[T]he Son of God, did assume the human nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin Mary, so that there are two natures, the divine and the human, inseparably enjoined in one Person, one Christ, true God and true man, who was born of the Virgin Mary, truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, that He might reconcile the Father unto us, and be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.
Lutherans hold that sacraments are sacred acts of divine institution.&#91;100&#93; Whenever they are properly administered by the use of the physical component commanded by God&#91;101&#93; along with the divine words of institution,&#91;102&#93; God is, in a way specific to each sacrament, present with the Word and physical component.&#91;103&#93; He earnestly offers to all who receive the sacrament&#91;104&#93; forgiveness of sins&#91;105&#93; and eternal salvation.&#91;106&#93; He also works in the recipients to get them to accept these blessings and to increase the assurance of their possession.&#91;107&#93;
Lutherans are not dogmatic about the number of the sacraments.&#91;108&#93; In line with Luther's initial statement in his Large Catechism some speak of only two sacraments,&#91;109&#93; Baptism and Holy Communion, although later in the same work he calls Confession and Absolution&#91;110&#93; "the third sacrament."&#91;111&#93; The definition of sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession lists Absolution as one of them.&#91;112&#93; With the exception of Laestadian Lutherans, Private Confession is not practiced among Lutherans as often as in the Catholic Church. Rather, it is expected before receiving the Eucharist for the first time.&#91;113&#93;&#91;114&#93; Some churches also allow for individual absolution on Saturdays before the Eucharistic service.&#91;115&#93; A general confession and absolution (known as the Penitential Rite) is proclaimed in the Eucharistic liturgy.
Lutherans hold that Baptism is a saving work of God,&#91;116&#93; mandated and instituted by Jesus Christ.&#91;117&#93; Baptism is a "means of grace" through which God creates and strengthens "saving faith" as the "washing of regeneration"&#91;118&#93; in which infants and adults are reborn.&#91;119&#93; Since the creation of faith is exclusively God's work, it does not depend on the actions of the one baptized, whether infant or adult. Even though baptized infants cannot articulate that faith, Lutherans believe that it is present all the same.&#91;120&#93;
It is faith alone that receives these divine gifts, so Lutherans confess that baptism "works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare."&#91;121&#93; Lutherans hold fast to the Scripture cited in 1 Peter 3:21, "Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."&#91;122&#93; Therefore, Lutherans administer Baptism to both infants&#91;123&#93; and adults.&#91;124&#93; In the special section on infant baptism in his Large Catechism, Luther argues that infant baptism is God-pleasing because persons so baptized were reborn and sanctified by the Holy Spirit.&#91;125&#93;&#91;126&#93;
Lutherans hold that within the Eucharist, also referred to as the Sacrament of the Altar, the Mass, or the Lord's Supper, the true body and blood of Christ are truly present "in, with, and under the forms" of the consecrated bread and wine for all those who eat and drink it,&#91;127&#93; a doctrine that the Formula of Concord calls the sacramental union.&#91;128&#93;
Many Lutherans receive the sacrament of penance before receiving the Eucharist.&#91;129&#93;&#91;115&#93; Prior to going to Confessing and receiving Absolution, the faithful are expected to examine their lives in light of the Ten Commandments.&#91;114&#93; An order of Confession and Absolution is contained in the Small Catechism, as well as in liturgical books.&#91;114&#93; Lutherans typically kneel at the communion rails to confess their sins, while the confessor listens and then offers absolution while laying their stole on the penitent's head.&#91;114&#93; Clergy are prohibited from revealing anything said during private Confession and Absolution per the Seal of the Confessional, and face excommunication if it is violated. Apart from this, Laestadian Lutherans have a practice of lay confession.&#91;130&#93;
In Lutheranism, conversion or regeneration in the strict sense of the term is the work of divine grace and power by which man, born of the flesh, and void of all power to think, to will, or to do any good thing, and dead in sin is, through the gospel and holy baptism, taken from a state of sin and spiritual death under God's wrath into a state of spiritual life of faith and grace, rendered able to will and to do what is spiritually good and, especially, made to trust in the benefits of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.&#91;131&#93;
During conversion, one is moved from impenitence to repentance. The Augsburg Confession divides repentance into two parts: "One is contrition, that is, terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of the Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ's sake, sins are forgiven, comforts the conscience, and delivers it from terrors."&#91;132&#93;
Lutherans adhere to divine monergism, the teaching that salvation is by God's act alone, and therefore reject the idea that humans in their fallen state have a free will concerning spiritual matters.&#91;133&#93; Lutherans believe that although humans have free will concerning civil righteousness, they cannot work spiritual righteousness in the heart without the presence and aid of the Holy Spirit.&#91;134&#93;&#91;135&#93; Lutherans believe Christians are "saved";&#91;136&#93; that all who trust in Christ alone and his promises can be certain of their salvation.&#91;137&#93;
According to Lutheranism, the central final hope of the Christian is "the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting" as confessed in the Apostles' Creed rather than predestination. Lutherans disagree with those who make predestination—rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection—the source of salvation. Unlike some Calvinists, Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation,&#91;138&#93; usually referencing "God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth"&#91;139&#93; as contrary evidence to such a claim. Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&#91;140&#93;
According to Lutherans, God preserves his creation, cooperates with everything that happens, and guides the universe.&#91;141&#93; While God cooperates with both good and evil deeds, with evil deeds he does so only inasmuch as they are deeds, but not with the evil in them. God concurs with an act's effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect.&#91;142&#93; Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.&#91;143&#93;
The explanation of the Apostles' Creed given in the Small Catechism declares that everything good that people have is given and preserved by God, either directly or through other people or things.&#91;144&#93; Of the services others provide us through family, government, and work, "we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God."&#91;145&#93; Since God uses everyone's useful tasks for good, people should not look down upon some useful vocations as being less worthy than others. Instead people should honor others, no matter how lowly, as being the means God uses to work in the world.&#91;145&#93;
Lutherans believe that good works are the fruit of faith,&#91;146&#93; always and in every instance.&#91;147&#93; Good works have their origin in God,&#91;148&#93; not in the fallen human heart or in human striving;&#91;149&#93; their absence would demonstrate that faith, too, is absent.&#91;150&#93; Lutherans do not believe that good works are a factor in obtaining salvation; they believe that we are saved by the grace of God—based on the merit of Christ in his suffering and death—and faith in the Triune God. Good works are the natural result of faith, not the cause of salvation. Although Christians are no longer compelled to keep God's law, they freely and willingly serve God and their neighbors.&#91;151&#93;
Lutherans do not believe in any sort of earthly millennial kingdom of Christ either before or after his second coming on the last day.&#91;153&#93; Lutherans teach that, at death, the souls of Christians are immediately taken into the presence of Jesus,&#91;154&#93; where they await the second coming of Jesus on the last day.&#91;155&#93; On the last day,&#91;156&#93; all the bodies of the dead will be resurrected.&#91;157&#93;
Their souls will then be reunited with the same bodies they had before dying.&#91;158&#93; The bodies will then be changed, those of the wicked to a state of everlasting shame and torment,&#91;159&#93; those of the righteous to an everlasting state of celestial glory.&#91;160&#93; After the resurrection of all the dead,&#91;161&#93; and the change of those still living,&#91;162&#93; all nations shall be gathered before Christ,&#91;163&#93; and he will separate the righteous from the wicked.&#91;164&#93;
Christ will publicly judge&#91;165&#93; all people by the testimony of their deeds,&#91;166&#93; the good works&#91;167&#93; of the righteous in evidence of their faith,&#91;168&#93; and the evil works of the wicked in evidence of their unbelief.&#91;169&#93; He will judge in righteousness&#91;170&#93; in the presence of all people and angels,&#91;171&#93; and his final judgment will be just damnation to everlasting punishment for the wicked and a gracious gift of life everlasting to the righteous.&#91;172&#93;

Lutherans place great emphasis on a liturgical approach to worship services;&#91;202&#93; although there are substantial non-liturgical minorities, for example, the Haugean Lutherans from Norway. Martin Luther was a great fan of music, and this is why it forms a large part of Lutheran services; in particular, Luther admired the composers Josquin des Prez and Ludwig Senfl and wanted singing in the church to move away from the ars perfecta (Catholic Sacred Music of the late Renaissance) and towards singing as a Gemeinschaft (community).&#91;203&#93; Lutheran hymns are sometimes known as chorales. Lutheran hymnody is well known for its doctrinal, didactic, and musical richness. Most Lutheran churches are active musically with choirs, handbell choirs, children's choirs, and occasionally change ringing groups that ring bells in a bell tower. Johann Sebastian Bach, a devout Lutheran, composed music for the Lutheran church.
Lutherans also preserve a liturgical approach to the celebration of the Mass (or the Holy Eucharist/Communion), emphasizing the sacrament as the central act of Christian worship. Lutherans believe that the actual body and blood of Jesus Christ are present in, with and under the bread and the wine. This belief is called Real Presence or sacramental union and is different from consubstantiation and transubstantiation. Additionally Lutherans reject the idea that communion is a mere symbol or memorial. They confess in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession:
The predominant rite used by the Lutheran Churches is a Western one based on the Formula missae ("Form of the Mass") although other Lutheran liturgies are also in use, such as those used in the Byzantine Rite Lutheran Churches, such as the Ukrainian Lutheran Church and Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovenia.&#91;206&#93; Although Luther's Deutsche Messe was completely chanted except for the sermon, this is usually not the case today.
In the 1970s, many Lutheran churches began holding contemporary worship services for the purpose of evangelistic outreach. These services were in a variety of styles, depending on the preferences of the congregation. Often they were held alongside a traditional service in order to cater to those who preferred contemporary worship music. Today, few but some Lutheran congregations have contemporary worship as their sole form of worship. Outreach is no longer given as the primary motivation; rather this form of worship is seen as more in keeping with the desires of individual congregations.&#91;207&#93; In Finland, Lutherans have experimented with the St Thomas Mass ;&#91;fi&#93; and Metal Mass in which traditional hymns are adapted to heavy metal. Some Laestadians enter a heavily emotional and ecstatic state during worship. The Lutheran World Federation, in its Nairobi Statement on Worship and Culture, recommended every effort be made to bring church services into a more sensitive position with regard to cultural context.&#91;208&#93;
In 2006, both the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS), in cooperation with certain foreign English speaking church bodies within their respective fellowships, released new hymnals: Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELCA) and Lutheran Service Book (LCMS). Along with these, the most widely used among English speaking congregations include: Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary (1996, Evangelical Lutheran Synod), The Lutheran Book of Worship (1978, Lutheran Council in the United States of America), Lutheran Worship (1982, LCMS), Christian Worship (1993, Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod), and The Lutheran Hymnal (1941, Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America). In the Lutheran Church of Australia, the official hymnal is the Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement of 1986, which includes a supplement to the Lutheran Hymnal of 1973, itself a replacement for the Australian Lutheran Hymn Book of 1921. Prior to this time, the two Lutheran church bodies in Australia (which merged in 1966) used a bewildering variety of hymnals, usually in the German language. Spanish-speaking ELCA churches frequently use Libro de Liturgia y Cántico (1998, Augsburg Fortress) for services and hymns. For a more complete list, see List of English language Lutheran hymnals.
Sizable Lutheran missions arose for the first time during the 19th century. Early missionary attempts during the century after the Reformation did not succeed. However, European traders brought Lutheranism to Africa beginning in the 17th century as they settled along the coasts. During the first half of the 19th century, missionary activity in Africa expanded, including preaching by missionaries, translation of the Bible, and education.&#91;209&#93;
Lutheranism came to India beginning with the work of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg, where a community totaling several thousand developed, complete with their own translation of the Bible, catechism, their own hymnal, and system of Lutheran schools. In the 1840s, this church experienced a revival through the work of the Leipzig Mission, including Karl Graul.&#91;210&#93; After German missionaries were expelled in 1914, Lutherans in India became entirely autonomous, yet preserved their Lutheran character. In recent years India has relaxed its anti-religious conversion laws, allowing a resurgence in missionary work.
In Latin America, missions began to serve European immigrants of Lutheran background, both those who spoke German and those who no longer did. These churches in turn began to evangelize those in their areas who were not of European background, including indigenous peoples.&#91;211&#93;
In 1892, the first Lutheran missionaries reached Japan. Although work began slowly and a major setback occurred during the hardships of WWII.&#91;212&#93; Lutheranism there has survived and become self-sustaining.&#91;213&#93; After missionaries to China, including those of the Lutheran Church of China, were expelled, they began ministry in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter which became a center of Lutheranism in Asia.&#91;213&#93;
The Lutheran Mission in New Guinea, though founded only in 1953, became the largest Lutheran mission in the world in only several decades. Through the work of native lay evangelists, many tribes of diverse languages were reached with the Gospel.&#91;213&#93;
Today the Lutheran World Federation operates Lutheran World Relief, a relief and development agency active in more than 50 countries.
Catechism instruction is considered foundational in most Lutheran churches. Almost all maintain Sunday Schools, and some host or maintain Lutheran schools, at the preschool, elementary, middle, high school, folk high school, or university level. Lifelong study of the catechism is intended for all ages so that the abuses of the pre-Reformation Church will not recur.&#91;215&#93; Lutheran schools have always been a core aspect of Lutheran mission work, starting with Bartholomew Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Putschasu, who began work in India in year 1706.&#91;216&#93; During the Counter-Reformation era in German speaking areas, backstreet Lutheran schools were the main Lutheran institution among crypto-Lutherans.&#91;217&#93;
Pastors almost always have substantial theological educations, including Koine Greek and Biblical Hebrew so that they can refer to the Christian scriptures in the original language. Pastors usually teach in the common language of the local congregation. In the U.S., some congregations and synods historically taught in German, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, or Swedish, but retention of immigrant languages has been in significant decline since the early and middle 20th century.
Lutherans were divided about the issue of church fellowship for the first thirty years after Luther's death. Philipp Melanchthon and his Philippist party felt that Christians of different beliefs should join in union with each other without completely agreeing on doctrine. Against them stood the Gnesio-Lutherans, led by Matthias Flacius and the faculty at the University of Jena. They condemned the Philippist position for indifferentism, describing it as a "unionistic compromise" of precious Reformation theology. Instead, they held that genuine unity between Christians and real theological peace was only possible with an honest agreement about every subject of doctrinal controversy.&#91;218&#93;
Complete agreement finally came about in 1577, after the death of both Melanchthon and Flacius, when a new generation of theologians resolved the doctrinal controversies on the basis of Scripture in the Formula of Concord of 1577.&#91;219&#93; Although they decried the visible division of Christians on earth, orthodox Lutherans avoided ecumenical fellowship with other churches, believing that Christians should not, for example, join together for the Lord's Supper or exchange pastors if they do not completely agree about what the Bible teaches. In the 17th century, Georgius Calixtus began a rebellion against this practice, sparking the Syncretistic Controversy with Abraham Calovius as his main opponent.&#91;220&#93;
In the 18th century, there was some ecumenical interest between the Church of Sweden and the Church of England. John Robinson, Bishop of London, planned for a union of the English and Swedish churches in 1718. The plan failed because most Swedish bishops rejected the Calvinism of the Church of England, although Jesper Swedberg and Johannes Gezelius the younger, bishops of Skara, Sweden and Turku, Finland, were in favor.&#91;221&#93; With the encouragement of Swedberg, church fellowship was established between Swedish Lutherans and Anglicans in the Middle Colonies. Over the course of the 1700s and the early 1800s, Swedish Lutherans were absorbed into Anglican churches, with the last original Swedish congregation completing merger into the Episcopal Church in 1846.&#91;222&#93;
In the 19th century, Samuel Simon Schmucker attempted to lead the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States toward unification with other American Protestants. His attempt to get the synod to reject the Augsburg Confession in favor of his compromising Definite Platform failed. Instead, it sparked a Neo-Lutheran revival, prompting many to form the General Council, including Charles Porterfield Krauth. Their alternative approach was "Lutheran pulpits for Lutheran ministers only and Lutheran altars...for Lutheran communicants only."&#91;223&#93;
Beginning in 1867, confessional and liberal minded Lutherans in Germany joined together to form the Common Evangelical Lutheran Conference against the ever looming prospect of a state-mandated union with the Reformed.&#91;224&#93; However, they failed to reach consensus on the degree of shared doctrine necessary for church union.&#91;34&#93; Eventually, the fascist German Christians movement pushed the final national merger of Lutheran, Union, and Reformed church bodies into a single Reich Church in 1933, doing away with the previous umbrella German Evangelical Church Confederation (DEK). As part of denazification the Reich Church was formally done away with in 1945, and certain clergy were removed from their positions. However, the merger between the Lutheran, United, and Reformed state churches was retained under the name Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). In 1948 the Lutheran church bodies within the EKD founded the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany (VELKD), but it has since been reduced from being an independent legal entity to an administrative unit within the EKD.
Presently, Lutherans are divided over how to interact with other Christian denominations. Some Lutherans assert that everyone must share the "whole counsel of God" (Acts 20:27) in complete unity (1 Cor. 1:10)&#91;225&#93; before pastors can share each other's pulpits, and before communicants commune at each other's altars, a practice termed closed (or close) communion. On the other hand, other Lutherans practice varying degrees of open communion and allow preachers from other Christian denominations in their pulpits.
While not an issue in the majority of Lutheran church bodies, some of them forbid membership in Freemasonry. Partly, this is because the lodge is viewed as spreading Unitarianism, as the Brief Statement of the LCMS reads, "Hence we warn against Unitarianism, which in our country has to a great extent impenetrated the sects and is being spread particularly also through the influence of the lodges."&#91;226&#93; A 1958 report from the publishing house of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod states that, "Masonry is guilty of idolatry. Its worship and prayers are idol worship. The Masons may not with their hands have made an idol out of gold, silver, wood or stone, but they created one with their own mind and reason out of purely human thoughts and ideas. The latter is an idol no less than the former."&#91;227&#93;
The largest organizations of Lutheran churches around the world are the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum, the International Lutheran Council (ILC), and the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC). These organizations together account for the great majority of Lutheran denominations. The LCMS and the Lutheran Church–Canada are members of the ILC. The WELS and ELS are members of the CELC. Many Lutheran churches are not affiliated with the LWF, the ILC or the CELC: The congregations of the Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC) are affiliated with their mission organizations in Canada, India, Nepal, Myanmar, and many African nations; and those affiliated with the Church of the Lutheran Brethren are especially active doing mission work in Africa and East Asia.
The Lutheran World Federation-aligned churches do not believe that one church is singularly true in its teachings. According to this belief, Lutheranism is a reform movement rather than a movement into doctrinal correctness. As part of this, in 1999 the LWF and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, that stated that the LWF and the Catholics both agreed about certain basics of Justification and lifted certain Catholic anathemas formerly applying to the LWF member churches.The LCMS has participated in most of the official dialogues with the Roman Catholic Church since shortly after the Second Vatican Council, though not the one which produced the Joint Declaration and to which they were not invited. While some Lutheran theologians saw the Joint Declaration as a sign that the Catholics were essentially adopting the Lutheran position, other Lutheran theologians disagreed, claiming that, considering the public documentation of the Catholic position, this assertion does not hold up.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Besides their intra-Lutheran arrangements, some member churches of the LWF have also declared full communion with non-Lutheran Protestant churches. The Porvoo Communion is a communion of episcopally led Lutheran and Anglican churches in Europe. Beside its membership in the Porvoo Communion, Church of Sweden also has declared full communion with the Philippine Independent Church and the United Methodist Church.&#91;citation needed&#93; The state Protestant churches in Germany many other European countries have signed the Leuenberg Agreement to form the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has been involved in ecumenical dialogues with several denominations. The ELCA has declared full communion with multiple American Protestant churches.&#91;228&#93;
Although on paper the LWF churches have all declared have full communion with each other, in practice some churches within the LWF have renounced ties with specific other churches.&#91;229&#93; One development in this ongoing schism is the Global Confessional and Missional Lutheran Forum, which consists of churches and church related organizations tracing their heritage back to mainline American Lutheranism in North America, European state churches, as well as certain African churches. As of 2019, the Forum is not a full communion organization. Similar in this structure is the International Lutheran Council, where issues of communion are left to the individual denominations. Not all ILC churches have declared church-fellowship with each other. In contrast, mutual church-fellowship is part of the CELC member churches, and unlike in the LWF, this is not contradicted by individual statements from any particular member church body.
Laestadians within certain European state churches maintain close ties to other Laestadians, often called Apostolic Lutherans. Altogether, Laestadians are found in 23 countries across five continents, but there is no single organization which represents them. Laestadians operate Peace Associations to coordinate their churchly efforts. Nearly all are located in Europe, although they there are 15 combined in North America, Ecuador, Togo, and Kenya.
By contrast, the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference and International Lutheran Council as well as some unaffiliated denominations such as the Church of the Lutheran Confession and North American Laestadians maintain that the orthodox confessional Lutheran churches are the only churches with completely correct doctrine. They teach that while other Christian churches teach partially orthodox doctrine and have true Christians as members, the doctrines of those churches contain significant errors. More conservative Lutherans strive to maintain historical distinctiveness while emphasizing doctrinal purity alongside Gospel-motivated outreach. They claim that LWF Lutherans are practicing "fake ecumenism" by desiring church fellowship outside of actual unity of teaching.&#91;230&#93;
Although not an "ecumenical" movement in the formal sense, in the 1990s influences from the megachurches of American evangelicalism have become somewhat common. Many of the largest Lutheran congregations in the United States have been heavily influenced by these "progressive Evangelicals." These influences are sharply criticized by some Lutherans as being foreign to orthodox Lutheran beliefs.&#91;231&#93;
Lutheran polity varies depending on influences. Although Article XIV of the Augsburg Confession mandates that one must be "properly called" to preach or administer the Sacraments, some Lutherans have a broad view of on what constitutes this and thus allow lay preaching or students still studying to be pastors someday to consecrate the Lord's Supper.&#91;232&#93; Despite considerable diversity, Lutheran polity trends in a geographically predictable manner in Europe, with episcopal governance to the north and east but blended and consistorial-presbyterian type synodical governance in Germany.
To the north in Scandinavia, the population was more insulated from the influence and politics of the Reformation and thus the Church of Sweden (which at the time included Finland) retained the Apostolic succession,&#91;233&#93; although they did not consider it essential for valid sacraments as the Donatists did in the fourth and fifth centuries and the Roman Catholics do today. Recently, the Swedish succession was introduced into all of the Porvoo Communion churches, all of which have an episcopal polity. Although the Lutheran churches did not require this or change their doctrine, this was important in order for more strictly high church Anglican individuals to feel comfortable recognizing their sacraments as valid. The occasional ordination of a bishop by a priest was not necessarily considered an invalid ordination in the Middle Ages, so the alleged break in the line of succession in the other Nordic Churches would have been considered a violation of canon law rather than an invalid ordination at the time.  Moreover, there are no consistent records detailing pre-Reformation ordinations prior to the 12th century.&#91;234&#93;
In the far north of the Scandinavian peninsula are the Sámi people, some of which practice a form of Lutheranism called Apostolic Lutheranism, or Laestadianism due to the efforts of Lars Levi Laestadius. However, others are Orthodox in religion. Some Apostolic Lutherans consider their movement as part of an unbroken line down from the Apostles. In areas where Apostolic Lutherans have their own bishops apart from other Lutheran church organizations, the bishops wield more practical authority than Lutheran clergy typically do. In Russia, Laestadians of Lutheran background cooperate with the Ingrian church, but since Laestadianism is an interdenominational movement, some are Eastern Orthodox. Eastern Orthodox Laestadians are known as Ushkovayzet (article is in Russian).&#91;235&#93;
Although historically Pietism had a significant influence on the understanding of the ministry among Lutherans in the Russian Empire,&#91;b&#93; today nearly all Russian and Ukrainian Lutherans are influenced by Eastern Orthodox polity. In their culture, giving a high degree of respect and authority to their bishops is necessary for their faith to be seen as legitimate and not sectarian.&#91;236&#93; In Russia, lines of succession between bishops and the canonical authority between their present-day hierarchy is also carefully maintained in order to legitimize the existing Lutheran churches as present day successors of the former Lutheran Church of the Russian Empire originally authorized by Catherine the Great. This allows for the post-Soviet repatriation of Lutheran church buildings to local congregations on the basis of this historical connection.&#91;237&#93;
In Germany, several dynamics encouraged Lutherans to maintain a different form of polity. First, due to de facto practice during the Nuremberg Religious Peace the subsequent legal principal of Cuius regio, eius religio in the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, German states were officially either Catholic or "Evangelical" (that is, Lutheran under the Augsburg Confession). In some areas both Catholic and Lutheran churches were permitted to co-exist. Because German speaking Catholic areas were nearby Catholic leaning Christians were able to emigrate and there was less of an issue with Catholics choosing to live as crypto-papists in Lutheran areas. Although Reformed leaning Christians were not allowed to have churches, Melancthon wrote Augsburg Confession Variata which some used to claim legal protection as "Evangelical" churches. Many chose to live as crypto-Calvinists either with or without the protection offered by the Variata, but this did not make their influence go away, and as a result the Protestant church in Germany as of 2017 was only about ~40% Lutheran, with most of the rest being United Protestant, a combination of Lutheran and Reformed beliefs and practices.&#91;238&#93;
In terms of polity, over 17th and 18th centuries the carefully negotiated and highly prescriptive church orders of the Reformation era gave way to a joint cooperation between state control and a Reformed-style blend of consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. Just as negotiations over the details in the church orders involved the laity, so did the new synodical governance. Synodical governance had already been practiced in the Reformed Netherlands prior to its adoption by Lutherans. During the formation of the modern German state, ideas about the nature of authority and the best design for governments and organizations came from the philosophies Kant and Hegel, further modifying the polity. When the monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches.
During the period of the emigration, Lutherans took their existing ideas about polity with them across the ocean,&#91;240&#93;&#91;241&#93; though with the exception of the early Swedish Lutherans immigrants of the New Sweden colony who accepted the rule of the Anglican bishops and became part of the established church, they now had to fund churches on their own. This increased the congregationalist dynamic in the blended consistorial and presbyterian type synodical governance. The first organized church body of Lutherans in America was the Pennsylvania Ministerium, which used Reformed style synodical governance over the 18th and 19th centuries. Their contribution to the development of polity was that smaller synods could in turn form a larger body, also with synodical governance, but without losing their lower level of governance. As a result, the smaller synods gained unprecedented flexibility to join, leave, merge, or stay separate, all without the hand of the state as had been the case in Europe.
During their 19th century persecution, Old Lutheran believers were left in a bind. Resistance to authority was disobedient, but upholding the true doctrine and right practice was also disobedient. Fortunately the doctrine of the lesser magistrate could be employed, whereby clergy could legitimately resist the state and even leave. illegal free churches were set up in Germany and mass emigration occurred. For decades the new churches were mostly dependent on the free churches to send them new ministerial candidates for ordination. These new church bodies also employed synodical governance, but tended to exclude Hegelianism in their constitutions due to its incompatibility with the doctrine of the lesser magistrates. In contrast to Hegelianism where authority flows in from all levels, Kantianism presents authority flowing only from the top down, hence the need for a lesser magistrate to become the new top magistrate.
Over the 20th and 20th century, some Lutheran bodies have adopted a more congregationalist approach, such as the Protest'ant Conference and the Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ, or LCMC. The LCMC formed due to a church split after the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America signed an agreement with the Episcopalians to start ordaining all of their new bishops into the Episcopalian Apostolic succession. In other words, this meant that new ELCA bishops, at least at first, would be jointly ordained by Anglican bishops as well as Lutheran bishops so that the more strict Episcopalians would recognize their sacraments as valid. This was offensive to some in the ELCA at the time because of the implications this had on the priesthood of all believers and the nature of ordination.
Today, some churches allow dual-rostering.&#91;242&#93; Situations like this one where a church or church body belongs to multiple larger organizations that do not have ties are termed "triangular fellowship." Another variant are independent Lutheran churches, although for some independent churches the clergy are members of a larger denomination. In other cases, a congregation may belong to a synod, but the pastor may be unaffiliated.&#91;243&#93; In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,&#91;244&#93; the Wisconsin Synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, and the Missouri Synod, teachers at parochial schools are considered to be ministers of religion, with the latter defending this before the Supreme Court in 2012. However, differences remain in the precise status the status of their teachers.&#91;245&#93;
Today, millions belong to Lutheran churches, which are present on all populated continents.&#91;246&#93; The Lutheran World Federation estimates the total membership of its churches over 74 ;million.&#91;247&#93; This figure miscounts Lutherans worldwide as not all Lutheran churches belong to this organization, and many members of merged LWF church bodies do not self-identify as Lutheran or attend congregations that self-identify as Lutheran.&#91;248&#93; Lutheran churches in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean regions are experiencing decreases and no growth in membership, while those in Africa and Asia continue to grow. Lutheranism is the largest religious group in Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Namibia, and North Dakota and South Dakota in the United States. 
Lutheranism is also the dominant form of Christianity in the White Mountain and San Carlos Apache nations. In addition, Lutheranism is a main Protestant denomination in Germany (behind United Protestant (Lutheran &amp; Reformed) churches; EKD Protestants form about 25.5% of the country's total population),&#91;238&#93; Estonia, Poland, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Papua New Guinea, and Tanzania.&#91;249&#93; Although some convents and monasteries voluntarily closed during the Reformation, and many of the remaining damenstift were shuttered by communist authorities following World War II, the Lüne abbeys are still open. Nearly all active Lutheran orders are located in Europe.
Although Namibia is the only country outside Europe to have a Lutheran majority, there are sizable Lutheran bodies in other African countries. In the following African countries, the total number of Lutherans exceeds 100,000: Nigeria, Central African Republic, Chad, Kenya, Malawi, Congo, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Madagascar. In addition, the following nations also have sizable Lutheran populations: Canada, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Brazil, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, the Netherlands (as a synod within the PKN and two strictly Lutheran denominations), South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, especially in the heavily German and Scandinavian Upper Midwest.&#91;250&#93;&#91;251&#93;
Lutheranism is also a state religion in Iceland, Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Finland has its Lutheran church established as a national church. Similarly, Sweden also has its national church, which was a state church until 2000.&#91;252&#93;

Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, Merseyside, England, which has a seating capacity of 54,074, making it the seventh largest football stadium in England.&#91;4&#93; It has been the home of Liverpool F.C. since their formation in 1892. It was originally the home of Everton F.C. from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president.&#91;5&#93;
The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End.&#91;6&#93; The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952.&#91;7&#93; The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.
Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the stadium: Shankly's unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley's in 2020 by the Main Stand. The ground is 2 miles (3 ;km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station. It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen.
Construction for an extension to the Main Stand began on 8 December 2014.&#91;8&#93; This extension which opened to the public on 9 September 2016 increased the stadium capacity to 54,074, making it one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football.&#91;9&#93; There are future plans to expand the Anfield Road Stand which would bring the stadium size to around 61,000.&#91;10&#93;
The name Anfield comes from the old town land of "Annefield" outside New Ross, County Wexford in Ireland.&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93; Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally owned by John Orrell, a minor land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding.&#91;13&#93; Everton, who previously played at Priory Road, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the crowd on match days.&#91;14&#93; Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent. The first match at the ground was between Everton and Earlestown on 28 September 1884, which Everton won 5–0.&#91;15&#93; During Everton's tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did. The ground was considered of international standard at the time, playing host to the British Home Championship match between England and Ireland in 1889. Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and Accrington F.C. Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the 1890–91 season.&#91;16&#93;
In 1892, negotiations to purchase the land at Anfield from Orrell escalated into a dispute between Houlding and the Everton F.C. committee over how the club was run. Events culminated in Everton's move to Goodison Park.&#91;14&#93; Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to form a new club to occupy it. The new team was called Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd, and the club's first match at Anfield was a friendly played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against Rotherham Town. Liverpool won 7–1.&#91;17&#93;
Liverpool's first Football League match at Anfield was played on 9 September 1893, against Lincoln City. Liverpool won 4–0 in front of 5,000 ;spectators.&#91;18&#93; A new stand capable of holding 3,000 ;spectators was constructed in 1895 on the site of the present Main Stand. Designed by architect Archibald Leitch,&#91;19&#93; the stand had a distinctive red and white gable, and was similar to the main stand at Newcastle United's ground St James' Park.&#91;17&#93; Another stand was constructed at the Anfield Road end in 1903, built from timber and corrugated iron. After Liverpool had won their second League championship in 1906, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, named it the Spion Kop; it was named after a famous hill in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War in 1900. More than 300 ;men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. Around the same period a stand was also built along Kemlyn Road.&#91;20&#93;
The ground remained much the same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000 ;spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well.&#91;21&#93; Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop in the country at the time—it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.&#91;22&#93; In the same year the topmast of the SS ;Great Eastern, one of the first iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole.&#91;20&#93;
Floodlights were installed at a cost of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association.&#91;22&#93; In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built at a cost of £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators.&#91;23&#93; Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973.&#91;23&#93; In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked them for the first time on 26 August 1982.&#91;20&#93; Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.&#91;24&#93;
Coloured seats and a police room were added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994.&#91;25&#93; A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000 ;seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action.&#91;26&#93; The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.&#91;22&#93;
On 4 December 1997, a bronze statue of Bill Shankly was unveiled at the visitors' centre in front of the Kop. Standing at over 8 feet (2.4 ;m) tall, the statue depicts Shankly with a fan's scarf around his neck, in a familiar pose he adopted when receiving applause from fans. Inscribed on the statue are the words "Bill Shankly – He Made The People Happy".&#91;27&#93; The Hillsborough memorial was situated alongside the Shankly Gates before it was moved next to 96 Avenue in front of the redeveloped main stand in 2016.&#91;28&#93; The memorial is always decorated with flowers and tributes to the 96 ;people who died in 1989 as a result of the disaster. At the centre of the memorial is an eternal flame, signifying that those who died will never be forgotten.&#91;28&#93;
In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has encountered a number of problems since its redevelopment; at the beginning of the 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.&#91;29&#93;
On 30 January 2020, a bronze statue of Bob Paisley was unveiled outside the Main Stand in Paisley Square. The statue was commissioned and donated by the club's main sponsor, Standard Chartered, to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the relationship with the club.&#91;30&#93; The statue is 8 ;ft (2.4 ;m) tall and depicts an iconic image of the club's history, Paisley carrying future club captain Emlyn Hughes off the field during a match against Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield in April 1968.&#91;31&#93;
Anfield comprises 54,074 seats split between four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is single-tiered and the Main Stand three-tiered.&#91;32&#93; Entry to the stadium is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional manned turnstile. This system, used in all 80 ;turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.&#91;33&#93;
The oldest stand at Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was completed in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box is located at the rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier &#91;40&#93; The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating "THIS IS ANFIELD". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.&#91;41&#93;
The sign was temporarily removed during the most recent reconstruction of the Main Stand; it was placed at the exit from the new Main Stand tunnel to the pitch in advance of Liverpool's 2016–17 home opener.&#91;42&#93; Current Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had banned players from touching the restored sign until the team had won at least one major trophy.&#91;43&#93; After winning the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final players are now allowed to do so again.&#91;44&#93; Praising the impact the Anfield atmosphere has on the home team and the effect it has on the away team, opposition manager Pep Guardiola states, “The motto ‘This is Anfield’ is no marketing spin. There's something about it that you will find in no other stadium in the world.”&#91;45&#93;
The Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand is a two-tiered stand. Originally a single-tiered stand called the Kemlyn Road Stand, the second tier was added in 1992 to coincide with the club's centenary.&#91;46&#93; It is located opposite the Main Stand and houses directors' boxes, which are between the two tiers. The stand also houses the ground's police station.&#91;32&#93; On 3 May 2017, Liverpool announced the Centenary Stand would be renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand in honour of the club's greatest servant, former player and manager Kenny Dalglish.&#91;47&#93;
The Anfield Road stand, on the left side of the Main Stand, houses the away fans during matches. The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982. Originally a single-tier stand, a further revamp, which was completed in 1998, gave the stand a second-tier providing additional seating.&#91;46&#93;
There are 59 ;spaces available in the stadium to accommodate wheelchair users who have season tickets; a further 33 spaces are available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters. These spaces are located in the Main Stand, Anfield Road Stand and The Kop. There are 38 ;spaces available for the visually impaired, which are situated in the old paddock area of the Main Stand, with space for one personal assistant each. A headset with full commentary is provided.&#91;48&#93;
The stadium features tributes to two of the club's most successful managers. The Paisley Gateway is a tribute to Bob Paisley, who guided Liverpool to three European Cups and six League Championships in the 1970s, and 1980s. The gates were erected at the Kop; their design includes representations of the three European Cups Paisley won during his tenure, the crest of his birthplace in Hetton-le-Hole, and the crest of Liverpool F.C.&#91;49&#93; The Shankly Gates, in tribute of Bill Shankly, Paisley's predecessor between 1959 and 1974, are at the Anfield Road end. Their design includes a Scottish flag, a Scottish thistle, the Liverpool badge, and the words "You'll Never Walk Alone".&#91;50&#93;
Anfield stadium is a UEFA category 4 stadium.&#91;51&#93;
Plans to replace Anfield were originally started by Liverpool F.C. in May 2002.&#91;52&#93; The proposed capacity was 55,000, but it was later changed to 61,000, with 1,000 ;seats given for segregation between home and away fans. Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the Liverpool City Council to instigate a groundshare of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it.&#91;53&#93; On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission to build a new stadium 300 yards (270 ;m) away from Anfield at Stanley Park.&#91;54&#93; On 8 September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool F.C. a 999-year lease of the land on the proposed site.&#91;55&#93;
Following the takeover of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout was approved by the council, and construction was due to start in early 2008.&#91;56&#93; The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000.&#91;57&#93; If the new stadium had been built, Anfield would have been demolished. The land would have become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would have included a hotel, restaurants, and offices.&#91;58&#93; However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, and interest rates were higher than expected.&#91;59&#93; Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60 ;days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500 ;million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.&#91;60&#93;
On 23 April 2014, Liverpool F.C. revealed plans for an expansion of the Main Stand, which involved adding new third tier, new matchday facilities and enhanced corporate facilities. The new stand would add 8,500 seats and take the capacity of the stadium to 54,742.&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93; Work began on 8 December 2014, with the club aiming for the new stand to be match-ready and operational for the start of the 2016–17 season. The work was undertaken by Carillion. The structure of new stand was uniquely constructed around the existing main stand to enable the existing stand to continue to be used at full operational capacity during the 2015–16 season.&#91;68&#93; Demolition of the existing stand took place in summer 2016, allowing for the construction of the lower tiers of the new stand during the off-season. Consisting of 1.8 ;million bricks and blocks and over 5000 tonnes of steel, the stand was opened on schedule on 9 September 2016 for the first home game of the 2016–17 season, a 4–1 victory over Leicester City. Further internal construction work including new changing rooms and media facilities continued until April 2017.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;
In May 2016, outline planning permission  was granted by Liverpool council for the construction of a new 1,800 sq m club superstore development, situated on Walton Breck Road on the corner of the Kop and the new Main Stand. Construction began in December 2016, with the store opening early in the 2017–18 season.&#91;71&#93; The space between the new store and the stadium was developed into a "fan zone", with new catering outlets and pre-match entertainment.&#91;72&#93;
The second phase of Anfield's redevelopment is to redevelop the Anfield Road stand. The club received initial outline planning permission in 2014 for the redevelopment, with seating to be increased by 4,825, giving  Anfield a total capacity of 58,000.&#91;73&#93; However, in August 2019, Liverpool allowed the planning permission associated with the original 2014 designs to lapse, confirming their intention to submit "ambitious new plans" for the Anfield Road End redevelopment which are believed to increase the capacity further to take the overall capacity of Anfield to comfortably above 60,000.&#91;74&#93; The club is currently finalising plans and consulting local residents, planning officials and other stakeholders with a view to submitting the new plans for approval in the near future.&#91;75&#93;&#91;76&#93; If everything goes according to plan, it is estimated that work will begin at the end of 2020 and be completed in the summer of 2022.&#91;77&#93; The redevelopment will focus on the upper tier of the stand, with the lower tier remaining unchanged. Construction work will be completed behind the existing stand and, according to current plans, will be connected to the lower tier in the off-season in 2022. Therefore, Anfield's capacity is not expected to be affected throughout the duration of the works.&#91;78&#93;
Anfield has hosted numerous international matches, and was one of the venues used during UEFA Euro 1996; the ground hosted three group games and a quarter-final.&#91;79&#93; The first international match hosted at Anfield was between England and Ireland, in 1889. England won the match 6–1. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England's international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the Welsh national team in the later part of that century.&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93; Anfield has also played host to five FA Cup semi-finals, the last of which was in 1929.&#91;80&#93; The most recent international to be hosted at Anfield was England's 2–1 victory over Uruguay on 1 March 2006.&#91;82&#93; England has played two testimonial matches against Liverpool at Anfield. The first was in 1983, when England faced Liverpool for Phil Thompson's testimonial. Then, in 1988, England visited again for Alan Hansen's testimonial.&#91;83&#93; Liverpool's arch rival Manchester United played their first home game of the 1971–72 season at Anfield as they were banned from playing their first two home league matches at Old Trafford after an incident of hooliganism. United beat Arsenal 3–1.&#91;84&#93;
In November 2019, Anfield hosted a Women's Super League fixture for the first time, with the 6th matchday of the 2019–20 season featuring a derby between Liverpool FC Women and local rivals Everton FC Women.&#91;85&#93;
The stadium has hosted five rugby league matches: the 1989 Charity Shield between Widnes and Wigan;&#91;86&#93; the 1991 World Club Challenge between Wigan, winners of the RFL Championship, and Penrith Panthers, winners of the Australian NSWRL Premiership, with an attendance of 20,152;&#91;87&#93; a 1997 St. Helens  Super League home game against Castleford Tigers, with an attendance of 12,329;&#91;87&#93;  and the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations Final, in front of 40,042 people.&#91;87&#93;
Anfield was chosen as the venue for the 2019 Magic Weekend after two test matches were played there in 2016 and 2018. After previously choosing games that were local derbies or competitive games, in 2019 the fixtures were determined by the previous seasons league position. Robert Elstone, Super League Chief Executive, said “On behalf of the Super League clubs, we’re delighted to be taking the Dacia Magic Weekend to one of the most famous stadiums in the world.&#91;88&#93;
Anfield has been the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the finishing line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield.&#91;80&#93; Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters was held at the ground.&#91;89&#93;
Aside from sporting uses, Anfield has been a venue for musicians of different genres as well as evangelical preachers. One week in July 1984, the American evangelist Billy Graham preached at Anfield, attracting crowds of over 30,000 each night.&#91;80&#93; Anfield was featured in Liverpool's 2008 European Capital of Culture celebrations: 36,000 people attended a concert on 1 June 2008, featuring The Zutons, Kaiser Chiefs, and Paul McCartney.&#91;90&#93; Live concerts made a return to Anfield in the Summer of 2019, with Take That, Bon Jovi and Pink performing. Take That lead singer Gary Barlow, a Liverpool fan, brought out a guest vocalist, Gerry Marsden, and they sang the club's anthem “You'll Never Walk Alone”.&#91;91&#93;
The highest attendance recorded at Anfield is 61,905, for Liverpool's match against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fifth round, on 2 February 1952.&#91;92&#93; The lowest attendance recorded at Anfield was 1,000 for a match against Loughborough on 7 December 1895.&#91;93&#93; The highest average attendance of 53,112 was set for the 2016–17 season.&#91;46&#93;
Liverpool did not lose a match at Anfield during the 1893–94, 1970–71, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1987–88, 2008–09, 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons. Liverpool's longest unbeaten streak at home extended from January 1978 to January 1981, a period encompassing 85 games, in which Liverpool scored 212 goals and conceded 35.&#91;92&#93; Liverpool's worst losing streak at Anfield is three games. This has occurred three times in the club's history to date (1899–1900, 1906–07 and 1908–09 seasons).&#91;94&#93; The most consecutive league wins at Anfield is 22, this is the longest run in English top-flight history. It has been accomplished across the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons.&#91;95&#93; This mark overtook the previous record of 21 which was also set by Liverpool across the 1971–72 and 1972–73 seasons.&#91;96&#93;
The stadium is about 2 miles (3 ;km) from Lime Street Station,&#91;97&#93; which lies on a branch of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston. Kirkdale Station, about 1 mile (1.6 ;km) from the stadium, is the nearest station to Anfield. Fans travelling by train for matches may book direct to Anfield or Goodison Park, changing to the Peoplesbus Soccerbus service at Sandhills Station on the Merseyrail Northern Line.&#91;98&#93; The stadium has no parking facilities for supporters, and the streets around the ground allow parking only for residents with permits, although there are a small number of passes that can be allocated to over-65s. There are proposals under consideration for reinstating passenger traffic on the Bootle Branch, which would cut the distance from the nearest railway station to about 0.5 miles (1 ;km).&#91;99&#93;

Pope Alexander VII (13 February 1599 ;&#8211;&#32;22 May 1667), born Fabio Chigi, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 7 April 1655 to his death in 1667.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;
He began his career as a vice-papal legate, and he held various diplomatic positions in the Holy See. He was ordained as a priest in 1634, and he became bishop of Nardo in 1635. He was later transferred in 1652, and he became bishop of Imola. Pope Innocent X made him secretary of state in 1651, and in 1652, he was appointed a cardinal.
Early in his papacy, Alexander, who was seen as an anti-nepotist at the time of his election, lived simply; later, however, he gave jobs to his relatives, who eventually took over his administration.
His administration worked to support the Jesuits. However, his administration's relations with France were strained due to his frictions with French diplomats.
Alexander was interested in architecture and supported various urban projects in Rome. He also wrote poetry and patronized artists who expanded the decoration of churches. His theological writings included discussions of heliocentrism and the Immaculate Conception.
Born in Siena, a member of the illustrious banking family of Chigi and a great-nephew of Pope Paul V (1605–1621),&#91;3&#93; Fabio Chigi was privately tutored and eventually received doctorates of philosophy, law, and theology from the University of Siena.
Fabio's elder brother, Mario, married Berenice, the daughter of Tiberio della Ciala, producing four children, of whom two survived: Agnes and Flavio.  Flavio (1631-1693) was created cardinal by his uncle on April 9, 1657. His brother, Augusto Chigi (1595-1651), married Olimpia della Ciaia (1614-1640) and continued the family line as the parents of Agostino Chigi, Prince Farnese. Fabio's sister Onorata Mignanelli married Firmano Bichi; their son Antonio was named Bishop of Montalcino (1652-1656) and then Osimo (1656-1659), and was named a cardinal by his Uncle Alexander VII (in pectore) on April 9, 1657 (made public on 10 November 1659).&#91;4&#93;  Another of his nephews was Giovanni Bichi, whom he appointed Admiral of the Papal Navy.&#91;5&#93;
In 1627 he began his apprenticeship as vice-papal legate at Ferrara, and on recommendations from two cardinals he was appointed Inquisitor of Malta.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;
Chigi was ordained a priest in December 1634.  He was appointed Referendarius utriusque signaturae, which made him a prelate and gave him the right to practice before the Roman courts.  On 8 January 1635, Chigi was named Bishop of Nardò in southern Italy and consecrated on 1 July 1635&#91;8&#93; by Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa, Bishop of Malta.&#91;9&#93;  On 13 May 1652 he was transferred to the Bishopric of Imola.&#91;8&#93;
Bishop Chigi was named nuncio in Cologne (1639–1651) on 11 June 1639.  There, he supported Urban VIII's condemnation of the heretical book Augustinus by Cornelius Jansen, Bishop of Ypres, in the papal Bull In eminenti of 1642.&#91;10&#93;
Though expected to take part in the negotiations which led in 1648 to the Peace of Westphalia, Bishop Chigi (and other Catholic delegates) declined to deliberate with persons whom the Catholic Church considered heretics. Negotiations therefore took place in two cities, Osnabrück and Münster in Westphalia, with intermediaries travelling back and forth between the Protestant and the Catholic delegates.  Chigi, of course, protested on behalf of the Papacy, when the treaties were finally completed, against the Treaty of Westphalia once the instruments were finally completed.&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93;  Pope Innocent himself stated that the Peace  "is null, void, invalid, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all time."&#91;13&#93; The Peace ended the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) and established the balance of European power that lasted until the wars of the French Revolution (1789).
Pope Innocent X (1644–1655) recalled Chigi to Rome.  In December 1651 Pope Innocent named Cardinal Chigi Secretary of State.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; He was created cardinal by Innocent X in the Consistory of 19 February 1652, and on 12 March was granted the title of Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria del Popolo.&#91;16&#93;
When Innocent X died on 1 January 1655, Cardinal Chigi was elected pope after eighty days in the conclave, on 7 April 1655, taking the name of Alexander VII.&#91;17&#93;
The conclave believed he was strongly opposed to the nepotism that had been a feature of previous popes. Indeed, in the first year of his reign, Alexander VII lived simply and forbade his relations even to visit Rome. A contemporary, John Bargrave (having visited Rome during the period following his election and then later during his papacy) wrote the following:&#91;18&#93;
The prose may be grossly exaggerated, as the view of a Protestant clergyman and nephew of the Dean of Canterbury,  but, indeed, it is at least true that in the consistory of 24 April 1656 Pope Alexander announced that his brother and nephews would be coming to assist him in Rome.  His nephew, Cardinal Flavio Chigi assumed the position of cardinal-nephew.  The administration was given largely into the hands of his relatives,&#91;19&#93; and nepotism became as luxuriously entrenched as it ever had been in the Baroque Papacy: he gave them the best-paid civil and ecclesiastical offices,&#91;example  needed&#93; and princely palaces and estates suitable to the Chigi of Siena.&#91;citation needed&#93;  Cardinal Flavio began work on the Villa Chigi-Versaglia at Formello in 1664.&#91;20&#93;
A number of pontifs are renowned for their urban planning in the city of Rome—for example, Pope Julius II and Pope Sixtus V—but Alexander VII's numerous urban interventions were not only diverse in scope and scale but demonstrated a consistent planning and architectural vision that the glorification and embellishment of the city, ancient and modern, sacred and secular, should be governed by order and decorum.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;
Central to Alexander's urbanism was the idea of teatro or urban theatre&#91;23&#93; whereby his urban interventions became the grand settings or showpieces appropriate to the dignity of Rome and the Head of the Catholic Church. Therefore, and although the scales are vastly different, the small Santa Maria della Pace and its piazza are as much a teatro as the imposing monumental colonnade that forms Piazza San Pietro in front of St. Peter's Basilica.
The various urban and architectural projects carried out during Alexander's reign were recorded in engravings by Giovanni Battista Falda and the first volume was published in 1665. The volumes were published by Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi under the title Il Nuovo Teatro delle fabriche et edificij in prospettiva di Roma moderna sotto il felice pontificato di N.S. Alessandro VII.&#91;24&#93;  A rival publication documenting these projects was published by Rossi's cousin Giovanni Battista de Rossi who employed the young Flemish architectural draughtsman Lieven Cruyl to produce drawings of Rome, 10 of which were published in 1666 under the title Prospectus Locorum Urbis Romae Insignium.&#91;25&#93;
His preferred architect was the sculptor and architect Gianlorenzo Bernini&#91;26&#93; but he also gave architectural commissions to the painter and architect Pietro da Cortona. Of the three leading architects of the Roman High Baroque, only Francesco Borromini fared not so well under Alexander; this may be because he thought Borromini's architectural forms willful but also Borromini could be notoriously difficult. Nonetheless, Alexander's family heraldic emblems of the mons or mountains with stars and oak leaves, adorn Borromini's&#91;27&#93; church of Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza and many other works of his reign.&#91;28&#93;
Before being elected as Pontiff, Chigi served as Inquisitor on the Island of Malta where he resided mostly at The Inquisitor's Palace in Birgu (alias Città Vittoriosa). At that time Malta was a fiefdom of the Knights Hospitallers of the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Knights of Malta.
The conversion of Queen Christina of Sweden (1632–1654) occurred during Alexander VII's reign. After her abdication the queen came to reside in Rome, where she was confirmed in her baptism by the Pope, in whom she found a generous friend and benefactor, on Christmas Day, 1655.
In foreign policy his instincts were not as humanist or as successful. Alexander VII's pontificate was shadowed by continual friction with Cardinal Mazarin, adviser to Louis XIV of France (1643–1715), who had opposed him during the negotiations that led to the Peace of Westphalia and who defended the prerogatives of the Gallican Church. During the conclave, he had been hostile to Chigi's election, but was in the end compelled to accept him as a compromise. However, he prevented Louis XIV from sending the usual embassy of obedience to Alexander VII, and, while he lived, he foiled the appointment of a French ambassador to Rome, diplomatic affairs being meantime conducted by cardinal protectors, generally personal enemies of the Pope. In 1662, the equally hostile Duc de Crequi was made ambassador. By his abuse of the traditional right of asylum granted to ambassadorial precincts in Rome, he precipitated a quarrel between France and the papacy, which resulted in Alexander VII's temporary loss of Avignon and his forced acceptance of the humiliating treaty of Pisa in 1664.&#91;35&#93;
Alexander ll favored the Spanish in their claims against Portugal, which had reestablished its traditional independence in 1640. His pontificate was also marked by protracted controversies with Portugal.
Alexander VII favoured the Jesuits. When the Venetians called for help in Crete against the Ottoman Turks, the Pope extracted in return a promise that the Jesuits should be permitted back in Venetian territory, from which they had been expelled in 1606. He also continued to take the Jesuit part in their conflict with the Jansenists, whose condemnation he had vigorously supported as advisor to Pope Innocent X. The French Jansenists professed that the propositions condemned in 1653 were not in fact to be found in Augustinus, written by Cornelius Jansen. Alexander VII confirmed that they were too, by the bull Ad Sanctam Beati Petri Sedem (16 October 1656) declaring that five propositions extracted by a group of theologians from the Sorbonne out of Jansen's work, mostly concerning grace and the fallen nature of man, were heretical, including the proposition according to which to say "that Christ died, or shed His blood for all men" would be a semipelagian error. He also sent to France his famous "formulary", that was to be signed by all the clergy as a means of detecting and extirpating Jansenism and which inflamed public opinion, leading to Blaise Pascal's defense of Jansenism.
Alexander VII disliked the business of state, preferring literature and philosophy; a collection of his Latin poems appeared at Paris in 1656 under the title Philomathi Labores Juveniles. He also encouraged architecture, and the general improvement of Rome, where houses were razed to straighten and widen streets and where he had the opportunity to be a great patron for Gian Lorenzo Bernini: the decorations of the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, titular churches for several of the Chigi cardinals, the Scala Regia, the Chair of St. Peter in the Vatican Basilica. In particular, he sponsored Bernini's construction of the beautiful colonnade in the piazza of St. Peter's Basilica.
Alexander VII wrote one of the most authoritative documents related to the heliocentrism issue. He published his Index Librorum Prohibitorum Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus which presented anew the contents of the Index of Forbidden Books which had condemned the works of Copernicus and Galileo. According to Rev. William Roberts, he prefaced this with the bull Speculatores Domus Israel, stating his reasons: "in order that the whole history of each case may be known." 'For this purpose,'  the Pontiff stated, 'we have caused the Tridentine and Clementine Indices to be added to this general Index, and also all the relevant decrees up to the present time, that have been issued since the Index of our predecessor Clement, that nothing profitable to the faithful interested in such matters might seem omitted."&#91;36&#93; Among those included were the previous decrees placing various heliocentric works on the Index ("...which we will should be considered as though it were inserted in these presents, together with all, and singular, the things contained therein...") and using his Apostolic authority he bound the faithful to its contents ("...and approve with Apostolic authority by the tenor of these presents, and: command and enjoin all persons everywhere to yield this Index a constant and complete obedience...")&#91;37&#93;  Thus, Alexander turned definitively against the heliocentric view of the solar system.  After Alexander VII's pontificate, the Index underwent a number of revisions.&#91;38&#93; "In 1758 the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus's De Revolutionibus remained. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index".&#91;39&#93; The Index was abolished entirely in 1966.&#91;40&#93;
Alexander VII's Apostolic Constitution, Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum (8 December 1661),&#91;41&#93; laid out the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in terms almost identical to those utilized by Pope Pius IX when he issued his infallible definition Ineffabilis Deus. Pius X cites Alexander VII's bull in his footnote 11.
Alexander VII died at age 66 from kidney failure. He kept his coffin in his bedroom, and a skull (carved by famed sculptor Bernini) on his writing table, because he was always aware that he would someday die. A seventeenth-century pamphlet credited to Ayres, titled A short Account of the Life and Death of Pope Alexander VII, contains many fascinating details about Alexander's passing. According to this pamphlet, Alexander, although bedridden, wanted to celebrate the Passion to ready himself for his impending death. Neither his surgeon nor his confessor was able to persuade him to save his strength. He blessed the large crowd of people on Easter, the last time they would ever see him alive.&#91;42&#93;
Promoted to the cardinalship eight of those select person, whom he supposed, for their great worth and labours, bestowed for the good of the Papal See, had merited the advancement to so high dignity.
Alexander VII died in 1667 and was memorialised in a spectacular tomb by Bernini.  It is famous for the skeleton holding a gilded hourglass, just above the doors.  He was succeeded by Pope Clement IX (1667–69).
The poet John Flowre wrote a poem about the tomb of Pope Alexander (in 1667).&#91;44&#93;

Saint Francis-Xavier de Montmorency-Laval,  commonly referred to as François de Laval (30 April 1623 – 6 May 1708), was the first Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec, appointed when he was 36 years old by Pope Alexander VII.
Laval was a member of the Montmorency family and was one of the most influential men of his day. He was a candidate for canonization by the Catholic Church after his death and was beatified in 1980 by Pope John Paul II. On 3 April 2014, Pope Francis made him a saint by equipollent canonization.
Laval was born on 30 April 1623 in Montigny-Sur-Avre in the ancient Province of Perche, now the Department of Eure-et-Loir.&#91;1&#93; His father, Hugues de Laval, a member of the House of Laval, was the Seigneur of Montigny, Montbaudry, Alaincourt and Revercourt.&#91;2&#93; His mother, Michelle de Péricard was from a family of hereditary officers of the Crown in Normandy.&#91;2&#93;  Despite his noble descent, his parents were not considered to be wealthy. Montigny was considered equivalent to a good-sized market-town.&#91;3&#93; Laval had five other brothers and two sisters; two of these siblings would also pursue religious paths in life. His youngest brother, Henri, entered the Benedictine Order and his sister, Anne Charlotte, entered the Congregation of Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.&#91;3&#93;
Throughout his life, Laval's mother continuously served as an example of piety and encouraged him to be charitable to those who were less fortunate.&#91;2&#93; Often described as destined for an ecclesiastical lifestyle, Laval was quickly recognized as a clear-sighted and intelligent boy. As a result, he was admitted into the "privileged ranks of those who comprised the Congregation of the Holy Virgin."&#91;4&#93;  This was a society founded by the Jesuits, who aimed to inspire young people to adopt religious lifestyles, and encouraged regular prayer and spiritual practices. At the age of eight, Laval received the tonsure and took minor orders, which then allowed him to enter the College of La Flèche in 1631.&#91;3&#93; This institution was attended by the sons of the elite families in France; hence, Laval was guaranteed a good education. Moreover, it was during this period that Laval came into contact with reports of the Jesuit missions amongst the Huron in Canada, which influenced his desire to become a missionary, like his patron saint, Francis Xavier.&#91;3&#93; In 1637, Laval was appointed a canon of the Cathedral of Évreux by the Bishop of Évreux.&#91;4&#93;
This position proved to be of key importance after the death of Laval's father in September 1636, which left his family in a precarious financial situation.&#91;5&#93; It allowed him to receive revenue from the prebend attached to the position, without which he would have been unable to continue his education.&#91;5&#93; Once he completed his classical education at the age of nineteen, Laval left La Flèche to further pursue his education in philosophy and theology at the College de Clermont in Paris.&#91;3&#93;
Laval's plans were put on hold due to the death of his two eldest brothers; one having fallen at Freiburg and the other at Nordlingen, which effectively made him the head of the family&#91;6&#93; At this point, Laval was faced with the decision of abandoning his ecclesiastical career to take over his father's estate: "bringing him [...] together with a great name, a brilliant future."&#91;6&#93;  In fact, his mother, the Bishop of Évreux, and his cousin all attempted to convince him to leave Paris and return home.&#91;6&#93;  Nonetheless, Laval would not succumb to his family's pressure. Laval helped his mother set the family's affairs in order and arranged for a full renunciation of his rights of primogeniture, which would then be transferred to his brother Jean-Louis.&#91;7&#93;
Once this was complete, Laval returned to Paris where he delved into his studies and began the process of preparing himself to receive holy orders. On 1 May 1647, at the age of twenty four, Laval was ordained a priest.&#91;8&#93; Soon after this, the Bishop of Évreux began to feel remorse for his previous attempt to convince Laval to abandon his ecclesial path; hence, he decided to appoint him as the archdeacon of his diocese in December 1647.&#91;3&#93;  This post required Laval to oversee the affairs of 155 parishes and four chapels. Laval was said to approach this task with fervour and enthusiasm.&#91;3&#93;  In the following years, he devoted himself to establishing order in the parishes, providing relief for the poor, caring for the sick and engaging in different kinds of charitable activities.  This same behaviour would be seen later on in his life, on a completely different continent.
Laval had dreamt of becoming a missionary to travel and preach the Gospel. When he was presented with the possibility of serving as a missionary in Asia, he resigned from his post as archdeacon in 1654.&#91;9&#93; Indeed, the noted Jesuit missionary, Alexandre de Rhodes, was looking for the Pope's permission to appoint candidates as Vicars Apostolic in Tonkin and Indochina.&#91;3&#93;  He was sent to Rome where he remained for fifteen months.&#91;9&#93;  Opposition by the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, which oversaw the missionary work of the Catholic Church, and that of the Portuguese royal court jeopardized the mission which led to the project being discarded in 1654.&#91;3&#93;
Laval was now freed from all responsibility, and thus made the decision to prepare himself "by prayer, for the designs which God might have for him."&#91;9&#93;  He traveled to Caen to stay at a spiritual retreat known as the Hermitage, operated by Jean de Bernières de Louvigny, who, though a layman, was a leader in the reform of the Catholic Church in France.&#91;10&#93; He also made the acquaintance of the founder's nephew, Henri de Bernières, who would later be an invaluable assistant in his work.
Laval remained there for three years, devoting himself to prayer and charitable activity. It is also during this time that he took on the responsibility of reforming a monastery whose morals were thought to be too lax, as well as becoming the administrator of two monasteries of nuns.&#91;3&#93;  His dedication to these projects earned him commendation from François de Servien, the Bishop of Bayeux, who described him as a priest of great piety, prudent and of unusually great competence in business matters, [who had set] fine examples of virtue.&#91;3&#93;  Laval was now well known in the religious community and ready to take the next step in his life.
Laval's nomination as a bishop for New France was the result of increasing tensions regarding the ecclesiastical state of the colony. New France had been left without a bishop for the first 50 years of its settlement. During this time, spiritual matters were often left up to the colony religious officials to regulate, with authority moving from the Recollects to the Jesuits. Only in 1646, due to pressures from Rome, did the Archbishop of Rouen become officially recognized as the immediate authority over the Church in New France.&#91;11&#93; Even with this recognition, the archbishop's authority continued to extend only so far as granting faculties to clergy traveling to the colony.&#91;11&#93; By this time it had already become clear that New France was in need of a more immediate ecclesiastical presence.&#91;12&#93;
Appointing a bishop proved difficult; it was a contentious issue, particularly between the Jesuits and the newly arrived Sulpicians.&#91;12&#93; The Jesuits, who by this time were quite accustomed to working independently, feared being controlled by a Sulpician bishop.&#91;13&#93; Their uneasiness stemmed from beliefs that a Sulpician bishop would undermine their control, and eventually lead to the subordination of the Church to the Crown.&#91;12&#93; While the Sulpicians were busy proposing one of their own, Gabriel Thubières de Levy de Queylus, as bishop, the Jesuits turned their support to Laval. With the assistance of the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria, obtaining royal approval provided little challenge.&#91;14&#93;
What remained an obstacle for the Jesuits and Laval was procuring a papal confirmation.&#91;15&#93; The Holy See remained reserved regarding Laval's nomination. Much of Rome's delay in coming to a decision involved the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.&#91;3&#93; They agreed with the Jesuits that a bishop was needed, however, they feared that Laval as bishop would enable the Jesuits to once again hold a monopoly over the colony. In a compromise between the Jesuits and the Holy See, Laval would be appointed the Apostolic Vicar of New France.&#91;16&#93; Making New France into an apostolic vicariate, rather than a diocese, guaranteed that the head, in this case Laval, answered to the pope rather than the leaders of the Church in France, giving the pope some jurisdiction in the colony.&#91;17&#93; Along with being made vicar apostolic, Laval would be ordained a bishop in partibus, giving him the power he needed to build the Church in Canada.&#91;17&#93;
On 3 June 1658 in Rome, the papal bulls appointing Laval as vicar apostolic were signed. Laval became the Bishop of Petraea in partibus infidelium ("in the lands of the unbelievers").&#91;15&#93; On 8 December 1658, in the church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris, Laval was consecrated the Vicar Apostolic of Quebec by the papal nuncio, Cardinal Celio Piccolomini.&#91;18&#93; Laval took an oath of loyalty to the king and sailed from La Rochelle for New France on 13 April 1659.&#91;3&#93; On 16 June of that year he arrived at Quebec.&#91;3&#93; Immediately upon his arrival Laval began his work; on the same day his ship docked, he baptized a young Huron and gave a dying man his last sacraments.
While small in size, the colony still provided a number of challenges to Laval.&#91;3&#93; He found himself having to make concessions where he never thought to before to a population that, while scarce, was spread out, and was less inclined to continue under strict church discipline.&#91;19&#93; Additionally, he had to deal with the Sulpician Abbé de Queylus, who had already been operating in the colony as Vicar General, under the authority of the Archbishop of Rouen, who continued to claim complete ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the colony. Queylus continued to assert his own authority for nearly two years, during which time Laval repeatedly had to appeal both to the king and to the Holy See for support. In 1674, fifteen years after his arrival to New France, Laval asked that the territory be made into a fully independent diocese. His request was granted, and he was appointed the first Bishop of Quebec.&#91;20&#93;
Laval struggled a great deal throughout his career to defend the church's power against state intrusion. Upon his arrival, Laval was adamant in asserting his primacy over the governor.&#91;20&#93;  He was immediately in opposition with Governor d’Argenson, particularly regarding ceremony and protocol.&#91;20&#93; Also, the issue of selling alcohol to the natives furthered fueled their feud. Laval believed that intoxicated natives were an embarrassment to the colony and endangered the lives of those around them.&#91;21&#93; He quickly imposed the threat of excommunication on those who continued to deal in this trade. Governor D’Argenson abhorred this action, deeming it an intrusion of church into state affairs.&#91;21&#93;  D’Argenson soon resigned and was replaced by d’Avaugour, who, in order to avoid any conflict with Laval, decreed harsh penalties against anyone caught selling alcohol to the natives.&#91;21&#93;  Again, Laval was displeased, believing that excommunication was a far more humane consequence. When alcohol was again being sold freely to natives, in a moment of despair over the state of New France, Laval departed for France in August 1662 to consult with Louis XIV on the matter.&#91;21&#93;  Laval succeeded in bringing about d’Avaugour's recall the following year.&#91;22&#93;
When Laval returned to New France he had increased powers. King Louis XIV had assured Laval that he would have a future appointment as bishop, requested that he establish a Sovereign Council in Quebec, and even asked Laval to choose New France's next governor.&#91;23&#93; For governor, Laval chose Chevalier de Mézy, a friend from his time at the Hermitage of Caen.&#91;23&#93;  In the developing Sovereign Council, which held its first session 18 September 1663, Mézy represented the first figure of authority, followed by Laval, and Gaudais-Dupon, commissioner.&#91;24&#93; Laval appointed Mézy hoping to have an ally among high-ranking state official. In the trade of alcohol to the natives he did find in Mézy an ally; together the two forbade the trading of alcohol.&#91;24&#93;  However, constituting the Sovereign Council revealed that the two represented conflicting interests in matters of church and state. Soon, another conflict between Laval and governor ensued, leading Laval to take to the streets with drums to tell his version of the feud.&#91;25&#93; Upon Mézy's death, the Sovereign council was reorganized. Intendant Jean Talon was added, and immediately assumed the functions previously exercised by Laval.&#91;25&#93;  With this change in the council Laval began to attend the council's meetings less frequently; from then on Laval retreated somewhat from state affairs and focused purely on ecclesiastical matters.&#91;25&#93;
The one issue Laval never relented with, however, was the trade of alcohol to the natives. Once he was appointed bishop, he revisited his original cause. In 1675, Laval, despite Governor Frontenac's resistance on the matter, proceeded to excommunicate all who sold alcohol to the natives.&#91;26&#93;  On 24 May 1679 Laval succeeded in obtaining a royal decree banning the trade.&#91;3&#93;
As bishop, Laval was arguably one of the ultimate sources of authority in New France. However, his dream was not only to expand the Catholic Church in New France, but also to train and teach its future leaders.&#91;27&#93;  On 26 March 1663, the Grand Séminaire was opened in Quebec, and thus the Séminaire de Quebec was born. Its main goal was to train missionary priests and it was affiliated with Laval's own institution, the Séminaire des Missions Étrangères, in Paris.&#91;28&#93; A few years later, in October 1668, Laval also attached a petit séminaire to this institution. It was meant to train boys, amongst whom would be chosen those with vocations to priesthood&#91;27&#93; and natives were welcome.&#91;28&#93; When it opened, only eight French students and six Huron were present, due to a lack of teachers. However, shortly after its opening, a considerable number of French missionaries arrived in the colony, especially Sulpicians, whose commitment was to providing this education.&#91;29&#93; Laval wanted these teachers to spread the word that his institution was to establish a sense of charity and love for religion in the colony and not another source of law or authority.&#91;30&#93;
Laval's view of the Grand Séminaire was greater than a mere teaching academy. He hoped that it would become a home for all parochial priests. Laval encouraged them to see it as their true home and as a place to which they may turn to in sickness or old age.&#91;27&#93;  Furthermore, he wanted the seminary to become a paymaster for all priests and parishes, which meant that it had to be well funded. In order to accomplish this feat, Laval donated most of his own fortune to the seminary since it had now become his home as well.&#91;31&#93; He also convinced the king, Louis XIV, to give him the income of three different abbeys in France. Moreover, since his institution was expected to pay off all priests, Laval thought it would be normal to receive the incomes levied by their parishes. This idea was however met with a lot of resistance from the population, which was not accustomed to contributing to the upkeep of religious institutions. His original goal of demanding a tax worth one-thirteenth of the produce of farms was met with violent resistance, which forced him to reduce it to one-twenty-sixth.&#91;32&#93;
After firmly establishing his seminary, Laval did share a large part of his administrative work with other religious figures, thus slowly developing the church. He appointed his young companion from France, Henri de Bernières, the pastor of Quebec, at the head of the seminary, thus closely linking it with the Parish of Quebec. Furthermore, he also appointed five other directors who would form the bishop's advisory body.&#91;32&#93; In 1668 he appointed the previously troublesome de Queylus as the first Superior of a new seminary in Ville-Marie.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Laval also took interest in practical education for craftsmen and farmers, founding a school of arts and crafts at Saint-Joachim.&#91;32&#93;
Since his arrival in the colony of New France, Laval insisted on establishing and organizing a parochial system, on top of training priests in the colony itself. In 1678, he had obtained an edict from the king stating that permanent curacies will be set up in the colony. A few years later, in 1681, Laval drew up the boundaries of parishes in an attempt to permanently solidify the Church's position. Often visiting each parish, Laval eventually realised that his health was declining and that he could no longer run his large diocese, which extended from Acadia to Lake Michigan. As a result, in 1688, he passed on his responsibilities as a bishop to Jean-Baptiste de La Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier.&#91;33&#93;
Laval continued to collaborate with the colony's high religious authorities, until his very last days. He helped the poor with his presence and his gifts of charity. He never missed a Mass or a day of fasting, despite his ever declining health. By 1707, he had developed an ulcer which eventually took his life on 6 May 1708.&#91;34&#93;  His body was placed in a coffin in the cathedral; however his heart was kept in the chapel of the seminary to which he had dedicated most of his life and fortune.&#91;35&#93;
Laval's remains have been entombed in a shrine for public veneration in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Quebec, which he had founded. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1980. He was granted equipollent canonization on 3 April 2014 by Pope Francis.&#91;36&#93;
Université Laval, founded 1852, was named in his honor. The city of Laval, Quebec, north of Montreal, is also named after him.&#91;37&#93;

An apostolic vicariate is a territorial jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church under a titular bishop centered in missionary regions and countries where dioceses or parishes have not yet been established. It is essentially provisional, though it may last for a century or more. The hope is that the region will generate sufficient numbers of Catholics for the Church to create a diocese. In turn, the status of apostolic vicariate is often a promotion for a former apostolic prefecture, while either may have started out as a mission sui iuris.
It is exempt, directly subject to the missionary Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, not part of an ecclesiastical province, like the stage of apostolic prefecture which often precedes it, and meant to mature until it can be promoted to (usually suffragan) bishopric. 
The Eastern Catholic counterpart is an (apostolic, patriarchal, or archiepiscopal) exarchate.
An apostolic vicariate is led by a vicar apostolic who is usually a titular bishop. While such a territory can be classed as a particular church, according to canon 371.1 of the Latin Code of Canon Law, a vicar apostolic's jurisdiction is an exercise of the jurisdiction of the Pope &#8212; the territory thus comes directly under the pope as "universal bishop", and the pope exercises this authority through a "vicar". This is unlike the jurisdiction of a diocesan bishop, whose jurisdiction derives directly from his office.
Like any ecclesiastical jurisdiction, an apostolic vicariate may be administered by the bishop of a neighbouring diocese, or by a priest appointed transitionally as an apostolic administrator. As in a regular diocese, the vicar apostolic may appoint priests as vicars exercising limited jurisdiction over the apostolic vicariate. Normally, however, an apostolic vicariate is administered by a titular bishop of its own. When someone who does not qualify or has not been ordained as bishop is appointed ad interim, he may be styled Pro-apostolic vicar.
An apostolic vicariate is to be distinguished from an apostolic prefecture, a similar type of territory whose chief distinction from an apostolic vicariate is that its prefect is not a titular bishop, but a mere priest. The latter is not organised enough to be elevated to apostolic vicariate. The less developed instance is the mission sui iuris, which other than the ones mentioned before is not a particular church, although it shares some similarities to one; at its head, an ecclesiastical superior is named. The usual sequence of development is mission, apostolic prefecture, apostolic vicariate and finally diocese (or even archdiocese). See also apostolic exarch for an Eastern Catholic counterpart.
The apostolic vicariate is distinguished from a territorial abbacy (or "abbey nullius") &#8212; an area not a diocese but under the direction of the abbot of a monastery.
Starting in 2019, new Vicars Apostolic, although they are (or become) bishops, are no longer assigned titular sees.

New France (French: Nouvelle-France), also sometimes known as the French North American Empire or Royal New France, was the area colonized by France in America, beginning with the exploration of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in 1534 and ending with the cession of New France to Great Britain and Spain in 1763 under the Treaty of Paris (1763).
The territory of New France consisted of five colonies at its peak in 1712, each with its own administration: Canada, the most developed colony was divided into the districts of Québec, Trois-Rivières, and Montréal; Hudson's Bay; Acadie in the northeast; Plaisance on the island of Newfoundland; and Louisiane.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; It extended from Newfoundland to the Canadian Prairies and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, including all the Great Lakes of North America.
In the 16th century, the lands were used primarily to draw from the wealth of natural resources such as furs through trade with the various indigenous peoples. In the seventeenth century, successful settlements began in Acadia and in Quebec. By 1765, the population of the new Province of Quebec reached approximately 70,000 settlers.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht resulted in France giving Great Britain its claims over mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay, and Newfoundland. France established the colony of Île Royale, now called Cape Breton Island, where they built the Fortress of Louisbourg.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;
The British expelled the Acadians in the Great Upheaval from 1755 to 1764, which has been remembered on July 28 each year since 2003. Their descendants are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada and in Maine and Louisiana, with small populations in Chéticamp, Nova Scotia and the Magdalen Islands. Some also went to France.
In 1763, France ceded the rest of New France to Great Britain and Spain, except the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, at the Treaty of Paris which ended the Seven Years' War, part of which included the French and Indian War in America. Britain received Canada, Acadia, and the parts of French Louisiana which lay east of the Mississippi River, except for the Île d'Orléans, which was granted to Spain with the territory to the west. In 1800, Spain returned its portion of Louisiana to France under the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso, and Napoleon Bonaparte sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, permanently ending French colonial efforts on the American mainland.
New France eventually became absorbed within the United States and Canada, with the only vestige of French rule being the tiny islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. In the United States, the legacy of New France includes numerous placenames as well as small pockets of French-speaking communities.
Around 1523, the Florentine navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano convinced King Francis I to commission an expedition to find a western route to Cathay (China).&#91;7&#93; Late that year, Verrazzano set sail in Dieppe, crossing the Atlantic on a small caravel with 50 men.&#91;8&#93; After exploring the coast of the present-day Carolinas early the following year, he headed north along the coast, eventually anchoring in the Narrows of New York Bay.&#91;8&#93;
The first European to visit the site of present-day New York, Verrazzano named it Nouvelle-Angoulême in honour of the king, the former count of Angoulême.&#91;9&#93; Verrazzano's voyage convinced the king to seek to establish a colony in the newly discovered land. Verrazzano gave the names Francesca and Nova Gallia to that land between New Spain (Mexico) and English Newfoundland.&#91;10&#93;
In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gaspé Peninsula and claimed the land in the name of King Francis I.&#91;11&#93; It was the first province of New France. The first settlement of 400 people, Fort Charlesbourg-Royal (present-day Quebec City), was attempted in 1541 but lasted only two years.&#91;12&#93;
French fishing fleets continued to sail to the Atlantic coast and into the St. Lawrence River, making alliances with Canadian First Nations that became important once France began to occupy the land. French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable fur-bearing animals, especially the beaver, which were becoming rare in Europe. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.
Another early French attempt at settlement in North America took place in 1564 at Fort Caroline, now Jacksonville, Florida. Intended as a haven for Huguenots, Caroline was founded under the leadership of René Goulaine de Laudonnière and Jean Ribault. It was sacked by the Spanish led by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés who then established the settlement of St. Augustine on 20 September 1565.
Acadia and Canada (New France) were inhabited by indigenous nomadic Algonquian peoples and sedentary Iroquoian peoples. These lands were full of unexploited and valuable natural resources, which attracted all of Europe. By the 1580s, French trading companies had been set up, and ships were contracted to bring back furs. Much of what transpired between the indigenous population and their European visitors around that time is not known, for lack of historical records.&#91;11&#93;
Other attempts at establishing permanent settlements were also failures. In 1598, a French trading post was established on Sable Island, off the coast of Acadia, but was unsuccessful. In 1600, a trading post was established at Tadoussac, but only five settlers survived the winter.&#91;11&#93; In 1604, a settlement was founded at Île-Saint-Croix on Baie François (Bay of Fundy), which was moved to Port-Royal in 1605.&#91;11&#93; It was abandoned in 1607, re-established in 1610, and destroyed in 1613, after which settlers moved to other nearby locations, creating settlements that were collectively known as Acadia, and the settlers as Acadians.&#91;11&#93;
In 1608, King Henry IV sponsored Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons and Samuel de Champlain as founders of the city of Quebec with 28 men. This was the second permanent French settlement in the colony of Canada.&#91;13&#93;&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; Colonization was slow and difficult. Many settlers died early because of harsh weather and diseases. In 1630, there were only 103 colonists living in the settlement, but by 1640, the population had reached 355.&#91;16&#93;
Champlain allied himself as soon as possible with the Algonquin and Montagnais peoples in the area, who were at war with the Iroquois. In 1609, Champlain, with two French companions, accompanied his Algonquin, Montagnais, and Huron allies south from the St. Lawrence valley to Lake Champlain. There he participated decisively in a battle against the Iroquois, killing two Iroquois chiefs with the first shot of his arquebus. This military engagement against the Iroquois solidified Champlain's status with New France's Huron and Algonquin allies, enabling him to maintain bonds that were essential to New France's interests in the fur trade.&#91;17&#93;
Champlain also arranged to have young French men live with local indigenous people, to learn their language and customs and help the French adapt to life in North America. These coureurs des bois ("runners of the woods"), such as Étienne Brûlé, extended French influence south and west to the Great Lakes and among the Huron tribes who lived there. For the better part of a century the Iroquois and French clashed in a series of attacks and reprisals.&#91;17&#93;
During the first decades of the colony's existence, the French population numbered only a few hundred, while the English colonies to the south were much more populous and wealthy. Cardinal Richelieu, adviser to Louis XIII, wished to make New France as significant as the English colonies. In 1627, Richelieu founded the Company of One Hundred Associates to invest in New France, promising land parcels to hundreds of new settlers and to turn Canada into an important mercantile and farming colony.&#91;18&#93; Champlain was named Governor of New France and Richelieu forbade non-Roman Catholics from living there. Protestants were required to renounce their faith prior to settling in New France; many therefore chose instead to move to the English colonies.&#91;18&#93;
The Roman Catholic Church, and missionaries such as the Recollets and the Jesuits, became firmly established in the territory. Richelieu also introduced the seigneurial system, a semi-feudal system of farming that remained a characteristic feature of the St. Lawrence valley until the 19th century. While Richelieu's efforts did little to increase the French presence in New France, they did pave the way for the success of later efforts.&#91;18&#93;
At the same time the English colonies to the south began to raid the St. Lawrence valley and, in 1629, Quebec itself was captured and held by the English until 1632.&#91;19&#93; Champlain returned to Canada that year, and requested that Sieur de Laviolette found another trading post at Trois-Rivières, which he did in 1634. Champlain died in 1635.
In 1650, New France had seven hundred colonists and Montreal had only a few dozen settlers. Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. But the severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a Canadian and Huron militia against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when Louis XIV made it a royal province, taking control away from the Company of One Hundred Associates. In the same year the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal ceded its possessions to the Seminaire de Saint-Sulpice.&#91;20&#93; The crown stimulated emigration to New France by paying for transatlantic passages and offering other incentives to those willing to move, and the population of New France grew to three thousand.&#91;21&#93;
In 1665, Louis XIV sent a French garrison, the Carignan-Salières Regiment, to Quebec. The government of the colony was reformed along the lines of the government of France, with the Governor General and Intendant subordinate to the Minister of the Marine in France. In 1665, Jean Talon was sent by Minister of the Marine Jean-Baptiste Colbert to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the Bishop of Quebec, who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.
The 1666 census of New France was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665–66. It showed a population of 3,215 habitants in New France, many more than there had been only a few decades earlier, but also a great difference in the number of men (2,034) and women (1,181).&#91;22&#93;
Talon tried to reform the seigneurial system, forcing the seigneurs to actually reside on their land, and limiting the size of the seigneuries, in an attempt to make more land available to new settlers. These schemes were ultimately unsuccessful. Very few settlers arrived, and the various industries established by Talon did not surpass the importance of the fur trade.
The first settler was brought to Quebec by Champlain ;&#8211;&#32;the apothecary Louis Hébert and his family, of Paris. They came expressly to settle, stay in one place to make the New France settlement function. Waves of recruits came in response to the requests for men with specific skills, like farming, apothecaries, blacksmiths. As couples married, cash incentives to have large families were put in place, and were effective.
To strengthen the colony and make it the centre of France's colonial empire, Louis XIV decided to send single women, aged between 15 and 30 known as the King's Daughters or in French, les filles du roi, to New France, paying for their passage and granting goods or money as a dowry. Approximately 800 arrived during 1663–1673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. By 1672, the population of New France had risen to 6,700, from 3,200 in 1663.&#91;23&#93;
At the same time, marriages with the indigenous peoples were encouraged, and indentured servants, known as engagés, were also sent to New France. The women played a major role in establishing family life, civil society, and enabling rapid demographic growth.&#91;24&#93; There was a high demand for children, for they contributed to the prosperity of the farm from an early age, and there was plenty of food for them. Women bore about 30% more children than comparable women who remained in France. Landry says, "Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time. This was due to the natural abundance of meat, fish, and pure water; the good food conservation conditions during the winter; and an adequate wheat supply in most years."&#91;24&#93;
Besides household duties, some women participated in the fur trade, the major source of cash in New France. They worked at home alongside their husbands or fathers as merchants, clerks and provisioners. Some were widows who took over their husband's roles. A handful were active entrepreneurs in their own right.&#91;25&#93;
After the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, New France began to prosper. Industries such as fishing and farming, which had failed under Talon, began to flourish. A "King's Highway" (Chemin du Roy) was built between Montreal and Quebec to encourage faster trade. The shipping industry also flourished as new ports were built and old ones were upgraded. The number of colonists greatly increased. By 1720, Canada had become a self-sufficient colony with a population of 24,594.&#91;26&#93;
The French extended their territorial claim to the south and to the west of the American colonies late in the 17th century, naming it for King Louis XIV, as La Louisiane. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Ohio River Valley and the Mississippi River Valley, and he claimed the entire territory for France as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.&#91;27&#93; La Salle attempted to establish the first southern colony in the new territory in 1685, but inaccurate maps and navigational issues led him to instead establish his Fort Saint Louis in what is now Texas. The colony was devastated by disease, and the surviving settlers were killed in 1688, in an attack by the area's indigenous population.&#91;28&#93; Other parts of Louisiana were settled and developed with success, such as New Orleans and southern Illinois, leaving a strong French influence in these areas long after the Louisiana Purchase.
Many strategic forts were built there, under the orders of Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac. Forts were also built in the older portions of New France that had not yet been settled.&#91;29&#93; Many of these forts were garrisoned by the Troupes de la Marine, the only regular soldiers in New France between 1683 and 1755.&#91;30&#93;
According to the staples thesis, the economic development of New France was marked by the emergence of successive economies based on staple commodities, each of which dictated the political and cultural settings of the time. During the 16th and early 17th centuries New France's economy was heavily centered on its Atlantic fisheries. This would change in the later half of the 17th and 18th centuries as French settlement penetrated further into the continental interior.&#91;31&#93; Here French economic interests would shift and concentrate itself on the development of the North American fur trade. It would soon become the new staple good that would strengthen and drive New France's economy, in particular that of Montreal, for the next century.
The trading post of Ville-Marie, established on the current island of Montreal, quickly became the economic hub for the French fur trade. It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the St. Lawrence River. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the Company of New France was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of furs from French territories.&#91;33&#93; By trading with various indigenous populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.
The fur trade itself was based on a commodity of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French colony. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the fur trade had on its neighbouring areas of the economy.&#91;34&#93;
Nonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the fur trade, the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.
The founding of the Compagnie des Indes in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.&#91;35&#93; This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices. However, by the middle half of the 18th century the fur trade was in a slow decline.&#91;36&#93;
The natural abundance of furs had passed and it could no longer meet market demand. This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing Montreal and New France altogether; many began trading with either British or Dutch merchants to the south.&#91;36&#93;
By the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.
The coureurs des bois were responsible for starting the flow of trade from Montreal, carrying French goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their furs. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the Ottawa River as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.&#91;37&#93; The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the Iroquois. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.
Montreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of Europe. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.&#91;37&#93;
The issues caused a great rift in the colony, and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The fur trade remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.&#91;37&#93;
As time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called voyageurs.
The French were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.&#91;38&#93;
As the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.
The fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.&#91;39&#93;
Since Henry Hudson had claimed Hudson Bay, and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the Canadian north beyond the French-held territory of New France. In 1670, King Charles II of England issued a charter to Prince Rupert and "the Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson Bay" for an English monopoly in harvesting furs in Rupert's Land, a portion of the land draining into Hudson Bay. This is the start of the Hudson's Bay Company, ironically aided by French coureurs des bois, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers, frustrated with French license rules.&#91;40&#93;&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; Now both France and England were formally in the Canadian fur trade.&#91;43&#93;
The major commercial importance of the Louisiana Purchase territory was the Mississippi River. New Orleans, the largest and most important city in the territory, was the most commercial city in the United States until the Civil War, with most jobs there being related to trade and shipping; there was little manufacturing. The first commercial shipment to come down the Mississippi River was of deer and bear hides in 1705.&#91;44&#93; The area, always loosely defined in those early times of European claims and settlements, extended as far east as the city that is now Mobile, Alabama, begun by French settlers in 1702.
The French (later Spanish) Louisiana Territory was owned by France for a number of years before the money-losing territory was transferred to French banker Antoine Crozat in 1713 for 15 years. After losing four times his investment, Crozat gave up his charter in 1717. Control of Louisiana and its 700 inhabitants was given to the Company of the Indies in 1719. The company conducted a major settlement program by recruiting European settlers to locate in the territory. Unemployed persons, convicts and prostitutes were also sent to the Louisiana Territory. After the bankruptcy of the company in 1720, control was returned to the king.&#91;44&#93;&#91;45&#93;
Louis XV saw little value in Louisiana, and to compensate Spain for its losses in the Seven Years' War, he transferred Louisiana to his cousin Charles III in 1762. Louisiana remained under the control of Spain until it was demanded to be turned over to France by Napoleon. Although Louisiana was property of France by the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800, Louisiana continued to be administered by Spain until the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Following the American acquisition of the territory, its population tripled between 1803 and Louisiana statehood in 1812.
Before the arrival of European colonists and explorers, First Nations followed a wide array of mostly animistic religions.&#91;46&#93; During the colonial period, the French settled along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically  Latin Rite Roman Catholics, including a number of Jesuits dedicated to converting the indigenous population; an effort that eventually proved successful.&#91;47&#93;
The French Catholic Church, which after Champlain's death was the dominant force in New France, wanted to establish a utopian Christian community in the colony.&#91;48&#93; In 1642, they sponsored a group of settlers, led by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, who founded Ville-Marie, precursor to present-day Montreal, farther up the St. Lawrence.&#91;49&#93; Throughout the 1640s, Jesuit missionaries penetrated the Great Lakes region and converted many of the Huron. The missionaries came into conflict with the Iroquois, who frequently attacked Montreal.
The presence of Jesuit missionaries in Huron society was nonnegotiable. The Huron  relied on French goods to facilitate life and warfare. Because the French would refuse trade to all indigenous societies that denied relations with missionaries, the Huron  had more of a propensity towards Christian conversion.&#91;50&#93; The Huron  heavily relied on European goods to perform burial ceremonies known as The Huron Feast of the Dead. Trading with the French allowed for larger amounts of decorative goods to be buried during ceremonies as opposed to only a bare minimum.&#91;50&#93; With the growing epidemics and high number of deaths, the Huron  could not afford to lose relations with the French, fearing to anger their ancestors.&#91;50&#93;
Jesuit missionaries explored the Mississippi River, in the territory of the Illinois. Father Jacques Marquette and explorer Louis Jolliet traveled in a small party, starting from Green Bay down the Wisconsin River to the Mississippi River, communicating with the tribes they met en route. Although Spanish trade goods had reached most of the indigenous peoples, these were the first Frenchmen to connect in the area named for the Illinois, including the Kaskaskia. They kept detailed records of what they saw and the people they met, sketching what they could, and mapped the Mississippi River in 1673.&#91;51&#93; Their travels were described as first contacts with the indigenous peoples, though evidence of contact with Spanish from the south was clear.&#91;51&#93;
Subsequent to the arrival of French children in Quebec in 1634, measles was also brought along with them, which quickly spread among the indigenous peoples .&#91;52&#93; Jesuit priest Jean de Brébeuf described the symptoms as being severe. Brebeuf stated that the fearlessness of the indigenous peoples towards death upon this disease made them perfect candidates for conversion to Christianity.&#91;52&#93; The indigenous peoples believed that if they did not convert to Christianity, they would be exposed to the evil magic of the priests that caused the illness.&#91;50&#93;
Jesuit missionaries were troubled by the absence of patriarchy in indigenous communities. Indigenous  women were highly regarded within their societies and participated in political and military decisions.&#91;53&#93; Jesuits attempted to eliminate the matriarchy and shift the powers of men and women to accommodate those of European societies. "In France, women are to be obedient to their masters, their husbands."&#91;54&#93; Jesuits would attempt to justify this to the indigenous women in hopes to enlighten them on proper European behavior. In response, Indigenous women grew worrisome of the presence of these missionaries fearing they would lose power and freedom within their communities.&#91;54&#93;
By 1649, both the Jesuit mission and the Huron society were almost destroyed by Iroquois invasions (see Canadian Martyrs). In 1653, a peace invitation was extended by the Onondaga Nation, one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. to New France and an expedition of Jesuits, led by Simon Le Moyne, established Sainte Marie de Ganentaa in 1656. The Jesuits were forced to abandon the mission by 1658, as hostilities with the Iroquois resumed.&#91;55&#93;
The second article of the charter of the Compagnie des Cent-Associés stated that New France could only be Roman Catholic.&#91;56&#93; This resulted in Huguenots facing legal restrictions to enter the colony when Cardinal Richelieu transferred the control of the colony to Compagnie des Cent-Associés in 1627. Protestantism was then outlawed in France and all its overseas possessions by the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685.&#91;56&#93; In spite of that, approximately 15,000 Protestants settled in New France by using socioeconomic pretexts while at the same time concealing their religious background.&#91;57&#93;
In the early stage of French settlement, legal matters fell within the Governor of New France's purview.&#91;58&#93; Under this arrangement, legal disputes were settled in an incoherent fashion due to the Governor's arbitrariness in issuing verdicts.
Since 1640, a Seneschal (sénéchal), a Judge (juge d'épée, which literally means 'sword-bearing judge'), and a jurisdiction in Trois-Rivières were created.&#91;58&#93; However, the Seneschal was under the oversight by the Governor, hence the Governor still had rather extensive control over legal matters in New France.&#91;58&#93; In 1651, the Company of New France made the Great Seneschal (Grand Sénéchal) the chief justice.&#91;58&#93; However, the Island of Montreal had its special Governor at that time, who also administered justice on the Island, and had not handed over justice to the Grand Seneschal until 1652.&#91;59&#93;
In practice, though, the Great Seneschal was awarded as an honorary title to the son of Jean de Lauson, then Governor of New France; judicial functions were in fact carried out by the Seneschal's deputies.&#91;60&#93; These deputies included such officials as the civil and criminal lieutenant general (lieutenant général civil et criminel), the special lieutenant (lieutenant particulier, acting as assistant royal judge), and the lieutenant fiscal (lieutenant fiscal, acting as tax magistrate).&#91;60&#93;
The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant General sat as judge in trials at first instance, whereas appeals would be adjudicated by the Governor, who held the sovereign right to settle final appeals on behalf of the French king. The Great Seneschal also had a magistrate in Trois-Rivières, as well as a bailiff formed by the Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice on the Island of Montreal.&#91;61&#93;
Apart from judicial responsibilities, the Great Seneschal was also in charge of convening local nobility in New France, as well as issuing declarations of war if necessary.&#91;59&#93; However, such alternative role of the Great Seneschal was much weakened soon after by having the rights to declare war and to administer finances stripped off from the office because the French crown feared that colonial officers held too much authority.&#91;59&#93;
On 13 October 1663, the royal court replaced the Seneschal Office (sénéchaussée). Canada was divided into three districts: the district of Quebec City, the district of Trois-Rivières, and the district of Montreal.&#91;62&#93; Each district had its own separate jurisdiction with a judge appointed by the Crown, known as the civil and criminal lieutenants general.&#91;62&#93; They were responsible for all legal matters, civil and criminal, in each of the districts.&#91;62&#93;
In addition to the royal judges, there were other judicial officers in each district. The clerk of court (registrar) was responsible for transcribing all court proceedings as well as other documents relevant to each of the cases.&#91;61&#93; The king's attorney (procureur du roi) was responsible for inquiring into the facts and preparing the case against the accused.&#91;63&#93; In the districts of Quebec City and Montreal, the royal judges had special lieutenants to substitute them whenever they were absent or sick.&#91;63&#93; Feudal courts heard minor cases.&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93;
The reform also brought the Sovereign Council of New France (Conseil souverain) into existence, which was later renamed the Superior Council (Conseil supérieur). The Sovereign Council effectively acted as the functional equivalent of a Council of State (Conseil d'État) for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal.&#91;66&#93; Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases.&#91;66&#93; The council's practices evolved over time. At the Sovereign Council there was a king's attorney-general (procureur général du roi) in charge of the similar tasks as the district king's attorneys.&#91;67&#93; He was also responsible for supervising the king's attorneys' daily operations as well as execution of royal edicts and regulations passed by the council in their respective districts.&#91;68&#93;
In 1664, the Custom of Paris (coutume de Paris) was formally set as the main source of law for civil law in France's overseas empire. All royal judges and king's attorneys in New France had to be thoroughly familiar with this compilation of rules.&#91;66&#93; The Custom governed various civil aspects of the daily life in New France, including property, marriage, inheritance, and so on.
The Island of Montreal was a special case because its judiciary had been previously held by the Society of St-Sulpice. In 1663, Governor-General of New France Augustin de Saffray de Mésy originally considered appointing Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve the Governor of the Island of Montreal and consolidating a royal jurisdiction on the island, but the plan garnered the St-Sulpicians' disapproval, who held the Island as its own fiefdom and effectively acted as the island's governor.&#91;69&#93; In other words, the Sovereign Council had not been able to seize effective control over the legal matters of the Island; instead, the St-Sulpicians administered justice on the island.
It was not until 16 September 1666, that the St-Sulpicians finally handed over the justice of the Island of Montreal to the Intendant of New France.&#91;70&#93; In 1693, the French king commanded the replacement of the ecclesiastical courts in Montreal with a royal court composed of one royal judge, with appeals going to the Sovereign Council. The introduction of a royal court on the Montreal Island also resulted in the abolition of the feudal court in the fief of Trois-Rivières (then held by the Jesuits).&#91;71&#93;
In the Quebec City district, the lower court (tribunal antérieur) was established in 1664 and had jurisdiction to try cases at first instance, but then it was abolished in 1674.&#91;72&#93; The Sovereign Council appointed trial judges (juges inférieurs) to adjudicate cases at first instance until the Provostry of Quebec (prévôté de Québec) was created in May 1677.
The Provostry of Quebec was located in the Hall of Justice (palais de justice) in Quebec City and had only one royal judge, also known as the civil and criminal lieutenant general of Quebec City, who heard both civil and criminal cases, as well as district police.&#91;72&#93; Additionally, a court clerk and a king's attorney were appointed to the court; if either of these two officers could not attend the trials due to illness or other untenable circumstances, the Intendant would appoint a temporary substitute.&#91;72&#93;
In the early stages of French colonization, the execution of criminal justice in New France were rather arbitrary. The Governor of New France served as the judge to the colonists as well as soldiers. He would announce his verdict at the presence of the chiefs of the Company of One Hundred Associates and that would be final.&#91;73&#93;
After the Sovereign Council was established in Quebec in 1663, the Council carried out criminal justice according to the general ordinances of France.&#91;73&#93; In 1670, the Criminal Ordinance was enacted in New France by order of the French king as a codification of the previous criminal laws passed by the Sovereign Council.&#91;74&#93;
The ecclesiastical court (tribunal ecclésiastique, or Officialité) was a special court for hearing first instance trials on both religious and secular affairs involving members of the Church.&#91;75&#93; It first appeared in around 1660 but was not officially recognized by state authorities for it was not administered by a bishop, until 1684.&#91;75&#93; Appeals from this court lay with the Sovereign Council.&#91;75&#93;
The court of admiralty was created on 12 January 1717 and was the last judicial body set up in Canada during the French colonial period.&#91;76&#93; The court had a judge (also known as the lieutenant-general of the court) appointed by the French admiralty, a king's attorney, a clerk of court, and one or two bailiffs (huissiers).&#91;77&#93; The admiralty court was located in Quebec City and had jurisdiction over all of New France except Louisiana and Louisbourg.&#91;75&#93; The court heard first instance trials on maritime affairs, including commerce and seamen's conduct.&#91;75&#93; During wartime, it also commanded maritime police.&#91;75&#93; Before 1717, the Quebec Provostry  performed the duties of the admiralty court.&#91;75&#93;
Unlike Canada, Acadia's judicial system was somewhat under-developed during the New France period. Prior to 1670, Acadia was in a state of being torn between various European colonists. None of the countries—France, England, the Netherlands—were able to put in place a stable jurisdiction there.
In 1670, France regained control of Acadia and appointed Mathieu de Goutin as the Civil and Criminal Lieutenant (lieutenant civil et criminel) of Acadia.&#91;78&#93; Simultaneously, the Governor of Acadia was set up and his job was primarily the defense of Acadia from English invasion.&#91;79&#93; The Civil and Criminal Lieutenant was essentially supervised by the Governor, who held superior judicial authority over the Lieutenant, but for most of the time would let the Lieutenant mediate and decide legal affairs.&#91;80&#93;
Due to the situation in Acadia as a small settlement of around 399 settlers in 1670–71, vulnerable to foreign invasion, courts were minimal, consisting of only a Civil and Criminal Lieutenant and a king's attorney.&#91;79&#93; There was not an official court in Acadia, although the king's attorney of Acadia performed very similar duties as his counterpart in New France.&#91;81&#93; Yet since Acadia never actually had a court, there was no clerk of court; instead, trials were recorded by a local notary.&#91;81&#93; It is difficult to trace the judicial history of French Acadia as the relevant archives were destroyed in a fire in 1708.&#91;81&#93;
The presence of settlers, of businesses from several European countries harvesting furs, along with the interests of the indigenous people in this new competition for North American resources set the scene for significant military conflicts among all parties in New France beginning in 1642, and ending with the Seven Years' War, 1756–1763.
Ville-Marie was a noteworthy site for it was the center of defense against the Iroquois, the point of departure for all western and northern journeys, and the meeting point to which the trading Indians brought their annual furs. This placed Ville-Marie, later known as Montreal, at the forefront against the Iroquois, which resulted in its trade being easily and frequently interrupted. The Iroquois were in alliance with the Dutch and English,&#91;82&#93; which allowed them to interrupt the French fur trade and send the furs down the Hudson River to the Dutch and English traders.&#91;37&#93;
This also put the Iroquois at warfare against the Hurons, the Algonquians, and any other tribes that were in alliance with the French. If the Iroquois could destroy New France and its Indian allies, they would be able to trade freely and profitably with the Dutch and English on the Hudson River.&#91;83&#93; The Iroquois formally attacked the settlement at today's Quebec City in its foundation year of 1642, and in almost every subsequent year thereafter.&#91;84&#93; A militant theocracy maintained Montreal. In 1653 and 1654, reinforcements arrived at Montreal, which allowed the Iroquois to be halted.&#91;85&#93;&#91;self-published source&#93; In that year the Iroquois made peace with the French.&#91;37&#93;
Adam Dollard des Ormeaux, a colonist and soldier of New France, was a notable figure regarding the Iroquois attacks against Montreal. The Iroquois soon resumed their assaults against Montreal, and the few settlers of Montreal fell almost completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In the spring of 1660, Adam Dollard des Ormeaux led a small militia consisting of 16 men from Montreal against a much larger Iroquois force at the Battle of Long Sault on the Ottawa River.&#91;86&#93; They succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion and are responsible for saving Montreal from destruction.&#91;87&#93; The encounter between Ormeaux and the Iroquois is of significance because it dissuaded the Iroquois from further attacks against Montreal.&#91;88&#93;
In 1688, King William's War began and the English and Iroquois launched a major assault on New France, after many years of small skirmishes throughout the English and French territories. New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy were able to thwart New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine.&#91;89&#93;&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93; King William's War ended in 1697, but a second war (Queen Anne's War) broke out in 1702. Quebec survived the English invasions of both these wars, and during the wars France seized many of the English Hudson's Bay Company fur trading centres on Hudson Bay including York Factory, which the French renamed Fort Bourbon.
While Acadia survived the English invasion during King William's War, the colony fell during Queen Anne's War. The final Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. In 1713, peace came to New France with the Treaty of Utrecht.&#91;92&#93; Although the treaty turned Hudson Bay, Newfoundland and part of Acadia (peninsular Nova Scotia) over to Great Britain, France remained in control of Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) (which also administered Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island)). The northern part of Acadia, what is today New Brunswick and Maine, remained contested territory. Construction of Fortress Louisbourg on Île Royale, a French military stronghold intended to protect the approaches to the St. Lawrence River settlements, began in 1719.&#91;93&#93;
In Acadia, however, war continued. Father Rale's War (1722–1725) was a series of battles between New England and the Wabanaki Confederacy, who were allied with New France. New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy defended against the expansion of New England settlements into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine.&#91;89&#93;&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93; After the New England Conquest of Acadia in 1710, mainland Nova Scotia was under the control of New England, but both present-day New Brunswick and virtually all of present-day Maine remained contested territory between New England and New France. To secure New France's claim to the region, it established Catholic missions among the three largest indigenous villages in the region: one on the Kennebec River (Norridgewock); one further north on the Penobscot River (Penobscot) and one on the Saint John River (Medoctec).&#91;94&#93;&#91;95&#93;
The war began on two fronts: when New England pushed its way through Maine and when New England established itself at Canso, Nova Scotia. As a result of the war, Maine fell to the New Englanders with the defeat of Father Sébastien Rale at Norridgewock and the subsequent retreat of the indigenous peoples from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers to St. Francis and Becancour, Quebec.&#91;a&#93;
Peace lasted in Canada until 1744, when news of the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession (King George's War in North America) reached Fort Louisbourg. The French forces went on the attack first in a failed attempt to capture Annapolis Royal, the capital of the British Nova Scotia. In 1745, William Shirley, governor of Massachusetts, led a counterattack on Louisbourg. Both France and New France were unable to relieve the siege, and Louisbourg fell to the British. With the famed Duc d'Anville Expedition, France attempted to retake Acadia and the fortress in 1746 but failed. The fortress was returned to France under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, but the peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes.
Within Acadia and Nova Scotia, Father Le Loutre's War (1749–1755) began with the British founding of Halifax. During Father Le Loutre's War, New France established three forts along the border of present-day New Brunswick to protect it from a New England attack from Nova Scotia. The war continued until British victory at Fort Beausejour, which dislodged Father Le Loutre from the region, thereby ending his alliance with the Maliseet, Acadians and Mi'kmaq.&#91;95&#93;
Fort Duquesne, located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, guarded the most important strategic location in the west at the time of the Seven Years' War. It was built to ensure that the Ohio River valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.
In 1755, General Edward Braddock led an expedition against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.&#91;96&#93; Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 Native Americans led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).
The fight for control over Ohio Country led to the French and Indian War, which began as the North American phase of the Seven Years' War (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel George Washington by the French troupes de la marine in the Ohio valley. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the Battle of Fort Beausejour (1755) and then Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) (which also administered Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) with the Siege of Louisbourg (1758).
Throughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The Great Upheaval continued from 1755 to 1764.
These British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.
The following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.
While the British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with Fort Beausejour and Fortress Louisbourg. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the Battle of Beausejour and immediately after began the expulsion of the Acadians.
In the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. Fort de la Corne was built in 1753, by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne just east of the Saskatchewan River Forks in what is today the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.
In 1758, British forces again captured Louisbourg, allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General James Wolfe defeated the French under General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after the attack on Montreal, which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, surrendered to British Major General Jeffery Amherst on 8 September 1760. France formally ceded Canada to the British in the Treaty of Paris, signed 10 February 1763.&#91;97&#93;
The expelled Acadians were initially dispersed across much of eastern North America (including the Thirteen Colonies) and some were sent to France. Many eventually settled in Quebec or Louisiana, while others returned to the regions of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Chéticamp, Nova Scotia and the Magdalen Islands have significant communities. In Louisiana their descendants became known as the Cajuns, a corruption of the French Acadiens.
By the mid 1700s the French settlers were well established with a population around 70,000, mainly due to natural increase.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; The European population had grown slowly under French rule.&#91;98&#93;&#91;99&#93;&#91;100&#93; The British Thirteen Colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast grew in population from natural increase and more new settlers from Europe. By 1760, almost 1.6 ;million people lived in the British colonies, a ratio of approximately twenty-three to one compared to New France.&#91;101&#93; The population of the New England colonies alone in 1760 was nearly 450,000.
French culture and religion remained dominant in most of the former territory of New France until the arrival of British settlers led to the later creation of Upper Canada (today Ontario) and New Brunswick. The Louisiana Territory, under Spanish control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.
Twelve years after the British defeated the French, the American Revolutionary War broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major Clément Gosselin and Admiral Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil. After the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781, the Treaty of Versailles gave all former British claims in New France below the Great Lakes into the possession of the nascent United States. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader Napoleon Bonaparte sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.
The portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as Upper Canada and Lower Canada, 1791–1841, and then those regions were merged as the Province of Canada during 1841–1867, when the passage of the British North America Act of 1867 instituted home rule for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the Dominion of Canada. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the Colony of Nova Scotia but shortly thereafter the Colony of New Brunswick, which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.
In Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring Francophone identity of its descendants, which has led to institutional bilingualism in Canada as a whole.
The only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon (French: Collectivité territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands 25 kilometres (16 ;mi; 13 ;nmi) off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.
The territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: Canada, Hudson's Bay, Acadia, Newfoundland (Plaisance), and Louisiana.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;&#91;102&#93; The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of Île Royale, now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the Fortress of Louisbourg.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; Acadia had a difficult history, with the Great Upheaval, remembered on July 28 each year since 2003. The descendants are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, in Maine and Louisiana in the United States, with small populations in Chéticamp, Nova Scotia and the Magdalen Islands.
In terms of 21st century political divisions and nations, New France included Acadia (eastern Quebec, the coastal territories, and claims to New England as far as Philadelphia, Canada (modern eastern Canada and the Canadian plains in central Canada to the edge of modern-day Alberta), and Louisiana (a vast territory stretching across much of the east half of modern Midwestern United States).
The Conquest (referring to the fall of New France to the British, and specifically the events of 1759-60) has always been a central and contested theme of Canadian memory. Some Anglophone historians portray the Conquest as a victory for "British military, political and economic superiority" and argue that it ultimately brought benefits to the French settlers.&#91;103&#93; However, Cornelius Jaenen notes that French-Canadian historians remain strongly divided on the subject. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule.&#91;103&#93; French-Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Québec's nationalism. Francophone historian Jocelyn Létourneau suggested in 2009, that today, "1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control."&#91;104&#93;
The enduring contestation of the legacy of the Conquest can be exemplified by an episode in 2009, when an attempt to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the battle of the Plains of Abraham was cancelled. The explanation for the cancellation was that it was over security concerns, but activist Sylvain Rocheleau stated, "[I think] they had to cancel the event because it was insulting a majority of Francophones. They had to cancel it because it was a bad idea.".&#91;105&#93;

Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,&#91;a&#93; is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 ;million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.
Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 ;cm (27–28 ;in) in circumference and known as the football. The two teams each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.&#91;5&#93;
Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition.
Football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.&#91;6&#93; The FIFA World Cup has taken place every four years since 1930 with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.&#91;b&#93; It is the most prestigious football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding the Olympic Games.
The most prestigious competition in club football is the UEFA Champions League which attracts an extensive television audience throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.&#91;7&#93; The top five European leagues are the Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), Bundesliga (Germany), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France). Attracting most of the world's best players, each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 ;million/€763 ;million/US$1.185 ;billion.&#91;8&#93;
Football is one of a family of football codes, which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association.

The rules of association football were codified in England by FA in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football. The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in the mid-14th century: "Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe."&#91;9&#93; The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the "rules of the game" were made in 1848, before the "split off in 1863".&#91;10&#93; The term soccer comes from a slang or jocular abbreviation of the word "association", with the suffix "-er" appended to it.&#91;11&#93; The word soccer (which arrived at its final form in 1895) was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.&#91;12&#93;
Within the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called "football" in the United Kingdom and mainly "soccer" in Canada and the United States. People in countries where other codes of football are prevalent (Australia, Ireland, Wales, South Africa and New Zealand) may use either term, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal name.&#91;13&#93;
Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. According to FIFA, the Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball") is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence.&#91;4&#93; Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred.&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.&#91;15&#93;
Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.&#91;17&#93;&#91;18&#93; An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens&#91;14&#93; appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup.&#91;19&#93; Athenaeus, writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football.&#91;15&#93;&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93; As with pre-codified "mob football", the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; Other games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;
Association football in itself does not have a classical history.&#91;19&#93; Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.&#91;29&#93; The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.&#91;30&#93;
The Cambridge Rules, first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857,&#91;31&#93; which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.&#91;32&#93;
These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London.&#91;33&#93; The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.&#91;33&#93; These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.&#91;34&#93;
The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by C.W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of C.W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.&#91;35&#93; The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.&#91;36&#93;
The laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).&#91;37&#93; The board was formed in 1886&#91;38&#93; after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.&#91;39&#93; The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.&#91;40&#93;
Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams,&#91;41&#93; while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet.&#91;42&#93;&#91;43&#93; A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 ;million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football.&#91;44&#93; Football has the highest global television audience in sport.&#91;45&#93;
In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games.&#91;46&#93; The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006&#91;47&#93; and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time.&#91;48&#93; By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras.&#91;49&#93; The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian Independence War of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.&#91;50&#93;
Women may have been playing "football" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game (Tsu Chu) was played by women during the Han Dynasty (25–220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in Han Dynasty (25–220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.&#91;51&#93; There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.&#91;52&#93;
Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93; In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.&#91;55&#93; The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.&#91;55&#93;&#91;56&#93;
The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, "I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most."&#91;57&#93; Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.&#91;58&#93;
Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris, France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22–0.&#91;53&#93;
Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd),&#91;59&#93; women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.&#91;60&#93; Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.&#91;61&#93; This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.&#91;62&#93;
Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93; It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.&#91;64&#93; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women.&#91;64&#93;
The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a "golden age" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches;&#91;65&#93; this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971.&#91;64&#93; The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since,&#91;66&#93; while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996.&#91;67&#93;
Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of 68–70 ;cm (27–28 ;in) circumference,&#91;68&#93; known as the football (or soccer ball). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.&#91;5&#93;
The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, "heading" with the forehead)&#91;69&#93; other than their hands or arms.&#91;70&#93; Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.&#91;71&#93;
During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.&#91;72&#93;
At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.&#91;73&#93; The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,&#91;74&#93; but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.&#91;75&#93; The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.&#91;76&#93;
There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).&#91;77&#93; In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.&#91;74&#93;
The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.&#91;78&#93;&#91;79&#93; Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.&#91;80&#93; Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.&#91;81&#93;
A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three in ninety minutes with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.&#91;82&#93; IFAB recommends "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team". Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.&#91;83&#93;
Goal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent there being controversy. video assistant referees (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.&#91;85&#93;
The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 ;cm (27 and 28 ;in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 ;g (14 to 16 ;oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 standard atmospheres (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch)  at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.&#91;86&#93;&#91;87&#93;
As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.&#91;88&#93;
The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 ;m (110–120 ;yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 ;m (70–80 ;yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 ;m (100–130 ;yd) length and 45–90 ;m (50–100 ;yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 ;m (115 ;yd) long and 68 ;m (74 ;yd) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;&#91;89&#93; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.&#91;90&#93;
The longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.&#91;91&#93; The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32 ;m (24 ;ft) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44 ;m (8 ;ft) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.&#91;92&#93;
In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 ;m (18 ;yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 ;m (18 ;yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.&#91;93&#93;
A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.&#91;94&#93; The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents,&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93; but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while lost time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of "effective playing time".&#91;97&#93; The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.&#91;94&#93; Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90 ;minutes had elapsed and the game was over.&#91;98&#93; The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.&#91;99&#93;
In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays.&#91;100&#93; A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).&#91;5&#93;
In competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.&#91;5&#93;
Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:
A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.&#91;70&#93;
The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.&#91;70&#93;
Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage".&#91;106&#93; The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.&#91;107&#93;
The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.&#91;108&#93; The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.
Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.&#91;109&#93; Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.&#91;c&#93; Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.&#91;109&#93;
Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English Football League deduct 12 points from any team that enters financial administration.&#91;110&#93; Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA. The FIFA headquarters are located in Zürich, Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:&#91;111&#93;
National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the Cameroonian Football Federation in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.&#91;111&#93;
While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.&#91;40&#93;
International competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues. International football, without qualification, most often refers to the former. In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.
The major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since 1930 with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.&#91;d&#93; The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 ;billion with an estimated 715.1 ;million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.&#91;112&#93;&#91;113&#93;&#91;114&#93;&#91;115&#93; The current champions are France, who won their second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia. FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year qualification phase. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champions are the United States, after winning their fourth title in the 2019 tournament.
There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles.&#91;116&#93; Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.&#91;39&#93; As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players. FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and CONCACAF to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since 1992 male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since 1996, players under 23 years old, with three over-23-year-old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.&#91;117&#93;
After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup was contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which was hosting the next World Cup. This was generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The tournament was discontinued following the 2017 edition.
The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.&#91;118&#93;
The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.&#91;120&#93;
The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing), awarding a champion for each.&#91;121&#93; The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a knock-out basis.
Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and most of women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues ;– the Bundesliga (Germany), Premier League (England),&#91;122&#93; La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) ;– attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 ;million/€763 ;million/US$1.185 ;billion.&#91;8&#93;
Clubs first started to pay their players in 1885.
Football hooliganism is disorderly, violent, or destructive behaviour perpetrated by spectators at football events.&#91;123&#93;&#91;124&#93;
Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. five-a-side football) play in non-field environments (i.e. beach soccer, indoor soccer, and futsal) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. paralympic association football).
Casual games can be played with only minimal equipment ;– a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.

Below, the events of World War II have the "WWII" prefix.

Franz Rademacher (20 February 1906 – 17 March 1973) was an official in the Nazi government of the Third Reich during World War II, known for initiating action on the Madagascar Plan.
Rademacher was born on 20 February 1906 in Neustrelitz, Mecklenburg-Strelitz. His father was a railway engineer. He studied law in Rostock&#91;1&#93; and Munich, and entered the profession as a jurist in April 1932.  He held membership in the Sturmabteilung (Nazi stormtroopers) between 1932 and 1934. In 1933, he joined the Nazi Party. He was a vocal anti-semite.
From 1937, he was a diplomat with the German Foreign Office, serving at the German embassy in Montevideo, Uruguay until May 1940. In 1940, he was selected to lead Referat D III, or Judenreferat, of Ribbentrop's Foreign Affairs Ministry.  His direct superior was Nazi diplomat Martin Luther. It was during his tenure in this office, throughout the spring and summer of 1940, that Rademacher initiated the Madagascar Plan, which sought to forcibly deport all of Europe's Jews to the island of Madagascar. He clashed briefly with Adolf Eichmann over organizational control of the plan, which would shortly be abandoned amidst Germany's changing fortunes in World War II.
In October 1941, he was responsible for mass deportations and executions of Serbian Jews. He also had a hand in the deportation of Jews from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. After his visit to Belgrade, Rademacher  filed an expense claim  stating that the official purpose of the trip was to "liquidate the Jews."&#91;2&#93; In 2010, the German Foreign Ministry released an 880-page report on the diplomats of the Third Reich entitled The Ministry and the Past (Das Amt und die Vergangenheit), which mentioned that particular expense claim, bringing  Rademacher a degree of latter-day notoriety.
In 1943, Rademacher became embroiled in Luther's attempted coup to oust Ribbentrop. He was dismissed from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and sent to fight in the navy as an officer for the remainder of the war, ending up with Admiral Doenitz' cypher-breaking unit at Flensburg-Mürwik under the command of Captain Kupfer.&#91;citation needed&#93; Immediately following the war this unit was put at the disposal of Sefton Delmer's news agency in Hamburg. Rademacher was arrested by British military police in November 1945, who ultimately released him. He was eventually brought to trial in Germany in February 1952 for the murders he supervised in Serbia. However, with the aid of Nazi sympathizers, he fled to Syria in September of that year while released on bail. A German court convicted him in absentia for the murder of Serbian Jews, and sentenced him to 3 years and 5 months imprisonment.&#91;citation needed&#93;
In 1962, Israeli spy Eli Cohen delivered a letter bomb to Rademacher in a failed assassination attempt. In 1963, he was arrested in Syria on charges of spying, but was released in 1965 due to ill health. He returned voluntarily to Germany on November 30, 1966, where he was arrested at the Nuremberg airport. Reportedly ill at the time, he was taken to a prison hospital in Bayreuth, while awaiting prosecution in Bamberg.&#91;3&#93; He was again convicted of war crimes and sentenced to five and half years' imprisonment. However, his sentence was never carried out, the court having considered it already served. In 1971, a German high court in Karlsruhe overruled this judgment against Rademacher, and ordered a new trial for his crimes during World War II. He died on 17 March 1973, before proceedings began.&#91;citation needed&#93;

The Madagascar Plan was a proposal by the Nazi German government to forcibly relocate the Jewish population of Europe to the island of Madagascar. Franz Rademacher, head of the Jewish Department of the German Foreign Office, proposed the idea in June 1940, shortly before the Fall of France. The proposal called for the handing over of control of Madagascar, then a French colony, to Germany as part of the eventual peace terms.
The idea of re-settling Polish Jews in Madagascar was investigated by the Polish government in 1937,&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; but the task force sent to evaluate the island's potential determined that only 5,000 to 7,000 families could be accommodated, or even as few as 500 families by some estimates.&#91;a&#93; Because efforts by the Nazis to encourage the emigration of the Jewish population of Germany before World War II were only partially successful, the idea of deporting Jews to Madagascar was revived by the Nazi government in 1940.
Rademacher recommended on 3 June 1940 that Madagascar should be made available as a destination for the Jews of Europe. With Adolf Hitler's approval, Adolf Eichmann released a memorandum on 15 August 1940 calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years, with the island being governed as a police state under the SS. They assumed that many Jews would succumb to its harsh conditions should the plan be implemented.&#91;5&#93; The plan was not viable due to the British naval blockade. It was postponed after the Nazis lost the Battle of Britain in September 1940, and it was permanently shelved in 1942 with the commencement of the Final Solution, the policy of systematic genocide of Jews, towards which it had functioned as an important psychological step.&#91;6&#93;
In the late 1800s and early 1900s there were a number of resettlement plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ("German Writings").&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; Members of the Zionist movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress.&#91;9&#93; Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area.&#91;10&#93; The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others.&#91;11&#93; With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of settling Polish Jews in the island.&#91;2&#93; The head of the commission, Mieczysław Lepecki ;&#91;pl&#93;, felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that, because of the climate and poor infrastructure, only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated.&#91;1&#93;&#91;12&#93;&#91;a&#93;
Racism and antisemitism were basic tenets of the Nazi Party and the Nazi government.&#91;13&#93; Discrimination and violent attacks against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power in 1933.&#91;14&#93; Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazis to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country.&#91;15&#93; By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, and other countries, as well as the British Mandate of Palestine.&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93;
The Nazi leadership seized on the idea of deporting the remaining German Jews overseas. Barren, unproductive lands were viewed as appropriate destinations as this would prevent the deportees from flourishing in their new location.&#91;18&#93; In his May 1940 memorandum to Hitler, Concerning the Treatment of the Alien Population in the East, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler declared that he hoped to see "the term 'Jew' ;[...] completely eliminated through the massive immigration of all Jews to Africa or some other colony".&#91;19&#93;
Initial discussions began to take place in 1938 among Nazi ideologues such as Julius Streicher, Hermann Göring, Alfred Rosenberg, and Joachim von Ribbentrop.&#91;20&#93; Ten percent of Jews under German jurisdiction by that date were Polish nationals. Józef Lipski, the Polish ambassador to Germany, expressed his country's reluctance to take them back, and the Polish government decreed that Polish passport holders would not be permitted to return except under specific conditions.&#91;21&#93; When Ribbentrop raised the matter with French foreign minister Georges Bonnet in December of that year, Bonnet expressed French reluctance to receive more German Jews and inquired if measures could be taken to prevent their arrival. France itself was contemplating how to deport some 10,000 Jews and considered whether Madagascar might be an appropriate destination.&#91;22&#93; Planning for German deportations to Madagascar formally began in 1940.&#91;23&#93; Franz Rademacher, recently appointed head of the Jewish Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarded on 3 June to his superior, the diplomat Martin Luther, a memorandum on the fate of the Jews.&#91;1&#93; Rademacher said: "The desirable solution is: all Jews out of Europe".&#91;19&#93; He briefly considered Palestine as a destination, but deemed it unsuitable, as he considered it undesirable that a strong Jewish state should be created in the Middle East. As well, Palestine was at the time under British control.&#91;24&#93; Rademacher recommended that the French colony of Madagascar should be made available as a destination for the Jews of Europe as one of the terms of the surrender of France, which the Germans had invaded on 10 May 1940.&#91;25&#93; The resettled Jews, noted Rademacher, could be used as hostages to ensure "future good behaviour of their racial comrades in America".&#91;19&#93; The plan was developed by Referat D III of the Abteilung Deutschland.&#91;26&#93;
Luther broached the subject with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was simultaneously developing a similar scheme. By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop spoke of the Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after the defeat of France.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; Once he learned of the plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview.&#91;20&#93; Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA Sub-Department IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for the resettlement of a million Jews per year for four years and abandoning the idea of retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects of the program.&#91;27&#93; While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect of life on the island, which they would govern as a police state.&#91;28&#93;
Most Nazi bureaus, including the Foreign Office, the Security Police, and the Generalgouvernement  pinned their hopes on the plan as the last chance to "solve the Jewish problem" through emigration.&#91;29&#93; In particular, Hans Frank, governor of the General Government (the occupied portion of Poland), viewed the forced resettlement to Madagascar as being preferable to the heretofore piecemeal efforts at deportation into Poland. As of 10 July, deportations into Poland were cancelled and construction of the Warsaw ghetto was halted, since it appeared to be unnecessary.&#91;20&#93;
Rademacher envisioned the founding of a European bank that would ultimately liquidate all European Jewish assets to pay for the plan. This bank would then play an intermediary role between Madagascar and the rest of the world, as Jews would not be allowed to interact financially with outsiders. Göring's office of the Four Year Plan would oversee the administration of the plan's economics.&#91;30&#93;
Additionally, Rademacher foresaw roles for other government agencies. Ribbentrop's Foreign Affairs Ministry would negotiate terms with the French for the handover of Madagascar to Germany. It would also play a part in crafting other treaties to deal with Europe's Jews. Its Information Department, along with Joseph Goebbels and his Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, would control the flow of information at home and abroad. Viktor Brack, a division chief in the Chancellery of the Führer, would oversee transportation. The SS would undertake the expulsion of the Jews from Europe and govern the island as a police state.&#91;31&#93; The Nazis expected that after the invasion of the United Kingdom in Operation Sea Lion that they would commandeer the British merchant fleet to transport the Jews to Madagascar.&#91;30&#93; The Nazis expected many deportees to perish in the harsh conditions or die at the hands of the SS.&#91;32&#93; The plan has been characterised by the historian Ian Kershaw as genocide by an alternative method.&#91;33&#93;
With the failure to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the proposed invasion of the UK was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940. This meant the British merchant fleet would not be at Germany's disposal for use in evacuations, and planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled.&#91;30&#93; In late August 1940, Rademacher entreated Ribbentrop to hold a meeting at his ministry to begin drawing up a panel of experts to consolidate the plan. Ribbentrop never responded. Likewise, Eichmann's memorandum languished with Heydrich, who never approved it.&#91;30&#93; Establishment of ghettos in Warsaw and other cities in Poland resumed in August 1940.&#91;34&#93; The plan was officially shelved within the Foreign Office in February 1942.&#91;35&#93; British forces took the island from Vichy France in the Battle of Madagascar in November 1942 and control was transferred to the Free French.
Once planning for Operation Barbarossa commenced, Hitler asked Himmler to draft a new plan for the elimination of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland.&#91;36&#93; The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. The plan hinged on the rapid defeat of the Soviet forces. &#91;37&#93; Once it became apparent that the war against the Soviet Union would drag on much longer than expected, Heydrich revised his plans to concentrate on the Jewish population then under Nazi control. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich  decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland.&#91;38&#93; The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 ;million people.&#91;39&#93;

Madagascar (/ˌmædəˈɡæskər, -kɑːr/; Malagasy: Madagasikara), officially the Republic of Madagascar (Malagasy: Repoblikan'i Madagasikara Malagasy pronunciation: ;[republiˈkʲan madaɡasˈkʲarə̥]; French: République de Madagascar), and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, approximately 400 kilometres (250 miles) off the coast of East Africa. At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 ;sq ;mi) Madagascar is the world's second-largest island country.&#91;12&#93; The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian subcontinent around 88 ;million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.
The archaeological evidence of the earliest human foraging on Madagascar may date up to 10,000 years ago.&#91;13&#93; Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 ;BC and 550 AD by Indianized Austronesian peoples, arriving on outrigger canoes from Indonesia. The social and religious situation of Indonesia during those times were that of Hinduism and Buddhism, along with native Indonesian culture. These were joined around the 9th century AD by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more subgroups, of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands.
Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a popular uprising in 2009, president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when Hery Rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar is a member of the United Nations, the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.
Madagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries, according to the United Nations.&#91;14&#93; Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs, Christianity, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. As of 2017&#91;update&#93;, the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population.
In the Malagasy language, the island of Madagascar is called Madagasikara (Malagasy pronunciation: ;[madaɡasʲˈkʲarə̥]) and its people are referred to as Malagasy.&#91;15&#93; The island's appellation "Madagascar" is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the Middle Ages by Europeans.&#91;16&#93; The name Madageiscar was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo as a corrupted transliteration of the name Mogadishu, the Somali port with which Polo had confused the island.&#91;17&#93;
On St. Laurence's Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer Diogo Dias landed on the island and named it São Lourenço. Polo's name was preferred and popularized on Renaissance maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating Madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.&#91;17&#93;
At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 ;sq ;mi),&#91;18&#93; Madagascar is the world's 47th largest country,&#91;19&#93; the 2nd largest island country&#91;12&#93; and the fourth-largest island.&#91;18&#93; The country lies mostly between latitudes 12°S and 26°S, and longitudes 43°E and 51°E.&#91;20&#93; Neighboring islands include the French territory of Réunion and the country of Mauritius to the east, as well as the state of Comoros and the French territory of Mayotte to the north west. The nearest mainland state is Mozambique, located to the west.
The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana separated the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135 ;million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88 ;million years ago during the late Cretaceous period allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation.&#91;21&#93; Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.
To the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1,500 ;m (2,460 to 4,920 ;ft) above sea level. These central highlands, traditionally the homeland of the Merina people and the location of their historic capital at Antananarivo, are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced, rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the subhumid forests that formerly covered the highland region. To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the Mozambique Channel and mangrove swamps along the coast.&#91;22&#93;
Madagascar's highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs: Maromokotro 2,876 ;m (9,436 ;ft) in the Tsaratanana Massif is the island's highest point, followed by Boby Peak 2,658 ;m (8,720 ;ft) in the Andringitra Massif, and Tsiafajavona 2,643 ;m (8,671 ;ft) in the Ankaratra Massif. To the east, the Canal des Pangalanes is a chain of man-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some 600 ;km (370 ;mi).&#91;23&#93;
The western and southern sides, which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.&#91;23&#93;
The combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rainforest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.&#91;22&#93;
Tropical cyclones cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.&#91;24&#93; In 2004, Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless&#91;25&#93; and caused more than US$250 ;million in damage.&#91;26&#93;
As a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents, Madagascar is home to various plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; Approximately 90% of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are endemic.&#91;29&#93; This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the "eighth continent",&#91;30&#93; and the island has been classified by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot.&#91;27&#93;
More than 80 ;percent of Madagascar's 14,883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world, including five plant families.&#91;31&#93; The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar.&#91;22&#93; Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island.&#91;32&#93; Three-fourths&#91;33&#93; of Madagascar's 860&#91;31&#93; orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species.&#91;34&#93; The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic.&#91;33&#93; Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine&#91;35&#93;&#91;36&#93; and vincristine&#91;35&#93;&#91;37&#93; are vinca alkaloids,&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93; used to treat Hodgkin's disease,&#91;40&#93; leukemia,&#91;41&#93; and other cancers,&#91;42&#93; were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle.&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93; The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala&#91;45&#93; and endemic to the eastern rain forests,&#91;46&#93; is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.&#91;47&#93;
Like its flora, Madagascar's fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism. Lemurs have been characterized as "Madagascar's flagship mammal species" by Conservation International.&#91;27&#93; In the absence of monkeys and other competitors, these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species. As of 2012&#91;update&#93;, there were officially 103 species and subspecies of lemur,&#91;49&#93; 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008.&#91;50&#93; They are almost all classified as rare, vulnerable, or endangered. At least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since humans arrived on Madagascar, all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species.&#91;51&#93;
A number of other mammals, including the cat-like fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60 ;percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic.&#91;27&#93; The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90 ;percent of these being endemic&#91;52&#93; (including one endemic family).&#91;27&#93; The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species,&#91;52&#93; including the smallest known,&#91;53&#93; and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons.
Endemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied on Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species. All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic, as are a majority of the island's butterflies, scarab beetles, lacewings, spiders and dragonflies.&#91;27&#93;
Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity.&#91;54&#93; Since the arrival of humans around 2,350 ;years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90 ;percent of its original forest.&#91;55&#93; This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers.&#91;56&#93; Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice not only for its practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy).&#91;57&#93; As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1,400 years ago.&#91;58&#93; By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests.&#91;56&#93; More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1,000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century.&#91;59&#93;
According to a conservative estimate, about 40 ;percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80 ;percent.&#91;60&#93; In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.&#91;61&#93;
Invasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations. Following the 2014 discovery in Madagascar of the Asian common toad, a relative of a toad species that has severely harmed wildlife in Australia since the 1930s, researchers warned the toad could "wreak havoc on the country's unique fauna."&#91;62&#93; Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar's endemic species or driven them to extinction. The island's elephant birds, a family of endemic giant ratites, became extinct in the 17th century or earlier, most probably because of human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food.&#91;63&#93; Numerous giant lemur species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island, while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food.&#91;64&#93; A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island's wildlife: 90 ;percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. By contrast, a previous study in 2008 had found only 38 ;percent of lemur species were at risk of extinction.&#91;49&#93;
In 2003, Ravalomanana announced the Durban Vision, an initiative to more than triple the island's protected natural areas to over 60,000 ;km2 (23,000 ;sq ;mi) or 10 ;percent of Madagascar's land surface. As of 2011&#91;update&#93;, areas protected by the state included five Strict Nature Reserves (Réserves Naturelles Intégrales), 21 Wildlife Reserves (Réserves Spéciales) and 21 National Parks (Parcs Nationaux).&#91;65&#93; In 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint World Heritage Site under the name Rainforests of the Atsinanana. These parks are Marojejy, Masoala, Ranomafana, Zahamena, Andohahela and Andringitra.&#91;66&#93; Local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests within Marojejy National Park and exporting the wood to China for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments.&#91;67&#93; To raise public awareness of Madagascar's environmental challenges, the Wildlife Conservation Society opened an exhibit entitled "Madagascar!" in June 2008 at the Bronx Zoo in New York.&#91;68&#93;
Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 ;BC.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93; Early Holocene humans might have existed on the island 10,500 years ago, based on grooves found on elephant bird bones left by humans.&#91;71&#93; However, a counterstudy concluded that human-made marks date to 1,200 years ago at the earliest, in which the previously mentioned bone damage may have been made by scavengers, ground movements or cuts from the excavation process.&#91;72&#93;
Madagascar late colonization by human settlers arriving in outrigger canoes from the Sunda islands and Malay Archipelago (Sumatra, Banjar and Bugis).&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93;&#91;75&#93;&#91;76&#93; between 200 BCE and 500 CE, colonized by Srivijaya Empire (now Indonesia),&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93;&#91;79&#93; according to an extensive new mitochondrial DNA study, native Malagasy people today can likely trace their genetic heritage back to 30 different mothers from Indonesia.&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93;&#91;83&#93; In either case, these dates make Madagascar the last major landmass on Earth to be settled by humans, except for Iceland and New Zealand.&#91;84&#93;
Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.&#91;85&#93; By 600 ;AD, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.&#91;86&#93; Arab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries.&#91;87&#93; A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000 ;AD. South Indian Tamil merchants arrived around 11th century. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds.&#91;56&#93; Irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later.&#91;86&#93; The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century.&#91;56&#93; The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1,000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries.&#91;88&#93; Today, the spirits of the Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.&#91;89&#93;
Madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement.
The written history of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe), Arab astrology, and other cultural elements.&#91;24&#93;
European contact began in 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island, while participating in the 2nd Armada of the Portuguese India Armadas.&#91;18&#93; The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.&#91;24&#93; Brazil was also first encountered by Europeans on the same voyage of the 2nd Armada, which was commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral.
From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The small island of Nosy Boroha off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of Libertalia.&#91;90&#93; Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.&#91;91&#93;
The wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.&#91;92&#93; Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of Menabe and Boina on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.&#91;93&#93;
Upon its emergence in the early 17th century, the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms&#91;93&#93; and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when King Andriamasinavalona divided it among his four sons. Following almost a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810).&#91;94&#93; From his initial capital Ambohimanga,&#91;95&#93; and later from the Rova of Antananarivo, this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King Radama I (1810–28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of Mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the London Missionary Society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as James Cameron, David Jones and David Griffiths, who established schools, transcribed the Malagasy language using the Roman alphabet, translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.&#91;96&#93;
Radama's successor, Queen Ranavalona I (1828–61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. William Ellis (missionary) described his visits made during her reign in his book Three Visits to Madagascar during the years 1853, 1854 and 1856. She made heavy use of the traditional practice of fanompoana (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the Kingdom of Merina to encompass most of Madagascar. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the tangena ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population.&#91;97&#93; The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign, the population of Madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 ;million to 2.5 ;million between 1833 and 1839.&#91;98&#93;
Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were Jean Laborde, an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and Joseph-François Lambert, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince Radama II signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861–63) attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was overthrown two years later by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony (1852–1865) and an alliance of Andriana (noble) and Hova (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.&#91;24&#93;
Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen, Rasoherina (1863–68), the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister: a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them.&#91;99&#93; Queen Rasoherina accepted, first marrying Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and marrying his brother, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony (1864–95), who would go on to marry Queen Ranavalona II (1868–83) and Queen Ranavalona III (1883–97) in succession.&#91;100&#93; Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government.&#91;101&#93; Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers.&#91;102&#93; Polygamy was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace.&#91;101&#93; Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British common law and three European-style courts were established in the capital city.&#91;102&#93; In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.&#91;102&#93;
Primarily on the basis that the Lambert Charter had not been respected, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco-Hova War.&#91;103&#93; At the end of the war, Madagascar ceded the northern port town of Antsiranana (Diego Suarez) to France and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert's heirs.&#91;104&#93; In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French protectorate on the island, but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar. To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of Toamasina on the east coast, and Mahajanga on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.&#91;105&#93;
A French military flying column then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from Algeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender.&#91;106&#93; France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria. A two-year resistance movement organized in response to the French capture of the royal palace was effectively put down at the end of 1897.&#91;107&#93;
Under colonial rule, plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops.&#91;108&#93; Slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants&#91;109&#93; or as sharecroppers; in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today.&#91;110&#93; Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo&#91;111&#93; and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum.&#91;112&#93; Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on French language and practical skills.&#91;113&#93;
The Merina royal tradition of taxes paid in the form of labor was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo.&#91;114&#93; Malagasy troops fought for France in World War I.&#91;18&#93; In the 1930s, Nazi political thinkers developed the Madagascar Plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews.&#91;115&#93; During the Second World War, the island was the site of the Battle of Madagascar between the Vichy government and the British.&#91;116&#93;
The occupation of France during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the Malagasy Uprising of 1947.&#91;117&#93; This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence.&#91;118&#93; The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.&#91;119&#93;
Since regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The First Republic (1960–72), under the leadership of French-appointed President Philibert Tsiranana, was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this "neo-colonial" arrangement inspired a series of farmer and student protests that overturned his administration in 1972.&#91;24&#93;
Gabriel Ramanantsoa, a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General Gilles Andriamahazo ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, who ushered in the socialist-Marxist Second Republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.
This period saw a political alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,&#91;24&#93; and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.&#91;120&#93;
Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of Albert Zafy (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the Third Republic (1992–2010).&#91;121&#93; The new Madagascar constitution established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade.&#91;24&#93; Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, Norbert Ratsirahonana, was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.&#91;120&#93;
The contested 2001 presidential elections in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7 ;percent per year under his administration. In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.&#91;120&#93;
Opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a movement in early 2009 in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a coup d'état. In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the High Transitional Authority, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was adopted by referendum, establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.&#91;121&#93; Hery Rajaonarimampianina was declared the winner of the 2013 presidential election, which the international community deemed fair and transparent.&#91;122&#93;
Madagascar is a semi-presidential representative democratic multi-party republic, wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.&#91;18&#93;
The public directly elects the president and the 127 members of the National Assembly to five-year terms. All 33 members of the Senate serve six-year terms, with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president. The last National Assembly election was held on 20 December 2013&#91;18&#93; and the last Senate election was held on 30 December 2015.&#91;123&#93;
At the local level, the island's 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further subdivided into regions and communes. The judiciary is modeled on the French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance.&#91;124&#93; The courts, which adhere to civil law, lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.&#91;125&#93;
Antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of Madagascar.&#91;18&#93; It is located in the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga.&#91;88&#93; As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.&#91;126&#93; The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).&#91;18&#93;
Since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental effects on the local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.&#91;127&#93; A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed.&#91;128&#93; Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.&#91;129&#93;
Madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina.&#91;130&#93; Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military.&#91;18&#93; Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India,&#91;131&#93; while Madagascar has embassies in sixteen other countries.
Human rights in Madagascar are protected under the constitution and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.&#91;132&#93; Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations.&#91;61&#93;&#91;132&#93; Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.&#91;61&#93; Accusations of media censorship have risen due to the alleged restrictions on the coverage of government opposition.&#91;133&#93; Some journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news.&#91;134&#93;
The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms.&#91;135&#93; By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000.&#91;136&#93; French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy's army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.&#91;137&#93;
The political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960.&#91;138&#93; Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991.&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93; The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of the Interior&#91;124&#93; and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.&#91;61&#93;
The Minister of the Interior is responsible for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police.&#91;124&#93; The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps.&#91;141&#93; Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island.&#91;61&#93; Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.&#91;124&#93; Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.&#91;61&#93;
Madagascar is subdivided into 22 regions (faritra).&#91;18&#93; The regions are further subdivided into 119 districts, 1,579 communes, and 17,485 fokontany.&#91;141&#93;
Agriculture has long influenced settlement on the island. Only 15% of the nation's 24,894,551 population live in the 10 largest cities.

Madagascar became a Member State of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its independence on 26 June 1960.&#91;145&#93; As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti as part of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti.&#91;146&#93; Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar.&#91;147&#93; These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both the quantity and quality of their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.&#91;147&#93; In 2017, Madagascar signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.&#91;148&#93;
During the era of Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily influenced Madagascar's economic planning and policy and served as its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75 ;percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50 ;percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.&#91;23&#93;
The IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account in 2005.&#91;18&#93;
Madagascar's GDP in 2015 was estimated at US$9.98 ;billion, with a per capita GDP of $411.82.&#91;149&#93;&#91;150&#93; Approximately 69 ;percent of the population lives below the national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day.&#91;151&#93; During 2011–15, the average growth rate was 2.6% but was expected to have reached 4.1% in 2016, due to public works programs and a growth of the service sector.&#91;152&#93; The agriculture sector constituted 29 ;percent of Malagasy GDP in 2011, while manufacturing formed 15 ;percent of GDP. Madagascar's other sources of growth are tourism, agriculture and the extractive industries.&#91;153&#93; Tourism focuses on the niche eco-tourism market, capitalizing on Madagascar's unique biodiversity, unspoiled natural habitats, national parks and lemur species.&#91;154&#93; An estimated 365,000 tourists visited Madagascar in 2008, but the sector declined during the political crisis with 180,000 tourists visiting in 2010.&#91;153&#93; However, the sector has been growing steadily for a few years; In 2016, 293,000 tourists landed in the African island with an increase of 20% compared to 2015; For 2017 the country has the goal of reaching 366,000 visitors, while for 2018 government estimates are expected to reach 500,000 annual tourists.&#91;155&#93;
The island is still a very poor country in 2018; structural brakes remain in the development of the economy: corruption and the shackles of the public administration, lack of legal certainty, and backwardness of land legislation. The economy, however, has been growing since 2011, with GDP growth exceeding 4% per year;&#91;156&#93;&#91;157&#93; almost all economic indicators are growing, the GDP per capita was around $1600 (PPP) for 2017,&#91;158&#93; one of the lowest in the world, although growing since 2012; unemployment was also cut, which in 2016 was equal to 2.1%&#91;159&#93; with a work force of 13.4 ;million as of 2017.&#91;160&#93; The main economic resources of Madagascar are tourism, textiles, agriculture, and mining.
Madagascar's natural resources include a variety of agricultural and mineral products. Agriculture (including the growing of raffia), mining, fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. In 2017 the top exports of Madagascar were vanilla (US$894M), nickel metal (US$414M), cloves (US$288M), knitted sweaters (US$184M) and cobalt (US$143M).&#91;162&#93;
Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves&#91;163&#93; and ylang-ylang.&#91;25&#93; Madagascar supplies 80% of the world's natural vanilla.&#91;164&#93; Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.&#91;165&#93;
Madagascar has one of the world's largest reserves of ilmenite (titanium ore), as well as important reserves of chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel.&#91;23&#93; Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near Tôlanaro by Rio Tinto,&#91;166&#93; extraction of nickel near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International,&#91;167&#93; and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.&#91;168&#93;
Exports formed 28 ;percent of GDP in 2009.&#91;18&#93; Most of the country's export revenue is derived from the textiles industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs.&#91;153&#93; France is Madagascar's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties to the country.&#91;23&#93; The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets.&#91;169&#93; Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52 ;percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar's imports include China,&#91;170&#93; France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.&#91;18&#93;
In 2010, Madagascar had approximately 7,617 ;km (4,730 ;mi) of paved roads, 854 ;km (530 ;mi) of railways and 432 ;km (270 ;mi) of navigable waterways.&#91;11&#93; The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved, with many becoming impassable in the rainy season. Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo, with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district.&#91;24&#93;
There are several rail lines. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.&#91;24&#93; The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.&#91;166&#93; Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.&#91;24&#93;
Running water and electricity are supplied at the national level by a government service provider, Jirama, which is unable to service the entire population. As of 2009&#91;update&#93;, only 6.8 ;percent of Madagascar's fokontany had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5 ;percent had access to its electricity services.&#91;141&#93; Fifty-six percent of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants, with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators.&#91;171&#93; Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30% of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.&#91;141&#93;
Radio broadcasts remain the principal means by which the Malagasy population access international, national, and local news. Only state radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island. Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting.&#91;125&#93; In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar. Several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves, including the media groups MBS (owned by Ravalomanana) and Viva (owned by Rajoelina),&#91;61&#93; contributing to political polarization in reporting.
The media have historically come under varying degrees of pressure to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed, and media outlets are periodically forced to close.&#91;125&#93; Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 because of the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism.&#91;132&#93; Access to the internet has grown dramatically over the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or in one of the nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.&#91;125&#93;
Medical centers, dispensaries and hospitals are found throughout the island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers.&#91;172&#93; In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010, Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000 people and a total of 3,150 doctors, 5,661 nurses, 385 community health workers, 175 pharmacists, and 57 dentists for a population of 22 ;million. Fifteen percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70 percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30 percent originated with international donors and other private sources.&#91;173&#93; The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.&#91;141&#93;
Despite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria, and measles increased an average of 60 percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6 children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8 percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth.&#91;173&#93; In 2010, the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births,&#91;18&#93; with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births.&#91;174&#93; Schistosomiasis, malaria, and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at 0.2 percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000 people, in part because of the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa.&#91;173&#93; Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67 years for women.&#91;173&#93;
Madagascar had outbreaks of the bubonic plague and pneumonic plague in 2017 (2575 cases, 221 deaths) and 2014 (263 confirmed cases, 71 deaths).&#91;175&#93; In 2019, Madagascar had a measles outbreak, resulting in 118,000 cases and 1,688 deaths. In 2020, Madagascar was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Prior to the 19th century, all education in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders.&#91;24&#93; The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835&#91;176&#93; but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.
By the end of the 19th century, Madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.&#91;24&#93; Consequently, under the socialist Second Republic, French instructors and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared the language of instruction, and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.&#91;177&#93;
This policy, known as malgachization, coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.&#91;178&#93;
Education was prioritized under the Ravalomanana administration (2002–09), and is currently free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13.&#91;179&#93; The primary schooling cycle is five years, followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level.&#91;24&#93; During Ravalomanana's first term, thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated, and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated, and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.&#91;179&#93;
Government school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per fokontany and one lower secondary school within each commune. At least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers.&#91;141&#93; The three branches of the national public university are located at Antananarivo, Mahajanga, and Fianarantsoa. These are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges.&#91;24&#93;
As a result of increased educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout.&#91;179&#93; Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom.&#91;180&#93; Public expenditure on education was 2.8 ;percent of GDP in 2014. The literacy rate is estimated at 64.7%.&#91;19&#93;
In 2018, the population of Madagascar was estimated at 26 ;million, up from 2.2 ;million in 1900.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;24&#93; The annual population growth rate in Madagascar was approximately 2.9 ;percent in 2009.&#91;18&#93;
Approximately 42.5 ;percent of the population is younger than 15 years of age, while 54.5 ;percent are between the ages of 15 and 64. Those aged 65 and older form 3 percent of the total population.&#91;153&#93; Only two general censuses, in 1975 and 1993, have been carried out after independence. The most densely populated regions of the island are the eastern highlands and the eastern coast, contrasting most dramatically with the sparsely populated western plains.&#91;24&#93;
The Malagasy ethnic group forms over 90 ;percent of Madagascar's population and is typically divided into 18 ethnic subgroups.&#91;18&#93; Recent DNA research revealed that the genetic makeup of the average Malagasy person constitutes an approximately equal blend of Southeast Asian and East African genes,&#91;181&#93;&#91;182&#93; although the genetics of some communities show a predominance of Southeast Asian or East African origins or some Arab, Indian, or European ancestry.&#91;183&#93;
Southeast Asian features – specifically from the southern part of Borneo – are most predominant among the Merina of the central highlands,&#91;129&#93; who form the largest Malagasy ethnic subgroup at approximately 26 ;percent of the population, while certain communities among the coastal peoples (collectively called côtiers) have relatively stronger East African features. The largest coastal ethnic subgroups are the Betsimisaraka (14.9 ;percent) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (6 ;percent each).&#91;24&#93;
Chinese, Indian and Comoran minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.&#91;24&#93; By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.&#91;23&#93; The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958&#91;118&#93; to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000 ;Comorans, 18,000 ;Indians, and 9,000 ;Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.&#91;24&#93;
The Malagasy language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,&#91;184&#93; can be clustered under one of two subgroups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo, and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a francophone country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.&#91;24&#93;
No official languages were mentioned in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.&#91;185&#93;
In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English.&#91;186&#93; English was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the November 2010 referendum.&#91;1&#93; The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition, who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the way the election was organized by the High Transitional Authority.&#91;121&#93;
Religion in Madagascar (2010) according to the Pew Research Center&#91;187&#93;
According to the U.S. Department of State in 2011, 41% of Madagascans practiced Christianity, and 52% adhered to traditional religions,&#91;18&#93; which tends to emphasize links between the living and the razana (ancestors); these numbers were drawn from the 1993 census. According to the Pew Research Center in 2010, 85% of the population now practiced Christianity, while just 4.5% of Madagascans practiced folk religions; among Christians, practitioners of Protestantism outnumbered adherents of Roman Catholicism.&#91;187&#93;
The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana, whereby a deceased family member's remains are exhumed and re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds, before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served, and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.&#91;188&#93; Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.&#91;189&#93;
Today, many Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a Christian minister to consecrate a famadihana reburial.&#91;188&#93; The Malagasy Council of Churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations of Madagascar (Roman Catholic, Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, Lutheran, and Anglican) and has been an influential force in Malagasy politics.&#91;190&#93;
Islam is also practiced on the island. Islam was first brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion took hold in only a handful of southeastern coastal communities. Today, Muslims constitute 3–7 ;percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorans.
More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home.&#91;191&#93;
Each of the many ethnic subgroups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.&#91;24&#93;&#91;189&#93;
Although social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity, and roles within the community.&#91;192&#93; Malagasy people traditionally consult Mpanandro ("Makers of the Days") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or famadihana, according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ombiasy (from olona-be-hasina, "man of much virtue") of the southeastern Antemoro ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.&#91;193&#93;
The diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, and is very similar in form to those found in Indonesia and the Philippines today.&#91;194&#93; Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.&#91;195&#93; Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.&#91;196&#93; The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven lamba, has evolved into a varied and refined art.&#91;197&#93;
The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.&#91;198&#93; African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.&#91;86&#93;
A wide variety of oral and written literature has developed in Madagascar. One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its oratory, as expressed in the forms of hainteny (poetry), kabary (public discourse) and ohabolana (proverbs).&#91;199&#93;&#91;200&#93; An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the Ibonia, has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.&#91;201&#93; This tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, who is considered Africa's first modern poet,&#91;202&#93; and Elie Rajaonarison, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.&#91;203&#93; Madagascar has also developed a rich musical heritage, embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal salegy or highland hiragasy that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.&#91;204&#93; Madagascar also has a growing culture of classical music fostered through youth academies, organizations and orchestras that promote youth involvement in classical music.
The plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island. In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.&#91;169&#93; Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.&#91;205&#93; The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.&#91;206&#93;
Among the Antaimoro people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.&#91;205&#93; Embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.&#91;169&#93; A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.&#91;207&#93;
A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.&#91;208&#93; The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions.&#91;209&#93; In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially the result of the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.&#91;210&#93;
Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries. Rugby union is considered the national sport of Madagascar.&#91;211&#93; Soccer is also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in pétanque, a French game similar to lawn bowling, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands.&#91;212&#93; School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. Madagascar sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964, and has also competed in the African Games.&#91;23&#93; Scouting is represented in Madagascar by its own local federation of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.&#91;213&#93;
Because of its advanced sports facilities, Antananarivo gained the hosting rights for several of Africa's top international basketball events, including the 2011 FIBA Africa Championship,&#91;214&#93; the 2009 FIBA Africa Championship for Women,&#91;215&#93; the 2014 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship,&#91;216&#93; the 2013 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship,&#91;217&#93; and the 2015 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship for Women.&#91;218&#93; Madagascar's national 3x3 basketball team won the gold medal at the 2019 African Games.
Malagasy cuisine reflects the diverse influences of Southeast Asian, African, Indian, Chinese and European culinary traditions. The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs. Throughout almost the entire island, the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar typically consists of a base of rice (vary) served with an accompaniment (laoka). The many varieties of laoka may be vegetarian or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger, onion, garlic, tomato, vanilla, coconut milk, salt, curry powder, green peppercorns or, less commonly, other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, pastoral families may replace rice with maize, cassava, or curds made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory fritters as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits. Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, herbal teas and teas, and alcoholic drinks such as rum, wine, and beer.&#91;198&#93; Three Horses Beer is the most popular beer on the island&#91;219&#93; and is considered emblematic of Madagascar.&#91;220&#93; The island also produces some of the world's finest chocolate; Chocolaterie Robert, established in 1940, is the most famous chocolate company on the island.&#91;221&#93;

Maurice Herzog (15 January 1919 ;&#8211;&#32;13 December 2012)&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93; was a French mountaineer and administrator who was born in Lyon, France. He led the 1950 French Annapurna expedition that first climbed a peak over 8000m, Annapurna, in 1950, and reached the summit with Louis Lachenal. Upon his return, he wrote a best-selling book about the expedition.
On 3 June 1950, Herzog and Louis Lachenal became the first climbers in modern history to climb a peak over 8000m when, on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition, they summited the Himalayan mountain Annapurna I, the 10th-highest mountain in the world.&#91;4&#93; The ascent was all the more remarkable because the peak was explored, reconnoitered and climbed all within one season; and was climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen. It is also the only 8000 meter summit that was reached at the first attempt.  Herzog was awarded the 1950 Gold Medal of the Société de Géographie.&#91;5&#93;
The event caused a huge sensation that was only matched when Everest was summited in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.
The two-week retreat from the peak proved very challenging. Both climbers had opted for light boots for the summit dash. This, combined with Herzog losing his gloves near the summit and a night spent bivouacked in a crevasse on the descent with one sleeping bag for four climbers (Lachenal, Gaston Rébuffat, Lionel Terray, and Herzog) resulted in severe frostbite, with consequent gangrene requiring the expedition doctor to perform emergency amputations in the field.&#91;6&#93; Both summit climbers lost all of their toes and Herzog most of his fingers.
Annapurna was not climbed again until 1970, when the French north face route was climbed by a British Army expedition, simultaneously with an ascent of the south face by an expedition led by British climber Chris Bonington.  The mountain's fourth ascent was not until 1977.&#91;7&#93;
Herzog's account of the expedition was published first in 1951 in French,&#91;8&#93; then in English in 1952 under the title Annapurna.  The book has sold over 11 ;million copies as of 2000, more than any other mountaineering title.&#91;9&#93; Ending with the stirring line "there are other Annapurnas in the lives of men" (in the context of the book, an exhortation to answer the challenges that life offers), the book gave an account of the expedition that established Herzog's climbing reputation and inspired a generation of mountaineers.
Some aspects of Herzog's account of the summit day have been called into question with the publication of other members’ accounts of the expedition, most significantly by a biography of Gaston Rébuffat and the posthumous publication, in 1996, of Lachenal's contemporaneous journals. The 2000 book True Summit: What Really Happened on the Legendary Ascent of Annapurna by David Roberts gives one view of the controversy.&#91;9&#93;
Herzog went on to become the French Minister of Youth and Sport from 1958 to 1963, and mayor of the alpine town of Chamonix-Mont-Blanc. He was a member of the International Olympic Committee for 25 years from 1970, and has an honorary member after 1995. He was a Grand Officer of the Legion d'Honneur and holder of the Croix de Guerre for military service 1939–45.&#91;10&#93;
Herzog was a 1944 graduate of the French business school HEC Paris.&#91;4&#93;

Louis Lachenal (17 July 1921 – 25 November 1955), a French climber born in Annecy, Haute-Savoie, was one of the first two mountaineers to climb a summit of more than 8,000 meters.  On 3 June 1950 on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition, along with Maurice Herzog, he reached the summit of Annapurna I in Nepal at a height of 8,091 m (26,545 ;ft). Previously he had made the second ascent of the North Face of the Eiger in 1947, with Lionel Terray. He died falling into a snow-covered crevasse while skiing the Vallee Blanche in Chamonix.&#91;1&#93; The mountain Pointe Lachenal in the Mont Blanc massif was named after him.&#91;2&#93;


The 1950 French Annapurna expedition, led by Maurice Herzog, reached the summit of Annapurna I at 8,091 metres (26,545 ;ft), the highest peak in the Annapurna Massif. The mountain is in Nepal and the government had given permission for the expedition, the first time it had permitted mountaineering in over a century. After failing to climb Dhaulagiri I at 8,167 metres (26,795 ;ft), the higher peak nearby to the west, the team attempted Annapurna with Herzog and Louis Lachenal, reaching the summit on 3 June 1950. It was only with considerable help from their team that they were able to return alive, though with severe injuries following frostbite.
Annapurna became the highest mountain to have been ascended to its summit, exceeding that achieved by the 1936 expedition to Nanda Devi, and the mountain was the first eight-thousander to be climbed. The feat was a great achievement for French mountaineering and caught the public imagination with front-page coverage in a best-selling issue of Paris Match. Herzog wrote a best-selling book Annapurna full of vivid descriptions of heroic endeavour and anguished suffering – but which much later was criticised for being too self-serving.
Annapurna is in the Eastern Himalaya in Nepal, and no one had attempted to climb the mountain before 1950. All pre–World War II Himalayan mountaineering expeditions had avoided Nepal and had travelled via Tibet or India, but in 1949, alarmed that the communists seemed to be gaining control in China, Tibet expelled all Chinese officials and closed its borders to foreigners. In October 1950 Tibet was occupied by the People's Republic of China and its borders remained closed indefinitely.&#91;1&#93;
For over one hundred years Nepal, ruled by the Rana dynasty, had not allowed explorers or mountaineers into the country. However, by 1946 a possible communist-sponsored revolution was even less welcome than Western influence so Nepal opened diplomatic discussions with the United States. Privately hoping to be able to use Nepal as a Cold War launching point for missiles, the United States welcomed the new situation. Scientific expeditions became permitted but two requests in 1948 from Switzerland and Britain for purely mountaineering expeditions were refused. A year later mountaineers were allowed if they were accompanying scientific travellers.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93; Nepal first gave permission for a full mountaineering expedition for a French attempt in 1950 on Dhaulagiri or Annapurna.&#91;4&#93;
Alpine mountaineering was immensely popular in France – the Fédération Française des clubs alpins et de montagne had 31,000 members in 1950 – and the top mountaineers were second only to footballers in their celebrity. Although French mountaineers included some of the leading alpinists in the world,&#91;note 1&#93; they had not ventured much beyond the Alps&#91;note 2&#93; whereas their British counterparts, with little truly mountainous terrain of their own and less skill on rock faces, had been reconnoitring Himalaya via an India that was no longer British.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; After the travails of war a mountaineering success would be good for the public mood.&#91;9&#93;
In 1949 the French Alpine Club requested permission from the Nepalese government to carry out a major expedition. The timing turned out to be ideal, and they were given permission to attempt to climb either Dhaulagiri or Annapurna in remote northwestern Nepal. The two mountain ranges, each consisting of many high peaks, are on each side of the great Kali Gandaki Gorge – Dhaulagiri ;I and Annapurna ;I, the highest in each range, are over 8,000 metres (26,000 ;ft) and there had been no previous attempts to climb these mountains.&#91;10&#93;&#91;note 3&#93; The region had only been casually explored previously and the mountain heights had been determined by surveyors with precision theodolites based far away in India.&#91;11&#93; Other nations felt that they should have been given priority but Nepal had favoured France.&#91;10&#93;&#91;12&#93; In Britain there had been the hope that international rivalry would cease after the war but this was not the view of the French government (who were providing one third of the resources) or of the banking and industrial sponsors, so the enterprise was to be strictly French.&#91;13&#93;
Lucien Devies ;&#91;fr&#93;, the most influential person in French mountaineering,&#91;note 4&#93; was responsible for gathering together a team and he chose Maurice Herzog, an experienced amateur climber, to be the leader of the expedition.&#91;note 5&#93; Accompanying him were to be three younger Chamonix professional mountain guides, Louis Lachenal, Lionel Terray and Gaston Rébuffat, and two amateurs Jean Couzy and Marcel Schatz ;&#91;fr&#93;. The doctor was Jacques Oudot ;&#91;fr&#93; and the interpreter and transport officer Francis de Noyelle ;&#91;fr&#93;, a diplomat. The only person who had previously been to the Himalaya was Marcel Ichac who was the expedition's photographer and cinematographer.&#91;10&#93;&#91;note 6&#93; The three mountain guides would have preferred an international approach whereas Herzog welcomed climbing for national prestige.&#91;17&#93; None were paid, not even the professional guides.&#91;18&#93; The Maharajah of Nepal appointed G.B. Rana to accompany the expedition for local liaison, translation and general organisation.&#91;19&#93;
Two days before the expedition departed, Devies gathered the French team together and required them to swear an oath that they would obey their leader in everything.&#91;20&#93;
On 30 March 1950 the French Annapurna Expedition&#91;note 7&#93; flew on an Air France DC-4 from Paris to New Delhi (with several refuelling stops).&#91;20&#93; They took 3.5 tons of supplies which included ropes and outer clothing of nylon, down-filled jackets and felt-lined leather boots with rubber soles – all innovative equipment. Most of their food was to be bought locally and they had decided not to take bottled oxygen. Another aircraft took them to Lucknow where they met Ang Tharkay, the expedition's highly experienced sirdar&#91;note 8&#93;&#91;20&#93; A train took them to Nautanwa where they met up with the other sherpas&#91;note 6&#93; and entered Nepal to travel on by truck through jungle and then grassy fields to Butwal where the road ended.&#91;20&#93;&#91;22&#93; On the march-in Lachenal and Terray would keep going on ahead as a scouting party while the rest followed with 150 porters carrying the supplies on their backs. Porters were paid according to the weight of their loads and they scorned the work they were being offered where the packs averaged about 40 kilograms (88 ;lb). However, they were willing to accept double loads of 80 kilograms (180 ;lb). Terray estimated the heaviest porter would not have had a body weight of over 80 kilograms.&#91;20&#93;&#91;23&#93;
Dhaulagiri and Annapurna are 34 kilometres (21 miles) apart on either side of the gorge of the Kali Gandaki river, a tributary of the Ganges.&#91;10&#93;&#91;25&#93; As the expedition approached from the south Dhaulagiri was clearly visible as a white pyramid to the west whereas Annapurna to the east was hidden behind the Nilgiri mountains. On first seeing Dhaulagiri on 17 April the immediate impression was that it was unclimbable. They could not see Annapurna but there was a break in the Nilgiris where the Miristi Kola flows into the Kali Gandaki through a deep and narrow gorge with an impenetrable entrance. The 1920s Survey of India map they were using (see left-hand Annapurna map below) showed a path leading up the gorge and over "Tilicho Pass" that might provide a route to the north face of Annapurna. However, none of the local inhabitants they spoke to knew of a path or had any further information. Continuing up the Kali Gandaki Gorge the team reached the market town of Tukusha at 2,600 metres (8,500 ;ft) on 21 April. The people lived there in primitive conditions – Terray described the place as having "biblical charm".&#91;note 9&#93; Couzy climbed a 4,000-metre (13,000 ;ft) Nilgiri peak to the east of Tukusha to inspect the eastern Dhaulagiri terrain and he concluded the southeast ridge was "absolutely frightful". Even so, Herzog decided that they should first focus on Dhaulagiri, the higher mountain, since they would only have to investigate possible routes to the summit and would not have to reconnoitre to find the mountain itself.&#91;27&#93;
Starting from Tukusha, the climbers Lachenal and Rébuffat headed for an initial exploration of Dhaulagiri's eastern glacier, while Herzog, Terray and Ichac went to the north where they found their 1920s map was seriously defective (see above).&#91;29&#93; Unlike Annapurna, Dhaulagiri is well separated from its neighbouring peaks and it is steep on all sides.&#91;30&#93; They found an unmapped region they called the "Hidden Valley" but from there they were unable to see the mountain at all. Over the next two weeks small groups examined the southeast and northeast ridges while Terray and Oudot reached a 5,300-metre (17,500 ;ft) pass (called French Pass) beyond the Hidden Valley but, although they were able to see Dhaulagiri, they decided the north face could not be climbed.&#91;29&#93; They were also able to see across to Annapurna in the distance where there were steep cliffs to the south but the northern profile did not look to be more than 35°.&#91;31&#93;
During this Dhaulagiri reconnaissance, Schatz, Couzy, Oudot and Ang Tharkay had been back south to explore the deep canyon of the Miristi Kola river. When they had previously passed that river on the march-in it seemed to have a greater flow than would be likely for the limited drainage basin shown on the map. To avoid the entrance to the gorge, the party climbed to the ridge of the Nilgiris from where they could see the ravine below was indeed impassable.&#91;note 10&#93;&#91;29&#93; However, traversing beside the ridge by following a slight path marked with cairns, they reached a point from which Schatz and Couzy were able to descend 910 metres (3,000 ;ft) to the river and from there they reached the base of Annapurna's northwest spur. They could not tell whether the spur, or the ice fields on either side of it, might provide a feasible route to the summit.&#91;34&#93;
With everyone back in Tukusha and with poor prospects of attaining either summit from the east, west or south, Herzog acted on the advice of a Buddhist lama that they should travel towards Muktinath on a route to the north and then east.&#91;29&#93;&#91;35&#93; Hoping they might be able to approach "Tilicho Pass" from the east along the track marked on their map, Rébuffat, Ichac and Herzog set off on 8 May crossing two passes north of a peak (now called Tilicho Peak) at each end of a frozen ice lake and discovering an unmapped wall of mountains to their south continuing beyond the lake and still blocking any view of Annapurna. This part of the Nilgiri range looping right round the north of Annapurna they called the "Great Barrier".&#91;29&#93; Ichac and Ang Tharkay stayed back to do accurate surveying and to climb north to a point at about 6,200 metres (20,300 ;ft) on a ridge, hoping the see the mountain over the Great Barrier – but everywhere was shrouded in mist. The main party reached the village of Manangbhot and explored slightly further before returning to Tukucha on the road via Muktinath. The expedition had been unable even to see Annapurna from the north, let alone discover a route to it. The map they had was so inaccurate that it was useless.&#91;36&#93;
With the start of the monsoon predicted for the first week in June, back in Tukusha on 14 May they held a meeting to discuss which mountain to attempt and along which particular route. Terray wrote: "In full awareness of his terrible responsibility Maurice chose the more reasonable but uncertain course: we would attempt Annapurna." The route would be the one reconnoitered by Schatz and Couzy's team.&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93;
Most of the party set out for the Miristi Kola as an advance reconnaissance group leaving most of the porters to bring the rest of stores and equipment later. They took with them the medical supplies deemed necessary by Oudot including Maxiton (the equivalent amphetamine preparation in Britain was Benzedrine&#91;39&#93;).&#91;40&#93; In three separate groups they crossed the Nilgiri range, traversed east above the Miristi Kola, and descended the gorge. Crossing the river they set up a base camp at the foot of a glacier below Annapurna's northwest spur. Two teams moved up the spur, a feat of considerable technical climbing,&#91;note 11&#93; but even after repeated attempts over five days they were unable to get higher than about 6,000 metres (20,000 ;ft).&#91;37&#93;&#91;42&#93;&#91;note 12&#93;
Meantime Lachenal and Rébuffat on their own initiative had moved round the foot of the spur to below Annapurna's north face, to a point they decided gave the best prospects for success.&#91;37&#93; They sent a note back to the main party saying there was a likely route up the side of the north face glacier leading to the plateau above. However, they could see no higher. Fortunately Terray and Herzog had been able to see the plateau from their high point on the northwest spur and could tell the route across the plateau to the top was not technically difficult.&#91;44&#93; Compared with the northwest spur, the north face of Annapurna is at a relatively low angle and does not require rock climbing skills, but the risk of avalanches makes it extremely dangerous.&#91;45&#93; Annapurna may well be the most dangerous 8,000-metre peak – as of 2000&#91;update&#93; for 38 successful ascents there had been 57 deaths.&#91;46&#93;
The party moved their base camp to the furthest point that could be reached by porters in the direction of the newly identified starting point – to the right bank of the North Annapurna glacier at 4,400 metres (14,500 ;ft)&#91;note 13&#93; while Couzy was left to organise moving the supplies up.&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93; Camp I was set up on the glacier at 5,110 metres (16,750 ;ft) with a relatively gentle slope up to the mountain but with a considerable risk of avalanches. From here on the first sunny afternoon in weeks they could survey the mountain easily. Herzog decided that the expedition's support should now move from Tukucha and so sent Sarki back with the order. Camp II was in the middle of a plateau above the north Annapurna glacier, fairly well sheltered from avalanches.&#91;37&#93;&#91;51&#93;&#91;50&#93; Each morning brought 0.30 metres (1 ;ft) or more of snow – making for slow progress – but after crossing an avalanche corridor they were able to establish Camp III among some seracs on the far side of the glacier and by 28 May they had established Camp IV below a curving cliff of ice that they called the "Sickle".&#91;52&#93;&#91;37&#93; Terray was amazed by the energy he and the team showed, considering how long they had been at high altitude and how little they had eaten. He wondered if this was due to the drugs Oudot had insisted on them taking regularly.&#91;53&#93;&#91;note 14&#93; On 25 May the porters arrived at Base Camp with supplies and equipment to support what would turn out to be a very fast, alpine-style assault on the mountain.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93;
Herzog's plan had been that he and Terray should rest before attempting the summit but the other four climbers became too exhausted to do their part of a carry to Camp IV so Terray (disobeying the orders he had received to go down from Camp III to Camp II) climbed with Rébuffat and a team of sherpas to carry up these loads.&#91;59&#93;&#91;60&#93; This unselfish act by Terray led to Herzog (who had acclimatised the best&#91;12&#93;) and Lachenal, accompanied by Ang Tharkay and Sarki, being the ones who set out from Camp II on 31 May for an attempt on the summit. Next day Herzog's team moved Camp IV to a better site at the top of the Sickle cliff (Camp IVA) and then on 2 June they climbed a gully through the Sickle to establish Camp V, their assault camp, on the snow fields above.&#91;61&#93; With the monsoon now forecast for 5 June, time was extremely tight.&#91;62&#93; Herzog offered Ang Tharkay and Sarki the opportunity to accompany them to the summit but they turned down what would have been a great honour.&#91;note 15&#93; The two sherpas headed back to Camp IVA.&#91;63&#93;
Lachenal was anxious to go down as soon as possible but he obliged Herzog by photographing his leader holding the Tricolour on the summit and then a pennant from Kléber, his sponsoring employer.&#91;70&#93;&#91;note 17&#93; After about an hour on the summit, not waiting for Herzog in his euphoric state to load another roll of film, Lachenal set off back down at a furious pace. Herzog, swallowing the last of his food – from a nearly empty tube of condensed milk – threw the tube down on the summit as that was the only memorial he could leave and he trailed behind Lachenal into a gathering storm.&#91;70&#93;&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93;
At some stage Herzog took his gloves off and laid them down to open his pack. Catastrophically they slid away down the mountain so he had to continue bare-handed, not thinking to use the spare socks he had with him.&#91;75&#93; At Camp V he was met by Terray and Rébuffat who had brought up a second tent hoping to make their own summit attempt the next day&#91;note 18&#93; and who were horrified at the state of Herzog's frostbitten hands.&#91;75&#93;&#91;78&#93; Lachenal was missing but Herzog, unable to think clearly, said he would be arriving soon. Later they heard Lachenal calling for help – he had taken a long fall to below the camp, had lost his ice axe and a crampon, and his feet were seriously frostbitten. Terray scrambled down to him and he pleaded to be taken down to Camp II and medical help. At last Terray persuaded him to go back up to Camp V, the only responsible decision.&#91;79&#93; Terray plied everyone with hot drinks through the night and whipped Lachenal's toes with the end of a rope for hours to try and restore the blood circulation – in the other tent Rébuffat did likewise for Herzog's fingers and toes.&#91;note 19&#93;&#91;81&#93;
Couzy was at the camp so he and Schatz were able to assist Herzog, Rébuffat and Lachenal down the Sickle cliff to Camp IV where there were some sherpas sheltering. Meanwhile, Terray had chosen to stay at IVA trying to get the blood circulation back into his feet. Schatz climbed back up to help him descend, also taking the opportunity to recover the still camera from the crevasse shelter – the cine camera he could not find. As the six climbers descended below Camp IV the air temperature rose rapidly and a crack appeared in the snow right under Herzog's roped group. An avalanche swept them down about 150 metres (500 ;ft) until their rope caught on a ridge. Herzog was left dangling upside down with his rope round his neck while his two sherpas were caught on their end of the rope. Descending further in agony Herzog was becoming reconciled to being close to death. Eventually they reached the comparative safety of Camp II. Herzog now felt he had succeeded as leader – even if he now died his companions would be safe and the mountain had been conquered.&#91;86&#93;
At Camp II Oudot, the physician, injected Herzog and Lachenal to help improve their blood flow. The injections in the arteries of legs and arms were excruciatingly painful and they needed to be repeated for many days afterwards.&#91;note 20&#93; On 7 June everyone started descending again with Herzog, Lachenal and Rébuffat lying on sledges. Needing to hurry before the monsoon made the Miristi Kola impassable through flooding, they reached Camp I as the sky clouded over and heavy rains started. From here, on 8 June, they wrote a telegram, announcing that Annapurna had been climbed, to be taken by a runner for sending to Devies in Paris. The route to Base Camp was over terrain unsuitable for sledges so Herzog and Lachenal were carried on the backs of sherpas. Once at base, and just at the right time, a large team of porters arrived to transport the whole expedition back to Lete on the Gandaki River.&#91;89&#93;
Specially for the expedition, All India Radio broadcast a report that the monsoon would be reaching them the next day, 10 June.&#91;90&#93; The heavy rain would become torrential and the rivers would rise. A team led by Schatz built a makeshift bridge over the Miristi Kola and everyone hurried towards the bridge along paths that required Lachenal to be carried in a human cacolet and Herzog in a wicker basket.&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93; They became stranded in the open when it became too dark to carry the casualties safely. Next morning they reached a camp by the bridge but the river had risen to only 0.30 metres (1 ;ft) below the span so they needed to undertake the difficult crossing immediately. Everyone got across and camped for the night – by morning the bridge had been swept away. They had hoped to follow the river down to where it joined the Kali Gandaki but a reconnaissance showed this would be impossible and so they were forced to climb the Nilgiri ridge to return the way they had come. Now down in the jungle, Herzog developed a fever and reached a very low ebb: "... I implored death to come and deliver me. I had lost the will to live, and I was giving in – the ultimate humiliation ...", he wrote afterwards in his book Annapurna. The casualties could now be carried in wicker chairs made to a design of Terray and they eventually reached the Gandaki.&#91;90&#93;
The telegram giving news of the success was reported by Le Figaro on 16 June but it was only on 17 July that the team arrived home at Orly Airport in Paris to be greeted by a wildly cheering crowd. Herzog was carried off the aircraft first.&#91;97&#93; Paris Match printed a special edition for 19 August with articles about the expedition and the cover photo, taken by Lachenal but credited to Ichac, showing Herzog with his ice axe and Tricolour at the summit (see image at head of article). The magazine sold in record numbers and the photo remained an iconic image for years to come.&#91;note 21&#93; Herzog, Lachenal and Ang Tharkay were awarded the Légion d'honneur.&#91;note 22&#93;&#91;85&#93;&#91;101&#93; On 17 February 1951 Paris Match again ran the expedition on its front cover, this time focusing on the cinema premiere (attended by the President of France) of the film made by Ichac. The cover described Herzog as "our number one national hero" – in the accompanying six-page article Lachenal was not mentioned at all.&#91;102&#93;
Herzog was kept at the American hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine for the best part of a year where he dictated his book Annapurna, premier 8000 which sold over 11 ;million copies worldwide to become the best selling mountaineering book in history.&#91;note 23&#93; He became the first international mountaineering celebrity after George Mallory and went on to be a successful politician.&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93;&#91;106&#93; Fifty years later in France he was still as famous as Jacques Cousteau or Jean-Claude Killy whereas few remembered Lachenal or any of the others.&#91;105&#93;
In June 2000, the French national postal services issued a 3 franc stamp (0.46 euro) celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the climb, designed by Jean-Paul Cousin and engraved by André Lavergne.&#91;107&#93;
Over the following years several members of the expedition wrote about their experiences[bibliography] and the varied accounts eventually led to controversy.&#91;108&#93; At the airport, before setting off on the expedition, Herzog had required each member of the team to sign an undertaking not to publish or publicly communicate anything about the expedition for five years so initially Herzog's was the only version of events to be known.&#91;109&#93; However, in 1996 two very different accounts were published and "a storm of controversy seized France".&#91;110&#93; Herzog responded in 1998. After speaking to many of the people involved who were still alive,&#91;note 24&#93; in 2000 David Roberts, the American mountaineer and writer, published True Summit, discussing the whole issue.&#91;note 25&#93;&#91;111&#93;
For some years Herzog's Annapurna&#91;112&#93; was the only account and it became a worldwide best-seller with over 11 ;million sales, a record for a mountaineering book.&#91;105&#93; All the royalties from the publication (in France it remained the best-selling work of non-fiction for nearly a year) went to the Himalayan Committee and were used to fund future expeditions – in a direct sense Herzog did not benefit financially at all.&#91;113&#93; The description of the expedition above in this article has generally been drawn from Herzog's book complemented by the "Annapurna" chapter from Terray's Conquistadors of the Useless.&#91;114&#93;&#91;38&#93;
James Ramsey Ullman wrote in the New York Herald Tribune that Annapurna was "a gallant and moving story, in some ways a terrible story" predicting it would become a mountaineering classic. Time wrote that the first half was like "a boy camper's letter to a chum" but what followed was a "harrowing ordeal-by-nature calculated to shiver the spirit of the toughest armchair explorer."&#91;115&#93; Herzog and Ichac published a photographic book in 1951 Regards vers l'Annapurna&#91;116&#93; and in 1981 Herzog published a historical work Les grandes aventures de l'Himalaya&#91;117&#93; which had a section on Annapurna.&#91;118&#93;
In the preface to the 1951 book Devies concentrates almost exclusively on the leader of the team: "The victory of the whole party was also, and above all, the victory of its leader".&#91;119&#93; Herzog told of a happy team, all pulling together although at times Lachenal could be impetuous.&#91;120&#93; Rarely did he mention any disagreement between team members and he, as leader, could resolve any spats quite easily.&#91;121&#93; He very often quoted as direct speech the jaunty sort of remarks members of the team might have made, even on occasions when he was not present to have heard them.&#91;122&#93;
Lachenal had kept notes and a diary and he was about to publish a book, Carnets du vertige, when he was killed in a skiing accident in 1955. Herzog took over Lachenal's work and he and Lucien Devies marked in many editorial suggestions for deletions before passing it to Herzog's brother, Gérard Herzog ;&#91;fr&#93;, for full editing.&#91;123&#93; As published, the book comprised chapters about Lachenal's life written by Gérard Herzog from Lachenal's notes and material written by a journalist Philippe Cornuau who had been helping Lachenal with his draft – Cornuau said that when he had handed over the typescripts he had no idea of what was going to happen. None of what Lachenal or Cornuau had written appeared in the eventual publication.&#91;124&#93; The book also included extracts from Lachenal's diary but only after many redactions – it was mostly the more congenial remarks that remained.&#91;125&#93;
Lachenal had also left a typescript of some "Commentaires", intended to be published along with his diary. Herzog is commended as being as good as the professional guides for his stamina and technique, but, less agreeably for Herzog and Devies, he characterised the descent from the summit as a "débandade" (disorderly retreat) beside which on the typescript Devies jotted down "But no" and Maurice Herzog "Is this the place to say so?". When Lachenal had wanted to turn back before the summit Herzog thought it was his encouragement that had enabled Lachenal to continue. However Lachenal wrote that he agreed to go on because he thought that Herzog would not succeed in getting back down again alone. Herzog wrote in the margin of the typescript: "I didn't sense this. Perhaps after all I was unfair." On the other hand, Devies noted: "This must all be rewritten". In the event Gérard Herzog did not include any of the "Commentaires". The book&#91;126&#93; was published in 1956 and Cornuau was shocked by what he read.&#91;127&#93;
Terray's 1961 book, Les conquérants de l'inutile&#91;128&#93;&#91;note 26&#93; (published in English as "The Conquistadors of the Useless") included a long chapter about the Annapurna expedition.&#91;130&#93; It was deliberately written to complement Herzog's book.&#91;131&#93;&#91;note 27&#93; He provided a great deal of additional information but finishing with the avalanche on the way down to Camp II. Generally the book did not disagree with Herzog but did commend Lachenal's climbing ability: he said "Lachenal was by far the fastest and most brilliant climber I have ever known on delicate or loose terrain" but he could however lack patience and stamina.&#91;132&#93;
The book contained many revelations. Rébuffat had been shocked by the requirement for an oath of obedience and he described it as "a certain Nazification".&#91;20&#93;&#91;136&#93; He considered it had been his initiative that led to the discovery of the eventual climbing route to the summit and that Herzog had not given him the credit for this.&#91;137&#93; When in 1951 Lachenal had told Rébuffat that when he had been considering publishing an account of the expedition, someone from the official Himalayan Committee had threatened him that he might lose his job at the École Nationale de Ski et d'Alpinisme.&#91;138&#93;
The same year Michel Guérin of Éditions Guérin ;&#91;fr&#93;, the mountaineering publisher, published an unexpurgated version of Lachenal's diary, also including the "Commentaires", under the same title Carnets du vertige.&#91;139&#93; The original manuscript had been left to Lachenal's son Jean-Claude, who had become angry with the changes the editors had made in 1956. However, Herzog had befriended the Lachenal family and Jean-Claude had not wanted to cause any hurt. Eventually Guérin persuaded him to allow full publication.&#91;140&#93;
There was a favourable book review in the Alpine Journal that provided an assessment of the situation. It was because he was a professional mountain guide that Lachenal had continued with Herzog to the summit. By doing so, through frostbite, he lost the ability to continue his career – and allowed Herzog to triumph in his.&#91;141&#93;
In his diaries Lachenal admitted that a sherpa had fallen to his death from the Nilgiri ridge on their return march but no one else had mentioned this. No one else wrote of the daily use of morphine as a pain-killer while the casualties were being carried out and that Rébuffat was the only person who was attentive to Lachenal.&#91;142&#93; Back in 1956 the text Gérard Herzog had excluded was about matters he considered too unpleasant for publication such as the climbers being offered young girls for sex and, when this was refused, being offered young boys instead. Minor comments had also been edited: "Evening, the eternal chicken and potatoes" had been removed while "We opened a bottle of white wine" had been kept.&#91;143&#93;
The publication of these books in 1996 had caused serious controversy: mountaineering journalists started expressing doubts about the reliability of Herzog's book. Herzog's rejoinder was to publish a memoir L'autre Annapurna&#91;144&#93; in 1998 when he was eighty years old.&#91;145&#93;
Interviewed by Roberts in 1999, Herzog told him the controversy had not bothered him. No one had doubted what he had written. He had shown the manuscript of Annapurna to everyone who had been on the expedition and they were impressed – even Lachenal. Contradicting his 1951 account, he said his frostbite had not been caused by losing his gloves because he had simply put his hands in his pockets. Instead, the cause was digging in the snow in their overnight crevasse trying to find the buried boots. Indeed, in L'autre Annapurna he did not mention losing his gloves at all. Explaining various differences between his two accounts Herzog said Annapurna was a novel, but a true novel. He considered his first book to be objective and the other was subjective.&#91;152&#93;
The combination of Rébuffat's disillusioned story and the obvious censorship of Lachenal's writing caused a storm of revisionism in the French press. Frédéric Potet wrote: "The whole world remembers Maurice Herzog, the first biped to have trod, in 1950, atop a mountain of more than 8,000 metres. The others – Rébuffat, Terray, Lachenal? Who were they? Where did they come from? What did they do?" Major newspapers in France and mountaineering magazines worldwide joined the criticism. In the American Alpine Journal: "I am sorry we have had to wait so long for the true story. All around us we can see the damage done by false information."&#91;153&#93;&#91;154&#93;&#91;note 31&#93;
La Montagne et Alpinisme, however, considered there was too much fuss: five-year embargoes were normal in 1950 and the distinction between professional guides and amateur climbers had lost any significance by that time.&#91;155&#93;
Montagnes magazine investigated and reported that Terray had not received the Légion d'honneur because Devies and Herzog had been opposed to it. They also found that, despite rumours that several mountaineers had been seriously injured, their wives waiting anxiously at home were told nothing by Devies because of the exclusive publication contract with Le Figaro and Paris Match. Le Monde discovered that before leaving for France Ichac had searched Rébuffat bodily to check he was not smuggling back any film. Ichac had not gone above Camp II so Rébuffat had taken all the higher photographs except those at the summit taken by Lachenal and one by Herzog. Despite this, all published photographs were credited to Ichac. It later emerged that Rébuffat succeeded in covertly bringing back the film used by Lachenal and he developed it before returning all the photographs but one to Ichac. The one he kept back, which he kept for the rest of his life, had been too embarrassing for Lachenal to bear becoming public – the one of Herzog waving the tyre company Kléber's pennant on the summit.&#91;156&#93;&#91;note 17&#93;
Interviewed by Le Monde, Herzog said "What I wrote in Annapurna is the exact truth. ... My writings have never been contradicted." To Montagnes he said the passages had been removed from Lachenal's book because they did not interest the editors.&#91;157&#93;
The 1998 publication of Herzog's L'autre Annapurna again stirred up the press. In an interview Herzog now said Lachenal was an excessive personality and he and Devies had removed passages from Lachenal's draft to avoid charges of defamation and to keep things calm. He said Herzog's brother had helped Lachenal because he was incapable of writing, that Lachenal was very happy with the rewrite and that Lachenal's son had made up the story about the draft being distorted. The sherpa Foutharkay was drawn into the arguments, saying that Sir Edmund Hillary was a hero in Nepal but Herzog not so.&#91;158&#93;
Roberts' book about the controversy has itself also been criticised. In reviewing True Summit the American Alpine Journal said "David Roberts has none of the Himalayan expedition experience necessary to put the events in context."&#91;159&#93;
Even as far back as 1950 a small number of people doubted the expedition had reached the summit. One of the problems was the famous "summit photo"  (see image at head of article) that seems to show the ground sloping up higher than Herzog's feet. Also, after Lachenal's death it was claimed he used to say he had no memory of the summit, or another version was that he had once said had not got there at all. Even fifty years later there were doubts from a small minority. Herzog had written there was a fierce wind at the summit but in the photo he seems to be having to hold the flag out straight. The only summit photograph taken by Herzog, one of Lachenal, he kept hidden until after Lachenal's death. This blurred image shows him sitting leaning against a rock not looking at all victorious.&#91;160&#93;
On the other hand, Terray wrote that, although Lachenal could not remember anything of the descent, he had told Terray of his feelings at the summit: "Those moments when one had expected a fugitive and piercing happiness had in fact brought only a painful sense of emptiness." Rébuffat's wife said her husband had never doubted they had got there. His journal recorded that, when they met up at Camp V, Herzog suggested Rébuffat and Terray go up to the summit while Herzog and Lachenal continued down. They would have noticed if their footprints had not extended all the way to the top.&#91;161&#93;
Also, Lachenal's diary says he took the summit photographs from a ledge slightly below the summit. When Herzog was interviewed by Le Monde he said that what appeared in the photographs like an arête of snow receding away upwards was actually very close and only reached to his waist. It was a cornice at the crest of the summit, too weak to be trodden on. In 1970 Henry Day took part in an expedition ascending using much the same route and they were able to take photographs with very similar perspectives. Lachenal had the reputation of being an honest man, even bluntly honest. This, and the likelihood that he had little personal reason to fake his private diary, leaves little doubt about its accuracy – it is very widely accepted that they did indeed reach the top of Annapurna.&#91;161&#93;&#91;162&#93;&#91;163&#93; In his book Annapurna: 50 Years of Expeditions in the Death Zone (2000) Reinhold Messner regarded it as "an indisputable fact".&#91;164&#93;

In chronological order of first (French) publication.

The International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation or UIAA recognise eight-thousanders as the 14 mountains that are more than 8,000 metres (26,247 ;ft) in height above sea level, and are considered to be sufficiently independent from neighbouring peaks.  However, there is no precise definition of the criteria used to assess independence, and since 2012 the UIAA has been involved in a process to consider whether the list should be expanded to 20 mountains.  All eight-thousanders are located in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges in Asia, and their summits are in the death zone.
The first person to summit all 14 eight-thousanders was Italian Reinhold Messner in 1986, who completed the feat without the aid of supplementary oxygen. In 2010, Basque Edurne Pasaban became the first woman to summit all 14 eight-thousanders, but with the aid of supplementary oxygen; in 2011 Austrian Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to summit all 14 eight-thousanders without the aid of supplementary oxygen. From 1950–1964, all eight-thousanders were summited. As of May 2019&#91;update&#93;, K2 remains the only eight-thousander not summited in a winter ascent.
On 29 October 2019, Nepalese climber Nirmal Purja, set a new speed record by climbing the 14 eight-thousanders in 6 months and 6 days.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;
The first recorded attempt on an eight-thousander was when Albert F. Mummery and J. Norman Collie tried to climb Pakistan's Nanga Parbat in 1895. The attempt failed when Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir, and Goman Singh, were killed by an avalanche.&#91;3&#93;
The first recorded successful ascent of an eight-thousander was by the French Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal, who reached the summit of Annapurna on 3 June 1950 during the 1950 French Annapurna expedition .&#91;4&#93; The first winter ascent of an eight-thousander was done by a Polish team led by Andrzej Zawada on Mount Everest. Two climbers Leszek Cichy and  Krzysztof Wielicki reached the summit on 17 February 1980.&#91;5&#93;
The first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders was Italian Reinhold Messner, on 16 October 1986. In 1987, Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka became the second person to accomplish this feat. Kukuczka is also the man who established the most new routes (9) on the main eight-thousanders. Messner summited each of the 14 peaks without the aid of bottled oxygen. This feat was not repeated until nine years later by the Swiss Erhard Loretan in 1995. Phurba Tashi of Nepal has completed the most climbs of the eight-thousanders, with 30 ascents between 1998 and 2011.&#91;6&#93; Juanito Oiarzabal has completed the second most, with a total of 25 ascents between 1985 and 2011.&#91;7&#93;
The Italian Simone Moro made the most first winter ascents of eight-thousanders (4); Jerzy Kukuczka made four winter ascents as well, but one was a repetition. As of May 2019&#91;update&#93;, K2 remains the only eight-thousander that has never been summited during the winter season.&#91;8&#93;
In 2010, Spanish climber Edurne Pasaban, became the first woman to summit all 14 eight-thousanders with no disputed climbing.&#91;10&#93; In August 2011, Austrian climber Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to climb the 14 eight-thousanders without the use of supplementary oxygen.&#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93;
The first couple and team who summited all 14 eight-thousanders together were the Italians Nives Meroi (second woman without supplementary oxygen), and her husband Romano Benet in 2017. The couple climbed alpine style, without the use of supplementary oxygen and other aids.&#91;13&#93;
As of November 2018&#91;update&#93;, the country with the most climbers to have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders is Italy with seven climbers, followed by Spain with six climbers, and South Korea with five climbers. Kazakhstan and Poland each have three climbers who have completed the "Crown of the Himalaya" (all 14 eight-thousanders).
On 29 October 2019, former Nepalese Gurka, and Special Boat Service (SBS) elite soldier Nirmal Purja, set a new speed record by climbing the 14 eight-thousanders in 6 months and 6 days, beating the previous record of just under 8 years.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93;
  Tenzing Norgay
In 2012, to relieve capacity pressure,&#91;22&#93; and develop climbing tourism, Nepal lobbied the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (or UIAA) to reclassify five summits (two on Lhotse and three on Kanchenjunga), as standalone eight-thousanders, while Pakistan lobbied for a sixth summit (on Broad Peak)&#91;23&#93; In 2012, the UIAA set up a project group to consider the proposals called the AGURA Project.&#91;23&#93; The six proposed summits for reclassification are subsidiary-summits of existing eight-thousanders, but which are also themselves above 8,000 metres and have a prominence above 60 metres.
The proposed six new eight-thousander peaks would not meet the wider UIAA criteria of 600 metres of elevation from nearest larger mountain's saddle, called topographic prominence, as used by the UIAA elsewhere for major mountains (the lowest prominence of the existing 14 eight-thousanders is Lhotse, at 610 metres).&#91;26&#93;&#91;27&#93;  For example, only Broad Peak Central, with a topographic prominence of 181 metres, would even meet the 150–metre prominence threshold to be a British Isles Marilyn.&#91;26&#93;  However, the appeal noted the UIAA's 1994 reclassification of Alpine 4,000-metre peaks where a prominence threshold of 30 metres was used, amongst other criteria; the logic being that if 30 metres worked for 4,000-metre summits, then 60 metres is proportional for 8,000m summits.&#91;28&#93;
As of November 2018&#91;update&#93;, there has been no conclusion by the UIAA and the proposals appear to have been set aside.
There is no single undisputed source for verified Himalayan ascents, however, Elizabeth Hawley's The Himalayan Database,&#91;29&#93; is considered as an important source for the Nepalese Himalayas.&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93;  Online ascent databases pay close regard to The Himalayan Database, including the website AdventureStats.com,&#91;32&#93; and the Eberhard Jurgalski List.&#91;33&#93; Various mountaineering journals, including the Alpine Journal and the American Alpine Journal,  maintain extensive records and archives but do not always opine on ascents.
The "No O2" column lists people who have climbed all 14 eight-thousanders without supplementary oxygen.
Claims have been made for all 14 peaks in which not enough evidence was provided to verify the ascent. The disputed ascent in each claim is shown in parentheses.  In most cases, the Himalayan chronicler Elizabeth Hawley is considered the definitive source regarding the facts of the dispute. Her The Himalayan Database is the source for other online Himalayan ascent databases (e.g. AdventureStats.com).&#91;30&#93;&#91;31&#93;
Cho Oyu is a recurrent problem peak as it is a small hump about 30 mins into the summit plateau, and the main proxy of a view of Everest, which is possible from the true summit, requires clear weather.&#91;68&#93;&#91;69&#93;  Shishapangma is another problem peak because of its dual summits, which despite being close in height, are up to two hours climbing time apart.&#91;70&#93; Hawley judged that Ed Viesturs had not reached the true summit, and he re-climbed the mountain to definitively establish his ascent.&#91;71&#93;

The air show continued to be held at the Grand Palais, and from 1949 flying demonstrations were staged at Paris Orly Airport.&#91;8&#93; In 1953, the show was relocated from the Grand Palais to Le Bourget.&#91;9&#93; The show was drawing international notice in the 1960s.&#91;10&#93; Since the 1970s, the show has emerged as the main international reference of the aeronautical sector.&#91;11&#93;
"The largest plane in the world," the Boeing 747 jet airliner, arrived on June 3, after flying non-stop from Seattle, Washington,&#91;16&#93; and the Apollo 8 command module, charred by its re-entry, was there flanked by the Apollo 9 astronauts, but the most-viewed exhibit was the supersonic Concorde, which made its first flight over Paris as the show opened.&#91;17&#93;
The Soviet TU-144 supersonic airliner was flown to Le Bourget for the 1971 show,&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93; drawing comparisons with the French Concorde.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93; Landing with the Concorde was the world's largest aircraft, the American Lockheed C-5A Galaxy.&#91;22&#93;
The crash of the Soviet Tu-144, see below, overshadowed the 1973 show, otherwise characterized by "There was nothing new", although the flying was memorable,&#91;23&#93; and there were a great many exhibits.&#91;24&#93;
One hundred and eighty-two aircraft were scheduled for appearance.&#91;25&#93; Despite restrictions that followed the TU-144 crash in 1973, a day of flying pleased viewers. In particular, the American YF-16 and the French Mirage F-1E competed in turn before a critical audience.&#91;26&#93; Days later, Belgium became the fourth European nation to choose the YF-16 over the F-1E.&#91;27&#93;
Celebration of Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic flight to Le Bourget fifty years ago recalled that historic event.&#91;28&#93; Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Lindbergh's widow, attended the ceremony along with early trans-Atlantic pilots, Maurice Bellonte and Armand Lotti.&#91;29&#93; Recent extension of coastal limits to 200 nautical miles has produced new maritime-reconnaissance (MR) aircraft.&#91;30&#93; The crash of a Fairchild A-10 tank-destroyer&#91;29&#93; led to tightened rules on air show demonstrations.&#91;31&#93;
Two airliners, the Airbus A310 and the Boeing 767, are competing for the international market, but neither will carry passengers before 1982.&#91;32&#93; The Westland WG30 transport helicopter shows promise.&#91;33&#93; "The Mirage 4000 remains a question mark"&#91;34&#93; despite being "surely the main highlight this year at Le Bourget."&#91;35&#93;
Exhibiting at the show, Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas/Fokker vie for the 150-seat airline market, while Rolls Royce/Japan, General Electric/Snecma (CFM), and Pratt &amp; Whitney contest for their engines.&#91;36&#93; The Northrop F-5G Tigershark mockup was on display and expected to fly in 1982 with delivery the following year. A novelty was Air Transat, a light aircraft trans-Atlantic race from Le Bourget to Sikorsky Memorial Airport, Bridgeport, Connecticut and back,&#91;37&#93; won by a twin engine Piper Navaho&#91;38&#93; and a Beechcraft Bonanza.&#91;39&#93;
The American Space Shuttle Enterprise was flown around Paris and towered over other exhibits,&#91;40&#93; but "much more intriguing"&#91;41&#93; were replicas of two twin-engined fighters, the British Aerospace ACA&#91;42&#93; and French Dassault Breguet ACX.&#91;43&#93; Sales of Boeing 757 and Airbus A310 airliners to Singapore Airlines were welcome news during an ongoing recession.&#91;44&#93;
The Soviet Antonov An-124 Ruslan military heavy lifter was the largest exhibit in 1985.&#91;45&#93; Propfan engines stirred interest.&#91;46&#93; Reflecting the upturn in the economy, Boeing and Airbus announced new contracts totaling as much as $1,700 ;million.&#91;47&#93; The Hubble Space Telescope&#91;48&#93; should be deployed in 1986.&#91;49&#93;
Newly introduced, in the rain, were the Soviet Mil Mi-34 Helicopter,&#91;50&#93; the Israeli Super Phantom,&#91;51&#93; and the Harrier GR.5.&#91;52&#93; Airbus announced firm orders for both the A330 and A340 airliners.&#91;53&#93; Exhibiting at the show for the first time, the Chinese displayed, among others, the A-5C Attacker (Fantan) and FT-7.&#91;54&#93; Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who flew a Voyager non-stop around the world without refueling, were present, but their aircraft was not.&#91;55&#93;
Despite a Department of Defense display of the Stealth bomber&#91;57&#93; and other Gulf War armaments,&#91;58&#93; most American contractors stayed home, so Soviet aircraft drew attention,&#91;59&#93; among them the Beriev Be-42 Mermaid (A-40 Albatros) amphibian,&#91;60&#93; the MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor,&#91;61&#93; and the Yak-141 short take-off/vertical landing (ASTOVL) supersonic fighter.&#91;62&#93; When it receives its first customer order, Dassault plans to begin production of the Mirage 2000-5, which is a "new machine compared to the basic Mirage 2000."&#91;63&#93;
The show attracted 1,611 exhibitors from 39 countries and nearly 300,000 visitors attended the show.&#91;64&#93; Dassault featured the debut of the Falcon 2000,&#91;65&#93; and Airbus will manufacture the 130-seat A319.&#91;66&#93;

The 48th International Paris Air Show took place in 2009 and marked a hundred years of technological innovation in aeronautics and space conquest. The event was held from 15 to 21 June, at Le Bourget. A memorial service was held for the victims of Air France Flight 447.&#91;107&#93;
The 2011 show was the 49th presentation, and hosted over 2,100 international exhibitors in 28 international pavilions. A total of 150 aircraft were on display, including the solar-electric aircraft Solar Impulse.&#91;108&#93;
A demo A380 was damaged the day before the exhibition opened and needed a replacement;&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93; while the new Airbus A400M Atlas military transport aircraft had an engine failure, but could still perform some demonstration flights.&#91;110&#93;
A Convair B-58 Hustler crashed while doing low-altitude aerobatics. The aircraft reportedly flew into a cloud bank, where visual reference was lost, and crashed.&#91;116&#93;
Another Convair B-58 crashed while on final approach during an overweight landing. The aircraft touched down short of the runway, killing United States Air Force Lt. Colonel Charles D. Tubbs. Two other crewmen were injured.&#91;117&#93;
A Fairchild-Hiller FH-1100 helicopter crashed killing the pilot. Witnesses of the crash cite seeing "something wrong with the main rotor".&#91;118&#93;
At the Paris Air Show on June 3, 1973, the second Tupolev Tu-144 production aircraft (registration SSSR-77102) crashed during its display. It stalled while attempting a rapid climb. Trying to pull out of the subsequent dive, the aircraft broke up and crashed, destroying 15 houses and killing all six on board and eight on the ground; a further sixty people received serious injuries.
The cause of this accident remains controversial. Theories include: the Tu-144 climbed to avoid a French Mirage chase plane whose pilot was attempting to photograph it; that changes had been made by the ground engineering team to the auto-stabilisation circuits to allow the Tu-144 to outperform the Concorde in the display circuit; and that the crew were attempting a manoeuvre and to outshine the Concorde.

The Tupolev Tu-144 (Russian: Tyполев Ту-144; NATO reporting name: Charger) is a Soviet supersonic passenger airliner designed by Tupolev in operation from 1968 to 1999.&#91;2&#93;
The Tu-144 was the world's first commercial supersonic transport aircraft with its prototype's maiden flight from Zhukovsky Airport on 31 December 1968, three months before the British-French Concorde.&#91;1&#93;&#91;3&#93;  The Tu-144 was a product of the Tupolev Design Bureau, an OKB headed by aeronautics pioneer Alexei Tupolev, and 16 aircraft were manufactured by the Voronezh Aircraft Production Association in Voronezh.&#91;1&#93; The Tu-144 conducted 102 commercial flights, of which only 55 carried passengers, at an average service altitude of 16,000 metres (52,000 ;ft) and cruised at a speed of around 2,000 kilometres per hour (1,200 ;mph) (Mach 1.6).&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; The Tu-144 first went supersonic on 5 June 1969, four months before Concorde, and on 26 May 1970 became the world's first commercial transport to exceed Mach 2.&#91;6&#93;
The Tu-144 suffered from reliability and developmental issues, and with the 1973 Paris Air Show crash, restricted the viability for regular use. The Tu-144 was introduced into passenger service with Aeroflot between Moscow and Almaty on 26 December 1975, but withdrawn less than three years later after a second Tu-144 crashed and retired on 1 June 1978. The Tu-144 remained in commercial service as a cargo aircraft until cancellation of the Tu-144 program in 1983. The Tu-144 was later used by the Soviet space program to train pilots of the Buran spacecraft, and by NASA for supersonic research until 1999. The Tu-144 made its final flight on 26 June 1999 and surviving aircraft were put on display across the world or into storage.
Despite the similarity in appearance of the Tu-144 to the Anglo-French supersonic aircraft, there were significant differences between two aircraft. The Tu-144 is bigger and faster than the Concorde (M2.15 vs. M2.04). Concorde used an electronic engine control package from Lucas, which Tupolev was not permitted to purchase for the Tu-144 as it could also be used on military aircraft. Concorde's designers used fuel as coolant for the cabin air conditioning and for the hydraulic system (see Concorde for details). Tupolev also used fuel/hydraulic heat exchangers but used cooling turbines for the cabin air.&#91;7&#93;:p.187
The Tu-144 prototype was a full-scale demonstrator aircraft with the very different production aircraft being developed in parallel. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including spanwise and chordwise camber.&#91;7&#93; They also added two small retractable surfaces called a moustache canard, with fixed double-slotted leading-edge slats and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.
Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift (force), but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to 315–333 ;km/h (196–207 ;mph; 170–180 ;kn), still faster than that of Concorde.&#91;8&#93; The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu-144LL test flights as 315–335 ;km/h (196–208 ;mph; 170–181 ;kn). An FAA circular lists Tu-144S approach speed as 329 ;km/h (204 ;mph; 178 ;kn), as opposed to Concorde's approach speed of 300 ;km/h (190 ;mph; 160 ;kn), based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies.&#91;9&#93; It is open to argument how stable the Tu-144S was at the listed airspeed. In any event, when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu-144D to a Tu-144LL standard, the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu-144LL "final approach speed... on the order of 360 ;km/h depending on fuel weight."&#91;10&#93; Brian Calvert, Concorde's technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights, cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287–296 ;km/h (178–184 ;mph; 155–160 ;kn).&#91;11&#93; The lower landing speed compared to Tu-144 is due to Concorde's more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise performance – a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well.&#91;12&#93;
Along with early Tu-134s, the Tu-144 was one of the last commercial aircraft with a braking parachute. The prototypes were also the only passenger jets ever fitted with ejection seats, albeit only for the crew and not the passengers.
SSTs for M2.2 had been designed in the Soviet Union before Tupolev was tasked with developing one. Design studies for the Myasischev SST had shown that a cruise specific fuel consumption (SFC) of not more than 1.2 ;kg/kgp hr would be required.&#91;5&#93; The only engine available in time with the required thrust and suitable for testing and perfecting the aircraft was the afterburning Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofan with a cruise SFC of 1.58 ;kg/kgp hr. Development of an alternative engine to meet the SFC requirement, a non-afterburning turbojet, the Kolesov RD-36-51A, began in 1964.&#91;5&#93; It took a long time for this engine to achieve acceptable SFC and reliability.&#91;7&#93;:p42 In the meantime the NK-144 high SFC gave a limited range of about 2,500 ;km (1,600 ;mi; 1,300 ;nmi), far less than Concorde. A maximum speed of 2,430 ;km/h (1,510 ;mph; 1,310 ;kn) (Mach 2.29) was reached with the afterburner.&#91;13&#93; Afterburners were added to Concorde to meet its take-off thrust requirement&#91;14&#93; and were not necessary for supersonic cruise; the Tu-144 used maximum afterburner for take-off and minimum for cruise.&#91;7&#93;:p110
The Tu-144S, of which nine were produced, was fitted with the Kuznetsov NK-144A turbofan to address lack of take-off thrust and surge margin. SFC at M2.0 was 1.81 ;kg/kgp hr. A further improvement, the NK-144V, achieved the required SFC, but too late to influence the decision to use the Kolesov RD-36-51.&#91;7&#93;:p135
The Tu-144D, of which five were produced (plus one uncompleted), was powered by the Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet with an SFC of 1.22 ;kg/kgp hr. The range with full payload increased to 5,330 ;km compared to 6,470 ;km for Concorde.&#91;7&#93;:p248 Plans for an aircraft with a range in excess of 7,000 ;km (4,300 ;mi; 3,800 ;nmi) range were never implemented.&#91;15&#93;
The engine intakes had variable ramps and bypass flaps with positions controlled automatically to suit the engine airflow.&#91;5&#93; They were very long to help prevent surging;&#91;7&#93;:p131 twice as long as those on Concorde. Jean Rech (Sud Aviation) states the need for excessive length was based on the misconception that length was required to attenuate inlet distortion.&#91;16&#93; The intakes were to be shortened by 10 feet on the projected Tu-144M.&#91;7&#93;:p178
The Kolesov RD-36-51 had an unusual variable con-di nozzle for the nozzle pressure ratios at supersonic speeds. Without an afterburner there was no variable nozzle already available. A translating plug nozzle was used.
Sixteen airworthy Tu-144 airplanes were built:
Although its last commercial passenger flight was in 1978, production of the Tu-144 did not cease until 1983, when construction of the airframe was stopped and left partially complete. The last production aircraft, Tu-144D number 77116, was not completed and was left derelict for many years on Voronezh East airfield. There was at least one ground test airframe for static testing in parallel with the development of prototype 68001.
The Tu-144S went into service on 26 December 1975, flying mail and freight between Moscow and Alma-Ata in preparation for passenger services, which commenced on 1 November 1977. The type certificate was issued by the USSR Gosaviaregister on 29 October 1977.&#91;17&#93;
The passenger service ran a semi-scheduled service until the first Tu-144D experienced an in-flight failure during a pre-delivery test flight, crash-landing on 23 May 1978 with two crew fatalities.&#91;18&#93; The Tu-144's 55th and last scheduled passenger flight occurred on 1 June 1978.
An Aeroflot freight-only service recommenced using the new production variant Tu-144D ("D" for Dal'nyaya – "long range")&#91;19&#93; aircraft on 23 June 1979, including longer routes from Moscow to Khabarovsk made possible by the more efficient Kolesov RD-36-51 turbojet engines, which also increased the maximum cruising speed to Mach 2.15.&#91;20&#93;
There were only 103 scheduled flights before the Tu-144 was removed from commercial service.
The Tu-144 programme was cancelled by a Soviet government decree on 1 July 1983 that also provided for future use of the remaining Tu-144 aircraft as airborne laboratories. In 1985, Tu-144D were used to train pilots for the Soviet Buran space shuttle. In 1986–1988 Tu-144D No. 77114, built in 1981, was used for medical and biological research of high-altitude atmosphere radiological conditions. Further research was planned but not completed, due to lack of funding.&#91;21&#93;
In the early 1990s, a wealthy businesswoman, Judith DePaul, and her company IBP Aerospace negotiated an agreement with Tupolev, NASA, Rockwell and later Boeing. They offered a Tu-144 as a testbed for its High Speed Commercial Research program, intended to design a second-generation supersonic jetliner called the High Speed Civil Transport. In 1995, Tu-144D No. 77114 (with only 82.5 hours of flight time) was taken out of storage and after extensive modification at a cost of US$350 ;million, designated the Tu-144LL (where LL is a Russian abbreviation for Flying Laboratory, Russian: Letayushchaya Laboratoriya, Летающая Лаборатория). The aircraft made 27 flights in Russia during 1996 and 1997.&#91;22&#93; Though regarded as a technical success, the project was cancelled for lack of funding in 1999.
This aircraft was reportedly sold in June 2001 for $11M via an on-line auction, but the aircraft sale did not proceed. Tejavia Systems, the company handling the transaction, reported in September 2003 that the deal was not signed as the replacement Kuznetsov NK-321 engines from a Tupolev Tu-160 bomber were military hardware and the Russian government would not allow them to be exported.&#91;23&#93;
In 2003, after the retirement of Concorde, there was renewed interest from several wealthy individuals who wanted to use the Tu-144LL for a transatlantic record attempt, despite the high cost of a flight readiness overhaul even if military authorities would authorize the use of NK-321 engines outside Russian Federation airspace.&#91;citation needed&#93;
The last two aircraft remain in Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky, Nos. 77114 (the Tu-144LL) and 77115. In March 2006, it was reported that both aircraft would be preserved,&#91;24&#93;&#91;unreliable source?&#93; with one erected on a pedestal near Zhukovsky City Council or above the Gromov Flight Research Institute entrance from Tupolev avenue.
Early flights in scheduled service indicated the Tu-144S was extremely unreliable. During 102 flights and 181 hours of freight and passenger flight time, the Tu-144S suffered more than 226 failures, 80 of them in flight. (The list was included in the Tu-144 service record provided by the USSR to British Aircraft Corporation-Aérospatiale in late 1978, when requesting Western technological aid with the Tu-144, and probably incomplete.)&#91;25&#93; Eighty of these failures were serious enough to cancel or delay the flight.
After the inaugural flight, two subsequent flights, during the next two weeks, were cancelled and the third flight rescheduled.&#91;26&#93; The official reason given by Aeroflot for cancellation was bad weather at Alma-Ata; however when the journalist called the Aeroflot office in Alma-Ata about local weather, the office said that the weather there was perfect and one aircraft had already arrived that morning. Failures included decompression of the cabin in flight on 27 December 1977, and engine-exhaust duct overheating causing the flight to be aborted and returned to the takeoff airport on 14 March 1978.&#91;25&#93;
Alexei Tupolev, Tu-144 chief designer, and two USSR vice-ministers (of aviation industry and of civil aviation) had to be personally present in Domodedovo airport before each scheduled Tu-144 departure to review the condition of the aircraft and make a joint decision on whether it could be released into flight.&#91;27&#93; Subsequently, flight cancellations became less common, as several Tu-144s were docked at Moscow's Domodedovo International Airport.&#91;citation needed&#93;
Tu-144 pilot Aleksandr Larin remembers a troublesome flight around 25 January 1978. The flight with passengers suffered the failure of 22 to 24 onboard systems. Seven to eight systems failed before takeoff, but given the large number of foreign TV and radio journalists and also other foreign notables aboard the flight, it was decided to proceed with the flight to avoid the embarrassment of cancellation.
After takeoff, failures continued to multiply. While the aircraft was supersonic en route to the destination airport, Tupolev bureau's crisis centre predicted that the front and left landing gear would not extend and that the aircraft would have to land on the right gear alone, at a landing speed of over 300 ;km/h (190 ;mph; 160 ;kn). Due to expected political fallout, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was personally notified of what was going on in the air.
With the accumulated failures, an alarm siren went off immediately after takeoff, with sound and volume similar to that of a civil defence warning. The crew could not figure a way to switch it off so the siren stayed on throughout the remaining 75 minutes of the flight. Eventually, the captain ordered the navigator to borrow a pillow from the passengers and stuff it inside the siren's horn. After all the suspense, all landing gear was extended and the aircraft was able to land.&#91;27&#93;
The final passenger flight of Tu-144 on around 30 May 1978 involved valve failure on one of the fuel tanks.&#91;27&#93;
Only one commercial route, Moscow to Alma-Ata (present-day Almaty), was ever used and flights were limited to one a week, despite there being eight Tu-144S certified aircraft available and a number of other routes suitable for supersonic flights, suggesting that the Soviet decision-makers had little confidence in the Tu-144 when passenger service began in 1977. Considering the high rate of technical failures their reasoning was sound. Bookings were limited to 70–80 passengers or fewer a flight, falling well below both the Tu-144's seating capacity and the demand for seats.&#91;28&#93; On its 55 scheduled flights, Tu-144s transported 3,194 passengers, an average of 58 passengers per flight. With officials acutely aware of the aircraft's poor reliability and fearful of possible crashes, Soviet decision-makers deliberately limited flight frequency to as few as would allow them to claim to be offering a regular service, and they also limited passenger load to minimize the impact and political fallout of a possible crash.&#91;citation needed&#93;
A serious problem was discovered when two Tu-144S airframes suffered structural failures during laboratory testing just prior to the Tu-144 entering passenger service.&#91;29&#93; Details are included in a chapter in Fridlyander's memoirs&#91;30&#93; and mentioned by Bliznyuk et al. The problem, discovered in 1976, may have been known prior to this testing; a large crack was discovered in the airframe of the prototype Tu-144 (aircraft 68001) during a stopover in Warsaw following its appearance at the 1971 Paris Air Show.&#91;31&#93;
The aircraft was assembled from parts machined from large blocks and panels, many over 19 ;m (62 ;ft) long and 0.64 to 1.27 ;m (2.1 to 4.2 ;ft) wide. While at the time, this approach was heralded as an advanced feature of the design, it turned out that large whole-moulded and machined parts contained defects in the alloy's structure that caused cracking at stress levels below that which the part was supposed to withstand. Once a crack started to develop, it spread quickly for many metres, with no crack-arresting design feature to stop it.&#91;29&#93; In 1976, during repeat-load and static testing at TsAGI (Russia's Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute), a Tu-144S airframe cracked at 70% of expected flight stress with cracks running many metres in both directions from their origin.&#91;21&#93;&#91;29&#93;
Later the same year, a test airframe was subjected to a test simulating the temperatures and pressures during a flight. The Tu-144 was placed in a hyperbaric chamber and heated to 130–150 ;°C (270–300 ;°F). Contraction and expansion happened because of the cooling during ascent and descent, heating during supersonic acceleration and cruise and because of the pressure change from high altitude (low outside pressure causing the airframe to expand) to ground-level pressure (causing it to contract). The airframe cracked in a similar way to that during TsAGI load testing.&#91;21&#93;&#91;29&#93;
While fatigue cracks of an acceptable length are normal in aircraft, they are usually found during routine inspections or stopped at a crack-arresting feature. Aircraft fly with acceptable cracks until they are repaired. The Tu-144 design was the opposite of standard practice, allowing a higher incidence of defects in the alloy structure, leading to crack formation and propagation to many metres.
The Soviet leadership made a political decision to enter the Tu-144 into passenger service in November 1977 despite receiving testing reports indicating that the Tu-144 airframe was unsafe and not airworthy for regular service. Aeroflot appears to have thought so little of the aircraft that it did not mention it in its five-year plan for 1976–1980. However, it was not the airline executives' decision and Aeroflot reluctantly put the Tu-144 into passenger service on 1 November 1977.
Though the decision to cancel the Tu-144S passenger service came a few days after the Tu-144D crashed during the test flight on 23 May 1978, this crash was regarded as the last straw over mounting concerns about the reliability of the Tu-144. Even the fact that the technical reason for the crash was specific to the Tu-144D fuel pump system and did not apply to the Tu-144S did not help. The decision to pull the Tu-144S out of passenger service after merely 55 flights is thus more likely to be attributable to high incidence of failures during and before the scheduled flights.
A problem for passengers was the very high level of noise inside the cabin, measured on average at least 90–95 ;dB.&#91;32&#93; The noise came from the engine; unlike Concorde, it could only sustain supersonic speeds using afterburners, like military aircraft. In addition, the unique active heat insulation system used for the air conditioning, which used a flow of spent cabin air, was described as excessively noisy. Passengers seated next to each other could have a conversation only with difficulty, and those seated two seats apart could not hear each other even when screaming and had to pass hand-written notes instead. Noise in the back of the aircraft was unbearable. Alexei Tupolev acknowledged the problem to foreign passengers and promised to fix it, but never had the means to do so.&#91;33&#93;&#91;N 1&#93;
There were unprecedented Soviet requests for Western technological aid with the development of the Tu-144. The request was made despite obviously not helping to foster Soviet technological prestige, which was one of the key purposes of the Tu-144 programme. In 1977, the USSR approached Lucas Industries, a designer of the engine control system for Concorde, requesting help with the design of the electronic management system of the Tu-144 engines, and also asked BAC-Aérospatiale for assistance in improving the Tu-144 air intakes. (The design of air intakes' variable geometry and their control system was one of the most intricate features of Concorde, contributing to its fuel efficiency. Over half of the wind-tunnel time during Concorde development was spent on the design of air intakes and their control system.) In late 1978, the USSR requested a wide range of Concorde technologies, evidently reflecting the broad spectrum of unresolved Tu-144 technical issues. The list included de-icing equipment for the leading edge of the air intakes, fuel-system pipes and devices to improve durability of these pipes, drain valves for fuel tanks, fireproof paints, navigation and piloting equipment, systems and techniques for acoustical loading of airframe and controls (to test against acoustic fatigue caused by high jet-noise environment), ways to reinforce the airframe to withstand damage, firefighting equipment, including warning devices and lightning protection, emergency power supply, and landing gear spray guards (a.k.a. water deflectors or "mud flaps" that increase engine efficiency when taking off from wet airstrips).&#91;N 2&#93; These requests were denied after the British government vetoed them on the ground that the same technologies, if transferred, could be also employed in Soviet bombers.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93; Soviet approaches were also reported in British mainstream press of the time, such as The Times.
On 31 August 1980, Tu-144D (77113) suffered an uncontained compressor disc failure in supersonic flight which damaged part of the airframe structure and systems. The crew was able to perform an emergency landing at Engels-2 strategic bomber base.&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; On 12 November 1981, a Tu-144D's RD-36-51 engine was destroyed during bench tests, leading to a temporary suspension of all Tu-144D flights.&#91;42&#93; One of the Tu-144Ds (77114, a.k.a. aircraft 101) suffered a crack across the bottom panel of its wing.&#91;43&#93;
Finally, the higher oil prices of the 1970s were starting to catch up with the Soviet Union. Much later than in the West, but since the late 1970s, commercial efficiency was starting to become a factor in aviation development decision-making even in the USSR.&#91;44&#93; The Tu-144 disappeared from Aeroflot published prospects, replaced by the Ilyushin Il-86, a jumbo jet that was to become the Soviet flagship airliner.
In the late 1970s, Soviet insiders were intensely hopeful in conversations with Western counterparts of reintroducing Tu-144 passenger service for the 1980 Moscow Olympic games, even perhaps for flights to Western Europe, given the aircraft's high visibility, but apparently the technical condition of the aircraft weighed against such re-introduction even for token flights.&#91;44&#93;
As discussed in Howard Moon's book Soviet SST (1989), economic efficiency alone would not have doomed the Tu-144 altogether; continuation of token flights for reasons of political prestige would have been possible, if only the aircraft itself would have allowed for it, but it did not.&#91;44&#93; The Tu-144 was to a large extent intended to be and trumpeted as a symbol of Soviet technological prestige and superiority.
The decision to cease Tu-144D production was issued on 7 January 1982, followed by a USSR government decree dated 1 July 1983 to cease the whole Tu-144 programme and to use produced Tu-144 aircraft as flying laboratories.&#91;21&#93;
In retrospect, it is apparent that the Tu-144 suffered from a rush in the design process to the detriment of thoroughness and quality, and this rush to get airborne exacted a heavy penalty later.&#91;45&#93; The rush is apparent even in outward timing: the 1963 government decree launching the Tu-144 programme defined that the Tu-144 should fly in 1968; it first flew on the last day of 1968 (31 December) to fulfill government goals set five years earlier. (By the way of comparison, Concorde's first flight was originally scheduled for February 1968, but was pushed back several times until March 1969 in order to iron out problems and test components more thoroughly).&#91;46&#93; Unlike Concorde development, the Tu-144 project was also strongly driven by ideologically and politically motivated haste of Soviet self-imposed racing against Concorde; Aleksei Poukhov, one of Tupolev's designers, reminiscences: "For the Soviet Union to allow the West to get ahead and leave it behind at that time was quite unthinkable. We not only had to prevent the West from getting ahead, but had to compete and leapfrog them, if necessary. This was the task Khrushchev set us... We knew that when Concorde's maiden flight had been set for February or March, 1969, we would have to get our aircraft up and flying by the end of 1968."&#91;N 3&#93;
The introduction of the Tu-144 into passenger service was timed to the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution, as was duly noted in Soviet officials' speeches delivered at the airport before the inaugural flight – whether the aircraft was actually ready for passenger service was deemed of secondary importance. Even the outward details of the inaugural Tu-144 flight betrayed the haste of its introduction into service: several ceiling panels were ajar, service trays stuck, window shades dropped without being pulled, reading lights did not work, not all toilets worked and a broken ramp delayed departure half an hour. On arrival to Alma-Ata, the Tu-144 was towed back and forth for 25 minutes before it could be aligned with the exit ramp.&#91;47&#93; Equally telling is the number of hours spent on flight testing. Whereas Concorde had been subjected to 5,000 hours of testing by the time it was certified for passenger flight, making it the most tested aircraft ever,&#91;48&#93; total flight testing time of the Tu-144 by the time of its introduction into passenger service was fewer than 800 hours. Flight testing time logged on the prototype (68001) was 180 hours;&#91;49&#93;&#91;50&#93; flight testing time for the Tu-144S until the completion of state acceptance tests was 408 hours;&#91;51&#93; service tests until the commencement of passenger service were 96 hours of flight time;&#91;52&#93; altogether totalling 756 hours. It is unclear why the Minister of Aviation Industry and the Minister of Civil Aviation did not endorse the protocols of state acceptance tests for four months after the tests completion.&#91;53&#93; One reason could be the change of the guard – Minister Dementiev, who was one of the chief backers of Tu-144, died a day before the tests completed – but it might also had something to do with aircraft reliability record uncovered during the tests that was no better than the subsequent dismal service record.
Fridlyander points out that in addition to the Tu-144, Tupolev's bureau had to work on other projects, including the Tu-154 passenger aircraft and the Tu-22M bomber. Despite large and high-priority resource investment in the Tu-144 development programme and the fact that a large part of the whole Soviet R&amp;D infrastructure was subordinated to the Tu-144 project, parallel project development overwhelmed the bureau causing it to lose focus and make design errors. (Design errors affected not only the Tu-144, but the Tu-154 as well).&#91;44&#93; The first batch of 120 Tu-154s suffered from wing destruction due to excessive structural load and had to be withdrawn.&#91;54&#93;
The rushed introduction to service of poorly tested aircraft happened previously with another Tupolev project that had high political visibility and prestige: the Tu-104 passenger jet-liner was the first successful Soviet passenger jet in service.  In a decision-making similar to the Tu-144-story, the Soviet government introduced the Tu-104 into passenger service before satisfactory stability and controllability had been achieved. During high-altitude and high-speed flight the aircraft was prone to longitudinal instability, and also at high altitudes, it had a narrow range of angle of attack separating the aircraft from stalls known as coffin corner. These problems created the preconditions for spin dives, that happened twice before the Tu-104 was eventually properly tested and the problem was resolved.&#91;55&#93;
This politically motivated rush, along with the fact that the project was essentially ideologically motivated rather than driven by intrinsic needs of the Soviet society, and with general technological insufficiencies of Soviet industrial base, contributed to the final undoing of the Tu-144 project. (Alexander Poukhov, one of the Tu-144 design engineers who subsequently rose to be one of the bureau's senior designers, estimated in 1998 that the Tu-144 project was 10–15 years beyond the USSR's capabilities at that time).&#91;N 4&#93;
Moon suggests that subordination of available Soviet R&amp;D resource allocation to the Tu-144 programme significantly slowed down the development of other Soviet aircraft projects, such as the Il-86 wide-body jet, and stagnated Soviet aviation development for almost a decade.&#91;44&#93;
After ceasing the Tu-144 programme, Tu-144D No. 77114 (aircraft 101 or 08-2) carried out test flights between the 13–20 July 1983 to establish 13 world records registered with the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).&#91;57&#93;&#91;58&#93; These records established an altitude of 18,200 metres (59,700 ;ft) with a range of loads up to 30 tonnes, and a sustained speed of 2,032 ;km/h (1,263 ;mph; 1,097 ;kn) over a closed circuit of up to 2,000 ;km (1,200 ;mi; 1,100 ;nmi) with similar loads.
To put the numbers in perspective, Concorde's service ceiling under a typical Transatlantic flight payload of 10 tonnes is 18,290 ;m (60,000 ;ft),&#91;N 5&#93; and this is higher than the record set by the Tu-144D.  According to unverified sources, during a 26 March 1974 test flight a Concorde reached its maximum speed ever of 2,370 ;km/h (1,470 ;mph; 1,280 ;kn) (Mach 2.23) at an altitude of 19,415 ;m (63,700 ;ft), and during subsequent test flights reached maximum altitude of 20,700 ;m (67,900 ;ft). It is unclear why Tu-144D's maximum achievable altitude would be lower than Concorde's even regular flight altitude, given that Tupolev's data claim better lift-to-drag ratio for the Tu-144 (over 8.0 for Tu-144D vs Concorde's 7.3–7.7 at Mach 2.x) and the thrust of the Tu-144D's RD-36-51 engines is higher than Concorde's Olympus 593 engines.&#91;21&#93;
Concorde was originally designed for cruising speeds up to Mach 2.2, but its regular service speed was limited to Mach 2.02 to reduce fuel consumption, extend airframe life and provide a higher safety margin. One of Tupolev's web site pages states that "TU-144 and TU-160 aircraft operation has demonstrated expediency of limitation of cruise supersonic speed of M=2.0 to provide structure service life and to limit cruising altitude".&#91;60&#93;
The aircraft was designed for a 30,000-hour service life over 15 years. Airframe heating and the high temperature properties of the primary structural materials, which were aluminum alloys, set the maximum speed at Mach 2.2.&#91;7&#93;:p.49 15% by weight was titanium and 23% non-metallic materials. Titanium or stainless steel were used for the leading edges, elevons, rudder and the rear fuselage engine-exhaust heat shield.&#91;61&#93;
A project study, assigned the number Tu-144DA, increased the wing area and the take-off weight, and replaced the engines with the RD-36-61 which had 5% more thrust. The Tu-144DA increased fuel capacity from 98,000 ;kg to 125,000 ;kg with a higher maximum certified take-off weight (MCTOW) of 235,000 ;kg. and range up to 7,500 ;km.&#91;5&#93;
Early configurations of the Tu-144 were based on the unbuilt Tupolev Tu-135 bomber, retaining the latter aircraft's canard layout, wings and nacelles. Deriving from the Tu-135 bomber, early Tupolev's design for supersonic passenger airplane was code-named Tu-135P before acquiring the Tu-144 project code.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93;
Over the course of the Tu-144 project, the Tupolev bureau created designs of a number of military versions of Tu-144 but none were ever built. In the early 1970s, Tupolev was developing the Tu-144R intended to carry and air-launch up to three solid-fueled ICBMs. The launch was to be performed from within Soviet air space, with the aircraft accelerating to its maximum speed before releasing the missiles. The original design was based on the Tu-144S, but later changed to be derived from the Tu-144D. Another version of the design was to carry air-launched long-range cruise missiles similar to the Kh-55. The study of this version envisioned the use of liquid hydrogen for the afterburners.
In the late 1970s. Tupolev contemplated the development of a long-range heavy interceptor (DP-2) based on the Tu-144D also able to escort bombers on long-range missions. Later this project evolved into an aircraft for electronic countermeasures (ECM) to suppress enemy radars and facilitate bomber's penetration through enemy air defenses (Tu-144PP). In the early 1980s this functionality was supplanted with theatre and strategic reconnaissance (Tu-144PR).
The dimmer civil prospects for Tu-144 were becoming apparent the more Tupolev tried to "sell" the aircraft to the military. One of the last attempts to sell a military version of the Tu-144 was the Tu-144MR, a project for a long-range reconnaissance aircraft for the Soviet Navy intended to provide targeting information to the Navy's ships and submarines on sea and oceanic theaters of operations. Another proposed navy version was to have a strike capability (two Kh-45 air-to-surface cruise missiles), along with a reconnaissance function.&#91;66&#93; The Tu-144MR was also to have served as a carrier aircraft for the Tupolev Voron reconnaissance drone, designed to compete with the Lockheed D-21 and influenced by it, but the project never materialised.&#91;67&#93;
The military was unreceptive to Tupolev's approaches.  Vasily Reshetnikov, the commander of Soviet strategic aviation and subsequently, a vice-commander of the Soviet Air Force, remembers how, in 1972, he was dismayed by Tupolev's attempts to offer for military use the aircraft that "fell short of its performance target, was beset by reliability problems, fuel-thirsty and difficult to operate".&#91;68&#93;
Reshetnikov goes on to remember:
While several Tu-144s were donated to museums in Moscow Monino, Samara and Ulyanovsk, at least two Tu-144D remained in open storage in Moscow Zhukovsky.
As of June 2010, two aircraft (tail numbers 77114 and 77115) are located outdoors at LII aircraft testing facility, Zhukovsky (at coordinates 55°34′11″N 38°09′20″E&#xfeff; / &#xfeff;55.569786°N 38.155652°E&#xfeff; / 55.569786; 38.155652 and 55°34′18″N 38°09′08″E&#xfeff; / &#xfeff;55.571776°N 38.152304°E&#xfeff; / 55.571776; 38.152304). Previously, they were constantly on display at MAKS Airshows. Tail number 77115 was bought in 2005 by the Heros Club of Zhukovsky and still on display at MAKS as of 2019.&#91;72&#93; In 2019, tail number 77114 was repainted in Aeroflot livery and put on display outside of Zhukovsky International Airport.
Tu-144S, tail number 77106, is on display at Central Air Force Museum of Russia in Monino. Maiden flight was on 4 March 1975, the final one on 29 February 1980. The aircraft was used to assess the effectiveness of the air-conditioning systems and to solve some problems on the fuel system. It can be considered the first production aircraft, being the first to be equipped for commercial use and delivered to Aeroflot.  The first operational flight was on 26 December 1975 between Moscow and Alma-Ata carrying cargo and mail.  This aircraft was the first SST to land on a dirty runway when she was retired to Monino.&#91;73&#93;
Another Tu-144, tail number 77107, is on open display in Kazan and located at 55°49′18″N 49°08′06″E&#xfeff; / &#xfeff;55.821714°N 49.135064°E&#xfeff; / 55.821714; 49.135064. The aircraft was constructed in 1975 and was a production model intended for passenger use. However, it was only used during test flights. On 29 March 1976 it made its last flight to Kazan. This aircraft was put on sale on eBay in 2017.&#91;74&#93;&#91;75&#93;
TU-144S, tail number 77108, is on display in the museum of Samara State Aerospace University (53°14′25″N 50°21′51″E&#xfeff; / &#xfeff;53.240367°N 50.364092°E&#xfeff; / 53.240367; 50.364092). It made its maiden flight on 12 December 1975, and its final flight on 27 August 1987. Development works on navigation system were made in this aircraft as well as flight-director approach.&#91;76&#93;
The only Tu-144 on display outside the former Soviet Union, tail number 77112, was acquired by the Auto &amp; Technikmuseum Sinsheim in Germany, where it was shipped – not flown – in 2001 and where it now stands, in its original Aeroflot livery, on display next to an Air France Concorde.&#91;78&#93; As of 2017, the Technikmuseum Sinsheim remains the only museum in the world where the Tu-144 and Concorde are on display together.
At the Paris Air Show on 3 June 1973, the development program of the Tu-144 suffered severely when the first Tu-144S production airliner (reg 77102) crashed.&#91;79&#93;
At the end of the officially-approved demonstration flight, which was an exact repeat of the previous day's display, instead of landing as expected the aircraft entered a very steep climb before making a violent downwards manoeuvre.&#91;7&#93;:228 As it tried to recover the aircraft broke apart and crashed, destroying 15 houses and killing all six people on board the Tu-144 and eight more on the ground.
Gordon et al.&#91;7&#93; state that the flight crew had departed from the approved flight profile for the display, a serious offense in itself. They were under instructions to outperform the Concorde display by all means. During the unapproved, and therefore unrehearsed manoeuvres, the stability and control augmentation system was not operating normally. If it had been it would have prevented the loads that caused the port wing to fail.
A popular Russian theory for the crash was that the Tu-144 tried to avoid a French Mirage chase-plane that was attempting to photograph its canards, which were very advanced for the time, and the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other, to cover up such details. The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in industrial espionage. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Russian crew was not told about the Mirage's flight) though not its role in the crash. The official press release did state: "though the inquiry established that there was no real risk of collision between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised."&#91;80&#93;
Another theory relates to deliberate misinformation on the part of the Anglo-French design-team. The main point of this theory being the Anglo-French team knew the Soviet team was planning to steal the design plans of Concorde, and the Soviets were allegedly passed ersatz (substituted) blueprints with a flawed design. The case, it is claimed, contributed to the imprisonment by the Soviets of Greville Wynne in 1963 for spying.&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93; Wynne was imprisoned on 11 May 1963 and the development of the Tu-144 was not sanctioned until 16 July 1963.
General characteristics
Performance

The 1973 Paris Air Show Tu-144 crash was the crash of the second production Tupolev Tu-144 at Goussainville, Val-d'Oise, France, which killed all six crew and eight people on the ground.&#91;1&#93;&#91;2&#93; The crash, at the Paris Air Show on Sunday, 3 June 1973,&#91;3&#93; damaged the development program of the Tupolev Tu-144.&#91;4&#93;
One theory is that a French Mirage jet sent to photograph the aircraft without the knowledge of the Soviet crew caused the pilots to take evasive manoeuvres, resulting in the crash.&#91;5&#93; Another theory is that in a rivalry with the Anglo-French Concorde, the pilots attempted a manoeuvre that was beyond the capabilities of the aircraft.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;
The aircraft involved was Tupolev Tu-144S CCCP-77102, manufacturer's serial number 01–2, the second production Tu-144.&#91;7&#93; The aircraft had first flown on 29 March 1972.&#91;8&#93; This aircraft had been modified compared to the initial prototype to include landing gear that retracted into the nacelles, and retractable canards.&#91;9&#93; The pilot was Mikhail Kozlov,&#91;6&#93; and the co-pilot was Valery M. Molchanov.&#91;10&#93; Also on board were G. N. Bazhenov, the flight navigator, V. N. Benderov, deputy chief designer and engineer major-general, B. A. Pervukhin, senior engineer, and A. I. Dralin, flight engineer.&#91;11&#93; The crash occurred in front of 250,000 people, including designer Alexei Tupolev, towards the end of the show.&#91;6&#93;
During the show, there was a "fierce competition between the Anglo-French Concorde and the Russian Tu-144".&#91;6&#93; The Soviet pilot, Mikhail Kozlov, had bragged that he would outperform the Concorde.&#91;6&#93;  "Just wait until you see us fly," he was quoted as saying. "Then you'll see something."&#91;12&#93; On the final day of the show, the Concorde, which was not yet in production, performed its demonstration flight first.&#91;6&#93; Its performance was later described as being unexciting, and it has been theorized that Kozlov was determined to show how much better his aircraft was.&#91;12&#93;
Once in flight, the aircraft made what appeared to be a landing approach, with the landing gear out and the "moustache" canards extended, but then with all four engines full power, climbed rapidly. Possibly stalling below 2,000 ;ft (610 ;m), the aircraft pitched over and went into a steep dive.&#91;6&#93; Trying to pull out of the subsequent dive with the engines again at full power, the Tu-144 broke up in mid-air, possibly due to overstressing the airframe. The left wing came away first, and then the aircraft disintegrated and crashed,&#91;6&#93;&#91;8&#93;&#91;10&#93; destroying 15 houses,&#91;13&#93; and killing all six people on board the Tu-144 and eight more on the ground.&#91;8&#93; Three children were among those killed, and 60 people received severe injuries.&#91;14&#93;
The crew of the Tu-144 were buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow on 12 June 1973.&#91;15&#93;
Following the crash, Marcel Dassault called for the 1975 Paris Air Show to be held at Istres, which is situated in open country 40 ;km (25 ;mi) north west of Marseille.&#91;16&#93;
The crash reduced the enthusiasm of Aeroflot for the Tu-144. Restrictions on the Tu-144 following the Paris Air Show crash meant that it only saw limited service during 1977 and 1978, and it was finally withdrawn following another crash in May 1978.&#91;7&#93; The Tu-144's rival, the Concorde, went on to serve with British Airways and Air France for 30 years afterwards, being finally withdrawn from service in 2003 due to low passenger numbers following the crash of Flight 4590, rising service costs and the slump in the aviation industry following 9/11.&#91;17&#93;
The accident was investigated by the DTCE, part of the French military, which was responsible for accidents involving prototype aircraft in France. The wreckage was recovered to a hangar at Le Bourget, with some of it being flown by an Antonov An-22 to the Soviet Union.&#91;10&#93;
One theory is that the Tu-144 manoeuvred to avoid a French Mirage chase plane that was attempting to photograph its unique canards,&#91;18&#93; which were advanced for the time, and that the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other to cover up such details.&#91;14&#93; The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in industrial espionage. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Soviet crew were not told about the Mirage's flight) though not its role in the crash. However, the official press release did state: "though the inquiry established that there was no real risk of collision between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised."&#91;14&#93; Howard Moon, author of Soviet SST: The Techno-Politics Of The Tupolev-144, stresses that last-minute changes to the flight schedule would have disoriented the pilots in a cockpit with notably poor sightlines. He also cites an eyewitness who claims the co-pilot had agreed to take a camera with him, which he may have been operating at the time of the evasive manoeuvre.&#91;14&#93; The initial approach may have been an attempted landing on the wrong runway, which occurred due to a last-minute shortening of the Tu-144's display.&#91;5&#93;
Bob Hoover, a pilot on the supersonic Bell X-1 program, believed that the rivalry of the Tu-144 and Concorde led the pilot of the Tu-144 to attempt a manoeuvre that went beyond the abilities of the aircraft: "That day, the Concorde went first, and after the pilot performed a high-speed flyby, he pulled up steeply and climbed to approximately 10,000 [feet] before leveling off. When the Tu-144 pilot performed the same manoeuvre he pulled the nose up so steeply l didn't believe he could possibly recover."&#91;5&#93;
Another theory claims that there was deliberate misinformation on the part of the Anglo-French design-team. The main thrust of this theory was that the Anglo-French team knew that the Soviet team was planning to steal the design plans of the Concorde, and the Soviets were allegedly passed false blueprints with a flawed design. The case, it is claimed, contributed to the imprisonment by the Soviets of Greville Wynne in 1963 for spying.&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93;&#91;failed verification&#93; Wynne was imprisoned on 11 May 1963 and the development of the Tu-144 was not sanctioned until 16 July.

Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani (died 3 June 1511) was a Maliki scholar of Islamic law, active in North Africa (modern day Algeria and Morocco) from the end of the fifteenth century until his death. He was identified as the author of the 1504 fatwa commonly named the Oran fatwa, instructing the Muslims in Spain about how to secretly practice Islam, and granting comprehensive dispensations for them to publicly conform to Christianity and performing acts normally forbidden in Islam when necessary to survive.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; Because of his authorship of the fatwa he is often referred to as "the Mufti of Oran", although he likely issued the fatwa in Fez, not in Oran and he did not have any official capacity in either city.&#91;5&#93;
His name was given in various forms and rendition, both by surviving manuscripts of his works and by modern scholars. &#91;6&#93; His full name is made up of several names:
In some of the manuscripts the name "Ubaydallah" is also added, a theophoric name that means "the little servant of God", and was likely added as a pious formula.&#91;8&#93;
His various names, and the various renditions and combinations that appear in various manuscripts and transliterations, have given rise to occasional confusions.&#91;6&#93; The renditions that appeared include: "Ahmed ben Juma'a", "Ubaydallah Ahmed Ben Bu Jumu'ah", "Ahmad fijo de Abu Jumu'ah", "Obaydala Ahmed Abenabigiomoa", "Ubayd Allah al-Wahrani" and "Ahmad Bu Jum'a". &#91;11&#93;&#91;12&#93;
There are several contradicting theories about his birth and childhood.&#91;9&#93; He may have been born in Oran, then part of the Zayyanid kingdom of Tlemcen,&#91;13&#93; or in the nearby region of Maghrawah.&#91;14&#93; In either way, he was presumably of Berber origin and belonged to the Maghrawah tribal confederation.&#91;1&#93; Some opinions also say that he was a native of Spain, born in Almagro.&#91;9&#93; His date of birth is unknown, but estimated to be in the mid-fifteenth century.&#91;1&#93;
He studied in Oran in his early years, then moved to Tlemcen, the nearest major capital to get an education in Islamic law and theology.&#91;1&#93; He studied under Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Sanusi, a well-known Islamic scholar.&#91;1&#93; In Tlemcen he wrote Jami' Jawami' al-Ikhtisar wa al-Tibyan and had a teaching position.&#91;1&#93; At some point (estimated to be around 1493), he moved to Fez and obtained a salaried position as a professor of law.&#91;1&#93; He issued the Oran fatwa in 1504, likely when he was in Fez.&#91;15&#93; He died in Fez in 3 June 1511.&#91;2&#93;&#91;16&#93; His son, Muhammad Shaqrun would also become an Islamic scholar.&#91;17&#93;
Because of his authorship of the Oran fatwa, he has frequently been referred to as "the Mufti of Oran", suggesting that he wrote the fatwa there and he had some sort of official authority as a mufti.&#91;18&#93; However, Devin J. Stewart noted that he was active in Fez (in today's Morocco), not Oran, at the time of the fatwa's composition, and likely penned it there.&#91;15&#93; His name did not appear in the list of official muftis of Fez,&#91;15&#93; so it is likely that the fatwa was not issued in any official capacity, but as a private mufti issuing a legal opinion on request.&#91;15&#93;&#91;19&#93; In theory, any competent Islamic jurist could issue a fatwa, although normally it carries less weight than ones from an official mufti.&#91;20&#93;
He is best known for the responsum fatwa commonly named by modern scholar as the Oran fatwa.&#91;21&#93;&#91;4&#93; The name "Oran fatwa" itself was given by modern scholars due to the name al-Wahrani ("of Oran") that appeared in the text as part of his name.&#91;18&#93; The fatwa instructed the Muslims in Spain about how to secretly practice Islam, and granted comprehensive dispensations for them to publicly conform to Christianity and perform acts normally forbidden in Islam when necessary to survive.&#91;4&#93;&#91;21&#93; The fatwa, while reaffirming the orthodox obligation of all Muslims, sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia requirements for the benefit of the persecuted Muslims of Spain. The fatwa allowed for outwardly conforming to Christianity and performing acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law when necessary to survive, while maintaining internal convictions against such acts.&#91;22&#93;
The fatwa enjoyed wide currency among Muslims and Moriscos (Muslims nominally converted to Christianity and their descendants) in Spain, and one of the surviving aljamiado translations was dated at 1564, 60 years after the original fatwa.&#91;23&#93; The fatwa has been described as the "key theological document" to understand the practice of Spanish Muslims following the Reconquista up to the expulsion of the Moriscos.&#91;22&#93;
He wrote Jami' Jawami' al-Ikhtisar wa al-Tibyan fima ya'rudu bayna al-mu'allimin wa aba al-sibyan ("The Epitome of Epitomes of Competence and Explanation, on What Arises Between Teachers and the Fathers of Boys"), a treatise on elementary education while in Tlemcen.&#91;24&#93;

Thomas Hutchinson (9 September 1711 &#8211; 3 June 1780) was a businessman, historian, and a prominent Loyalist politician of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the years before the American Revolution. He has been referred to as "the most important figure on the loyalist side in pre-Revolutionary Massachusetts."&#91;1&#93;   He was a successful merchant and politician, and was active at high levels of the Massachusetts government for many years, serving as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1758 to 1774.  He was a politically polarizing figure who came to be identified by John Adams and Samuel Adams as a proponent of hated British taxes, despite his initial opposition to Parliamentary tax laws directed at the colonies. He was blamed by Lord North (the British Prime Minister at the time) for being a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.&#91;2&#93;
Hutchinson's Boston mansion was ransacked in 1765 during protests against the Stamp Act, damaging his collection of materials on early Massachusetts history. As acting governor in 1770, he exposed himself to mob attack in the aftermath of the Boston massacre, after which he ordered the removal of troops from Boston to Castle William. Letters of his calling for abridgement of colonial rights were published in 1773, further intensifying dislike of him in the colony. He was replaced as governor in May 1774 by General Thomas Gage, and went into exile in England, where he advised the government on how to deal with the colonists.
Hutchinson had a deep interest in colonial history, collecting many historical documents. He wrote a three-volume History of the Province of Massachusetts Bay whose last volume, published posthumously, covered his own period in office. Historian Bernard Bailyn wrote of Hutchinson, "If there was one person in America whose actions might have altered the outcome [of the protests and disputes preceding the American Revolutionary War], it was he."&#91;3&#93; Scholars use Hutchinson's career to represent the tragic fate of the many Loyalists marginalized by their attachment to an outmoded imperial structure at a time when the modern nation-state was emerging. Hutchinson exemplifies the difficulties experienced by Loyalists, paralyzed by his ideology and his dual loyalties to America and Britain. He sacrificed his love for Massachusetts to his loyalty to Great Britain, where he spent his last years in unhappy exile.&#91;4&#93;
Thomas Hutchinson was born on 9 September 1711 in the North End of Boston, the fourth of twelve children of Thomas and Sarah Foster Hutchinson.&#91;5&#93;  He was descended from early New England settlers, including Anne Hutchinson and her son Edward Hutchinson, and his parents were both from well-to-do merchant families. His father was involved in the family mercantile trade but was also active in political, military, and charitable circles and served on the provincial council.&#91;6&#93;  His younger brother was Foster Hutchinson.
Young Thomas entered Harvard College at twelve, graduating in 1727.&#91;7&#93;  His father introduced him to the business world early, and he displayed remarkable business acumen. According to his autobiographical sketch of his childhood, Hutchinson turned a modest gift from his father of "five quintals of fish" into between £400 and £500 by the time he was 21.&#91;8&#93; In 1732, he received some exposure to politics when he accompanied Governor Jonathan Belcher on a voyage to Casco Bay for negotiations with the Abenaki of Maine, then part of Massachusetts.  The voyage was made in a vessel of which Hutchinson was part owner.&#91;9&#93;  In 1734, he married Margaret Sanford, a granddaughter of Rhode Island Governor Peleg Sanford.  The Sanford and Hutchinson families had a long history of business and personal connections; Margaret, in fact, was a distant relative.&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93; The marriage secured a political alliance between Hutchinson and Andrew and Peter Oliver which lasted long after Margaret's death. Margaret Sanford's sister Mary (1713-1773) was the second wife of Andrew Oliver. Likewise, a daughter of Thomas Hutchinson married a son of Peter Oliver. The Oliver brothers were also related to Massachusetts governor Jonathan Belcher and to New Hampshire lieutenant governors William Partridge and George Vaughan (Harvard Class of 1696). The couple had twelve children, only five of whom survived to adulthood, before Margaret died in 1754 from complications of childbirth.&#91;12&#93;
In 1737 Hutchinson entered politics, being elected as a Boston selectman, and later in the year, to a seat in the General Court (the provincial assembly).&#91;13&#93;  He spoke out against the province's practice of issuing bills of credit (as a form of paper currency), whose inflationary drop in value wrought havoc in the economy.  This position was unpopular with the populist party in the province, and Hutchinson was voted out in the 1739 election.&#91;14&#93;  He was sent to England as an agent to plead on behalf of property owners affected by King George II's decision concerning the boundary line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire which significantly favored New Hampshire.  Hutchinson's embassy was unsuccessful, although he returned with a bequest to Harvard for the construction of a new chapel; Holden Chapel, built with these funds, still stands today.&#91;15&#93;
In 1742, Hutchinson was again elected to the General Court, where he served until 1749, being the body's speaker from 1746 to 1749.&#91;16&#93;  His continued advocacy of currency reforms so annoyed the populist faction that the need to guard his properties in Boston and Milton from possible mob action was discussed.&#91;17&#93;  When the British government was convinced to refund the province's expense for mounting the 1745 Louisbourg expedition, Hutchinson seized upon the idea of using the massive payment (about £180,000 in gold and silver) to retire the province's paper currency. Despite significant opposition, Hutchinson successfully navigated a bill implementing the idea through the assembly's general court in 1749; it received the agreement of the Governor's Council, and also the signature of Governor William Shirley.  Many of the bill's opponents were pleasantly surprised when the exchange of paper for specie did not cause any financial shocks, and Hutchinson's popularity soared.&#91;18&#93;
Despite the success, Hutchinson was voted out of the assembly in 1749.  He was, however, immediately appointed to the Governor's Council.&#91;19&#93; In 1749 he headed a commission to arrange a treaty with the Indians in the District of Maine,&#91;20&#93; which was then part of Massachusetts, and he served on boundary commissions to settle disputes with Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1752 he was appointed judge of probate and a justice of the Common Pleas. Following the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, he was a delegate to the Albany Convention.  In that meeting he took a leading part in the discussions, working with Benjamin Franklin to draft a plan for colonial union.  Hutchinson agreed with Franklin that the present disunity endangered the British colonies, and that decisive action must be taken to knit the too-often-competing colonies into a coherent whole. Most important, the report drafted by Hutchinson concluded that the colonies must be encouraged to establish "a Union of His Majesty's several governments on the continent, that so their councils, treasure, and strength may be employed in due proportion against their common enemy".&#91;21&#93;
Hutchinson's wife died quite suddenly in 1754; Hutchinson thereafter threw himself into his work.&#91;22&#93; His work was not entirely of a political nature: in a humanitarian streak he supported Acadian refugees who had been expelled from their Nova Scotia homelands, even though this support of Roman Catholics did not gain him friends in Protestant Massachusetts.  He was also sensitive to the needs of the military men involved in the war, often giving aid to needy families of veterans.&#91;23&#93;
When Governor Shirley's political opponents engineered his recall in 1756, Hutchinson sought and received the endorsement of the British military leader Lord Loudoun in an effort to succeed Shirley as governor. During this time Hutchinson was the leading politician in the province due to the age and infirmity of Lieutenant Governor Spencer Phips.&#91;24&#93; Hutchinson's application was unsuccessful, but he did receive an appointment as lieutenant governor in 1758, serving under Thomas Pownall. Hutchinson's relationship with Pownall was awkward, for Pownall was at the center of political activities that dislodged Governor Shirley, under whose patronage Hutchinson had risen in power and influence.  Pownall cultivated relations with the populist factions in the state, and sought to remove the influence of Shirley supporters, sometimes asking Hutchinson to turn against people he (Hutchinson) had earlier supported.  This Hutchinson refused to do, since he saw these actions as harming the province's stability and taking place at "the caprice of the governor".&#91;25&#93;  Pownall, whose mistrust of Hutchinson was reciprocated, requested to leave to return to England in late 1759. The political opposition of Shirley supporters and the death of some of his leading populist supporters may have contributed to this decision.&#91;26&#93;  He departed the province on 3 June 1760, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.&#91;27&#93;  Several months later Pownall's replacement, Francis Bernard, arrived to take the reins of power.&#91;28&#93;
One of Bernard's early acts was the appointment of Hutchinson instead of James Otis Sr., as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature.  This action by itself turned the province's populists, whose vocal leaders included Otis and his son James Jr., against both Hutchinson and Bernard, with long term consequences to Hutchinson's reputation. Hutchinson, with no legal training, had not sought the post, and some emerging legal thinkers, notably a rising young lawyer named John Adams, were also outraged.&#91;29&#93;
In 1761 Hutchinson brought upon himself a storm of protest and criticism by issuing writs of assistance, documents that authorised essentially arbitrary searches by customs officials.  Although some had been issued (ironically over Hutchinson's objections) in earlier years, the writs he authorised were in some cases renewals of existing writs necessitated by the accession of King George III to the throne.  Adams and the Otises seized on the issue to rail against his monopolisation of power (since he was also a lieutenant governor and sat on the council) and lack of legal qualifications for the post of chief justice.&#91;30&#93;
When the Sugar Act was being discussed in Parliament in 1763, proposals were put forward to send Hutchinson to England to represent the colony's opposition to the proposal. Governor Bernard, however, objected to sending the sitting lieutenant governor, and the bill was enacted. Much colonial protest followed, and Hutchinson was in agreement with vocal opponents like the Otises (who around this time began using the phrase "no taxation without representation") that the law harmed the Massachusetts economy.&#91;31&#93;  In the ensuing debates, however, differences emerged between Hutchinson and others over Parliament's supremacy and the feasibility of having formal colonial representation there,&#91;32&#93; which were exacerbated by the personal animosity that had developed between Hutchinson and the Otises.  Led by James Otis, Jr. and Oxenbridge Thacher, the anti-Parliament faction seized on every minor dispute to rail against Hutchinson and his faction's monopolisation of power. Hutchinson was at first dismissive of these ongoing political attacks, believing that his opponents were either misguided or misled.  Biographer Andrew Walmsley observes that Hutchinson at this stage seriously underestimated the impact of these attacks in building a coherent opposition to crown control, and in the damage it was doing to his own reputation.&#91;33&#93;
In debates leading up to the passage of the 1765 Stamp Act, both Hutchinson and Bernard quietly warned London not to proceed.  Hutchinson in particular wrote that "It cannot be good to tax the Americans ... You will lose more than you gain."&#91;34&#93; Hutchinson's letters even shaped the political discourse in Parliament. Isaac Barre, a prominent Member of Parliament, drew heavily on the themes presented in Hutchinson's letters: he proclaimed that "Your oppressions planted them. . . . They grew by your neglect. . . . They have nobly taken up arms in your defense" on the floor of Parliament in opposition to the Stamp Act.&#91;citation needed&#93; When the assembly met to draft a petition to London on the matter in October 1764, Hutchinson opposed the inclusion of the radicals' language, and eventually pushed through a more moderate statement of opposition.  However, the Massachusetts petition was seen as weak in comparison to those prepared by other colonies, and Hutchinson was claimed to be secretly seeking to promote the Stamp Act.  He was also accused of "treachery" and "betraying his country".&#91;35&#93;  News of the act's passage propelled one of the most vocal opponents of Parliamentary supremacy, Samuel Adams, into a larger role in provincial politics.&#91;36&#93;  Hutchinson privately supported calls for its repeal, but his unwillingness to publicly oppose the act merely provided additional fuel for his opponents.&#91;37&#93;
Hutchinson's brother-in-law, colonial secretary Andrew Oliver, was given the job of "stamp master", with responsibility for implementing the act in the province. Although Hutchinson apparently had no hand in this assignment, his opponents were quick to accuse him of further duplicity.&#91;38&#93;  His attempts to explain his position only fuelled the opposition, who recounted his early unpopular acts and questioned his motives in those deeds.&#91;39&#93;  On 13 August 1765, mobs descended on Oliver's home and office, ransacking both.  The next night Hutchinson's Boston mansion was surrounded, and the crowd demanded that he formally deny arguing in favour of the Stamp Act in his correspondence with London. He refused, and only the intervention of a moderate leader prevented any action that night.&#91;40&#93;
Twelve days later, on the evening of 26 August, a mob again formed outside of his mansion, and this time they would not be denied.  Described by one architectural historian as "the first developed example of provincial Palladianism in New England,"&#91;41&#93; the house was broken into (Hutchinson and his family narrowly escaping), and systematically ransacked.  The house finishings (wainscoting and other decorative woodwork) were effectively destroyed, and even the building's cupola was taken down in violence that lasted the entire night.  The family silver, furniture, and other items were stolen or destroyed (although some items were eventually returned), and Hutchinson's collection of historically important manuscripts was scattered. Hutchinson was then working on the final volume of his three volume history of the Massachusetts Bay colony. Many pages of the work were lost that night and had to be recreated.&#91;42&#93; Hutchinson's detailed inventory (reprinted by biographer James Kendall Hosmer) valued the damage done at more than £2,200, and he eventually received over £3,100 from the province for his troubles.&#91;43&#93;  Hutchinson and his family temporarily took refuge at Castle William,&#91;44&#93; and thereafter took up primary residence at Hutchinson's estate in Milton.&#91;45&#93;
Because of the controversy over the Stamp Act, the radical faction came to control both the assembly and the governor's council in 1766, and Hutchinson was denied a seat on the governor's council.&#91;46&#93;  Amid increased furor after the passage of the 1767 Townshend Acts, Governor Bernard requested and received British Army troops to protect crown officials.  Letters written by Bernard describing conditions in the province were acquired by the radical opposition and published, leading to his recall. Bernard left for England on 1 August 1769, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.&#91;47&#93;  Hutchinson was unsuccessful in his attempts to distance himself from the unpopular Bernard administration, and he continued to be attacked in the assembly and the local press.&#91;48&#93;  Despite this, he continued to lobby for a formal appointment as governor.  He categorically refused to again serve as lieutenant governor under another governor, preferring instead a posting elsewhere, or to resign the lieutenant governorship.&#91;49&#93;
Hutchinson was still acting governor when protests over the Townshend taxes erupted into the Boston Massacre on 5 March 1770, when British soldiers fired into a crowd, killing five people.&#91;50&#93;  Hutchinson went to the scene in the aftermath of the shooting, and promised that justice would be applied fairly. He had all of the British soldiers involved in the incident arrested the next day, but ongoing unrest in the city compelled him to request the withdrawal of British troops from the city to Castle William.&#91;51&#93; Hutchinson was able to postpone the trial for almost 6 months to allow anger to settle and for Adams to prepare a solid case. The soldiers were eventually tried, and two were convicted of manslaughter, although their sentences were reduced.  The episode shook Hutchinson's confidence in his ability to manage affairs in the province, and he penned a resignation letter.&#91;52&#93;
Governor Bernard had, in the meantime, taken up Hutchinson's cause in London.  In March 1771 Hutchinson's commission as governor arrived in Boston, having been approved by the king while his resignation letter was going the other way.  (Colonial secretary Lord Hillsborough rejected his resignation.)&#91;53&#93;  The instructions sent with the commission were fairly strict, and left Hutchinson relatively little room to manoeuvre politically.  Instructions that particularly galled Samuel Adams included one restricting the meetings of the governor's council, and another limiting the appointment of colonial agents to individuals having the governor's approval.&#91;54&#93;
One of Hutchinson's instructions was to relocate the provincial assembly from Boston to Cambridge, where it would be less under the influence of radical Boston politics.  This modest demand, accomplished by executive order, resulted in howls of complaint of gubernatorial arbitrariness in the assembly, and an exchange of arguments, rebuttals, and counterarguments between Hutchinson and the assembly that ran for thousands of pages and lasted until 1772.&#91;55&#93; The nature of the affair furthered the radical cause, whose proponents painted Hutchinson's action as a bold and devious attempt to further the executive prerogative.&#91;56&#93; The radicals were further outraged when Hutchinson announced in 1772 that his salary, which had previously been subject to appropriation by the assembly, would be paid by the crown instead. This was seen by the radicals as a further usurpation of power that rightfully belonged in the province.&#91;57&#93;  Written debates with the assembly extended to the role of Parliament in governing the policies, and further deepened the divide between it and Hutchinson. They also raised flags elsewhere in the colonies and in England, where observers noted that Hutchinson's arguments had effectively driven moderates in the province to join with the political hardliners.&#91;58&#93;
The Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in 1772 when Hutchinson, in a speech to the assembly, argued that either the colony was wholly subject to Parliament, or that it was effectively independent.  The assembly's response, authored by John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Joseph Hawley, countered that the colonial charter granted autonomy.&#91;59&#93;  In England the colonial secretary, Lord Dartmouth, insisted to colonial agent Benjamin Franklin that the Massachusetts assembly retract its response.  Franklin had acquired a packet of letters,&#91;60&#93; written in the late 1760s by Hutchinson and other colonial officials, from which he concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies, and thus misled Parliament.  Believing that wider knowledge of these letters would focus colonial anger away from Parliament and at those who had written the misleading letters,&#91;61&#93;  Franklin sent the letters to Thomas Cushing, the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.&#91;61&#93;  He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated, because he was not "at liberty to make the letters public."&#91;62&#93;  The letters came into the hands of Samuel Adams, then serving as the clerk of the assembly, who engineered their publication in June 1773.&#91;63&#93;&#91;64&#93;&#91;65&#93;  Franklin's belief was only partially vindicated: the publication of the letters unleashed a torrent of vitriol against Hutchinson, but did nothing to lessen opposition to Parliamentary policy: instead the opposition saw the letters as confirmation of a conspiracy against their rights.&#91;66&#93;  The letters were reprinted throughout the colonies, and Hutchinson was burned in effigy in places as far away as Philadelphia during the uproar.&#91;67&#93;
Hutchinson's letters, written between 1767 and 1769 to Thomas Whately, a retired former leading member of the British government, included the observation that it was impossible for colonists to have the full rights they would have in the home country, essentially requiring an "abridgement of what are called English liberties".&#91;68&#93;  He made no specific proposals on how the colonial government should be reformed, writing in a letter that was not among those published, "I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event."&#91;69&#93;  Letters by Andrew Oliver, in contrast, specifically proposed that the governor's council, whose members were then elected by the assembly with the governor's consent, be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.&#91;70&#93;
Although much of what Hutchinson wrote in the letters was not particularly new, Samuel Adams masterfully manipulated the contents and implications of some of the statements by Hutchinson and Oliver to suggest they were conspiring with officials in London to deprive the colonists of their rights.&#91;71&#93;  Hutchinson was defended in print by provincial attorney general Jonathan Sewall, who claimed that Hutchinson was not actually expressing desired changes in the state of affairs, but ruminating instead on possible consequences of present conditions.&#91;72&#93;
The Massachusetts assembly drafted a petition to the Board of Trade demanding Hutchinson's removal from office, and Hutchinson, concerned with the effect the letter publication and the assembly petition would have in London, requested permission to come to England to defend himself.&#91;73&#93;  The letter authorizing his return did not reach Boston until November 1773, too late for him to depart that year;&#91;74&#93; his request and the assembly's petition would not be heard until early 1774.&#91;75&#93;
In the meantime, Parliament had repealed most of the Townshend taxes (keeping only the one on tea), and passed the Tea Act, which authorised the British East India Company to ship tea directly to the colonies, eliminating colonial merchants from its supply chain and undercutting the price of smuggled Dutch tea.&#91;76&#93;&#91;77&#93;  This caused colonial merchants all over the North American colonies to organise opposition to the deliveries of the company's tea.&#91;78&#93; In Massachusetts the arrival of ships carrying tea in November 1773 brought about a crisis, since duties were to be paid on dutiable cargo within twenty days of a ship's arrival.  Hutchinson and his sons were among the businessmen to whom the company had consigned its tea, although Hutchinson disclaimed any official role in the choice of consignee.&#91;79&#93;  Other cargo was unloaded from the ships, but armed protestors patrolled the docks to ensure the tea was not landed.  Hutchinson took a hard line, refusing to allow the tea ships to leave the harbour despite citywide protests that the tea be sent back to England, and insisting that the duty be paid and the tea landed.  When the twenty-day deadline arrived on 16 December, protestors (some in Indian disguise) boarded the ships that night and dumped the tea into the harbour.&#91;80&#93;
Hutchinson justified the hardline stance that contributed to the crisis by claiming it was his duty as governor to uphold the revenue laws, while American opponents such as James Bowdoin observed that he could have just as easily refused to accept the tea when it was clear that popular sentiment would make it impossible to land the tea. British critics complained that he should have asked the British troops in Boston to intervene.  After it became known that other tea ships sent to North America had turned back, Hutchinson continued to justify his actions in letters to England, anticipating hearings on the matter once he arrived there.&#91;81&#93;
When the Board of Trade met to consider the assembly's petition to recall Hutchinson, it also discussed the tea party.  Franklin, as colonial agent, was forced to listen to a barrage of criticism, and was dismissed as colonial postmaster general.  The assembly's petition was dismissed as "groundless" and "vexatious", but Hutchinson's request for leave was granted.&#91;75&#93;&#91;82&#93;  In May 1774 General Thomas Gage arrived in Boston to take over as governor, and to implement the "Coercive Acts" Parliament had passed as punishment for the tea party.  Hutchinson, believing he would only be away from Massachusetts temporarily, sailed for England on 1 June 1774.&#91;83&#93;
Upon his arrival in London, Hutchinson was granted an audience with the king, who questioned him on affairs in North America, and he was well received by Rockingham, Dartmouth, and Lord North, the prime minister.&#91;84&#93;  In his interview with North he expressed dismay at the terms of the Massachusetts Government Act, and sought to establish a basis for the eventual repeal of the Boston Port Act, whose enactment by Governor Gage had a crippling effect on the province's economy.  One part of the Government Act, the appointment by the crown of the governor's council, was something he had long opposed without formal hearings on the matter, but even colonial authorities sympathetic to his view believed events had by 1774 gone too far for the British political establishment to support alternatives.&#91;85&#93;  At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775 his Milton mansion was seized for use as an army barracks, and a trunk containing copies of much of his correspondence fell into rebel hands.&#91;86&#93;
As the war progressed, Hutchinson was criticised by the Whigs in Parliament, which he answered in an unpublished manuscript.  He continued to be treated favourably by the king, but was compelled to refuse the offer of a baronetcy because most of his fortune was lost due to his exile,&#91;87&#93; and became marginalised from power as prosecution of the war took center stage.&#91;88&#93;  On 4 July 1776, Hutchinson was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Oxford University.  His enemies in Massachusetts continued to attack his reputation, and his exile made it impossible to effectively dispute the charges they made.  His properties, like those of other exiled Loyalists, were seized and sold off by the state; his Milton home was eventually purchased by James and Mercy Otis Warren (the latter being the sister of his long-time enemy James Otis, Jr.)&#91;89&#93;&#91;90&#93;
Bitter and disillusioned about his forced exile, and grieving the loss of his daughter Peggy in 1777, Hutchinson continued to work on his history of the colony which was the fruit of many decades of research. Two volumes were published in his lifetime: Volume 1 of the History of Massachusetts appeared in 1764, and Volume 2 in 1767.  The third volume would be published posthumously, and included his own tenure as lieutenant governor and governor.  At the same time he worked to complete a history of the Hutchinson family, in which he encapsulated details on political affairs not found elsewhere.&#91;91&#93;  He suffered a stroke and died at Brompton in west London on 3 June 1780, aged 68, and was buried in Croydon Minster in south London.&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93;
Because of his central role as the main focal point for the opposition to royal rule, Hutchinson's reputation in America was generally quite poor. He was often seen as a traitor to his native Massachusetts and to the cause of freedom. John Adams was characteristically harsh in his assessment of him, calling him "avaricious" and describing him as a "courtier" who manipulated those at higher levels of power to achieve his aims.&#91;94&#93;  He was also criticized by British political figures: Thomas Pownall continued to disagree with Hutchinson after the latter's exile, Francis Bernard (despite working on Hutchinson's behalf) disapproved of some of his actions, and Lord North believed the publication of his letters to be responsible for the outbreak of the war.&#91;95&#93;
Biographers in the 20th century have, however, rehabilitated his reputation, seeking to explain how and why he came to be demonized in this way.&#91;96&#93;  In recent decades historians have typically portrayed Hutchinson as a tragic figure torn between his rulers in London and his people in Massachusetts. Barbara Tuchman, for example, portrays Hutchinson as an "ill-fated" and "tragic figure."&#91;97&#93;  British scholar David Kenneth Fieldhouse says his tragedy emerged because he was "a victim of the clash of two ideologies, his own archaic and static, that of his opponents contemporary and dynamic."&#91;98&#93;  Carl L. Becker, a prominent American historian wrote: "Nothing would have pleased him [Hutchinson] more than that New England should have shown its emancipation from provincialism by meriting the good will of the King. His irritation with America in general and Boston in particular was the irritation of a proud and possessive father with a beloved but wayward child who fails to do him credit in high places." Bailyn has changed his own interpretation over the years. In the 1970s he saw Hutchinson as a bewildered pragmatist.  By 2004 he portrayed Hutchinson as a premodern thinker locked in an old mindset at a time when Enlightenment ideas were taking hold thanks to thinkers such as Adam Smith and Tom Paine.&#91;99&#93;
Remnants of Hutchinson's country estate in Milton have been preserved.  The main piece, a parcel of land known as Governor Hutchinson's Field, is owned by The Trustees of the Reservations, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is open to the public, and a nearby property features a ha-ha constructed for Hutchinson in 1771.  The ha-ha is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and both properties are part of the Milton Hill Historic District.&#91;100&#93;&#91;101&#93; Boston, which had landmarks named after the Hutchinson family, took pains upon his departure to rename them.&#91;102&#93;
In the 2015 miniseries Sons of Liberty, Hutchinson is portrayed by Sean Gilder.

Susannah Caroline Constantine&#91;1&#93; (born 3 June 1962)&#91;2&#93; is an English fashion guru, journalist, artist, advisor, television presenter, author, and designer and actress. Her second book, What Not to Wear,  co-written with her fashion partner Trinny Woodall, won her a British Book Award and sold 670,000 copies.
Constantine was born into a wealthy family; her father was successful in property and shipping sectors. She was privately educated as a child and went on to date British royalty, David, Viscount Linley, during the 1980s.  Constantine has been involved in fashion for a long period, originally working in America for Giorgio Armani and then John Galliano in London. She met Trinny Woodall in 1994, with whom she both proceeded to write a weekly fashion column, Ready to Wear. They founded Ready2shop.com, a dot-com fashion advice business, and wrote their first fashion advice book in 2000, Ready 2 Dress, both of which failed. From there they were commissioned to BBC Two to host the style series, What Not to Wear, from 2001 to 2005. She made regular appearances as a style advisor on The Oprah Winfrey Show and following her success on the shows, she went on to co-host Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress... on ITV in 2006 and Undress the Nation in 2007.
She has co-written fashion advice books with Woodall, some of which have become best-sellers in the United Kingdom and United States. It is estimated that her various style advice books have sold 2.5 ;million copies in Britain and the United States.&#91;3&#93; Constantine and Woodall have designed their own clothing range for Littlewoods which made its debut in 2007, followed by the release of their latest fashion advice book, The Body Shape Bible.
Constantine was born at Hammersmith, and raised at Knipton, a small village in Leicestershire.&#91;4&#93; Her father, Joseph Constantine, was an Old Etonian who served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards. He was of a Yorkshire landed gentry family that traces back to the 1100s.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93; Through her paternal grandmother, Marie Leonie Francoise (née van Haaren), she descends from Dutch prince William the Silent.&#91;5&#93;
Constantine was privately educated at boarding schools including Queen's Gate School in South Kensington, London&#91;7&#93; and the £20,000-per-year St Mary's School in Wantage, Oxfordshire which was run by Anglican nuns. She was first sent to boarding school at the age of 11 years, and recalls her first night away from home: "I sobbed uncontrollably into my pillow."&#91;8&#93;
In mid-2007, Constantine spoke about how she received a letter from St Mary's School, inviting her to come back to the school to talk about her career and success to current pupils. Constantine immediately declined the offer and wrote "No fucking way" on the letter she had received.&#91;9&#93;
Constantine originally did a year of Montessori training after she had left school but she then moved onto other projects&#91;7&#93; such as studying sculpture in Brussels. She later said of this time that she "lost [her] virginity, went a bit mad."&#91;10&#93; Constantine had taught children for three years,&#91;11&#93; and also worked as a shop girl for Harrods.&#91;7&#93;&#91;12&#93; She wrote a book about present giving, which prompted The Daily Telegraph to write an article implying she had never done a day's work in her life, something which deeply upset her.&#91;13&#93; She has stated "I've always worked."&#91;8&#93;
She is now best known as a style advisor. Her fashion career started when she worked as a shop girl in America for Giorgio Armani.&#91;11&#93; She later came back to London with the hope of securing a job with Armani but ended up working for designers such as Richard James, Patrick Cox,&#91;10&#93; Alistair Blair and John Galliano which gained her an understanding of fashion.&#91;11&#93; She then started working with the British Brain and Spine Foundation and consequently met the sports editor of The Daily Telegraph.&#91;11&#93; Whilst doing a piece for GMTV, he asked Constantine to report the women's World Cup Final in cricket. She proceeded to write about cars and then fashion.&#91;11&#93;
In 1994, she first met Trinny Woodall at a party hosted by David, Viscount Linley.&#91;12&#93; Though they did not like each other at first, the two women proceeded to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran for seven years.&#91;12&#93; The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure.&#91;7&#93; Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed £10 ;million.&#91;14&#93;
Constantine made her television debut when Granada Sky Broadcasting signed her and Woodall to present a daytime shopping show called Ready to Wear, and they released their first fashion advice book, Ready 2 Dress in 2000.&#91;12&#93; The book was unsuccessful and resulted in the pulping of 13,000 copies.&#91;15&#93; Soon after the start of their television career, they secured a frequent makeover slot on the show Richard &amp; Judy. It ensured that they had further exposure in television and gained attention from Jane Root, controller of BBC Two, who signed them up after their book venture and their internet business had failed badly.&#91;12&#93;
Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, in which they criticised participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their behaviour with the participants, direct advice,&#91;16&#93; and frequently referring to breasts as tits.&#91;17&#93; A notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible.&#91;18&#93; Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with.&#91;10&#93; Constantine insists that their subjects "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know."&#91;10&#93; She also stated "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who have an opinion, who care how ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!"&#91;10&#93; The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as "the one with 'big tits'."&#91;17&#93;
Constantine has the belief that "anyone can achieve style. It doesn't matter who you are or where you're from."&#91;17&#93; She also says that she finds dressing other women easy, but finds it difficult when dressing herself.&#91;18&#93; Constantine and Woodall share the belief that dressing to flatter body shape is vital, stating "For us, it’s all about shape, and how that is going to cure a bodily defect. We’re like clothing doctors."&#91;7&#93;
During her time co-hosting What Not to Wear, she and Woodall won a Royal Television Society Award in 2002 for being the best factual presenters.&#91;19&#93; In 2002, Constantine advised Jeremy Clarkson on a celebrity version of What Not to Wear.&#91;20&#93; After Clarkson appeared on the show, Nasir Khan stated "I'd rather eat my own hair than shop with these two [Constantine and Woodall] again".&#91;17&#93; The show was nominated for the Features Award at the BAFTAS in both 2002 and 2003.&#91;21&#93; On the show Big Impression, impressionist Ronni Ancona took to spoofing Constantine's presenting techniques on What Not to Wear.&#91;14&#93;&#91;22&#93;
For charity, in 2002 during the BBC's Children in Need programme, both Constantine and Woodall performed their own version of Madonna's hit single "Vogue".&#91;23&#93; They became the faces of Nescafé in 2003 in which they were featured in television advertisements promoting the brand of coffee. As part of their contract, Constantine and Woodall gave a Nescafé competition winner a £10,000 makeover.&#91;24&#93;
Following its ratings success, What Not to Wear was promoted from BBC Two to BBC One in 2004. The format was changed slightly, to a 60-minute show with two makeovers instead of a 30-minute show with only one makeover&#91;25&#93; and also saw Constantine spending a day as one of her subjects. What Not to Wear was also aired in countries such as Spain and Portugal as well as in the American continent.
Constantine appeared on Children in Need in 2004, which included a special segment in which she gave the fictional EastEnders characters Little Mo and Mo Harris a makeover in the style of What Not to Wear, commenting on them with her usual "no nonsense" approach.&#91;26&#93; In 2005, Constantine voiced a robot version of herself in the science fiction series, Doctor Who.
The Oprah Winfrey Show has also seen Constantine and Woodall appearing twice as makeover and style experts.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93; They also did an "Oprah bra and swimsuit intervention".&#91;29&#93; Reflecting on differences in women's style and willingness to submit to makeovers between the UK and America, she stated that although there is not much difference, "The Americans are slightly less adventurous," and that "American women are more open to change and slightly more receptive victims."&#91;30&#93;
In 2006, Constantine and Woodall moved from the BBC to ITV to start a new show, Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress..., on 3 October. The second series of Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress... was transmitted in June 2007, and it maintained the format of series one which saw Constantine and Woodall advising couples who were finding problems within their marriage.&#91;31&#93; Constantine stated in an interview that filming the show was very emotionally draining, and as a result, she often went home crying.&#91;7&#93; The programme did not come without its critics who questioned the depth at which Constantine and Woodall could deal with serious issues raised during the programme.&#91;7&#93; On 16 October 2006, they both appeared on NBC's The Today Show and performed makeovers on three women especially for the show.&#91;32&#93;
The new series on ITV saw a change in format, in one episode exploring the theme of age, Constantine was transformed into a seventy-year-old with the use of prosthetics and makeup. She stated that it took her four days to get over the sight of herself aged so drastically, and compared the feeling to having an "electric shock".&#91;10&#93; Broadcasting was scheduled for 7 November 2007 and the programme is newly entitled Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress The Nation. On 5 November and 28 December 2007 Constantine and Woodall appeared on Good Morning America and performed makeovers on three women for the show and gave style advice according to the women's shapes.&#91;33&#93; They also reported on the fashion at the 80th Academy Awards especially for the show in 2008.&#91;34&#93; Constantine and Woodall have dressed over 5,000 women as of 2007.&#91;35&#93;
In 2015, Constantine took part in the fifteenth series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. She was the first campmate to be eliminated from the show.&#91;36&#93;
On 21 August 2018, it was announced that Constantine would be a contestant on the sixteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing.&#91;37&#93; Her professional dance partner was Anton du Beke. She and du Beke were the first couple to be eliminated from the competition after scoring the lowest scoring Samba and Foxtrot in the show's history, both which scored just 12 points from the judges.&#91;38&#93;
In 2010, Constantine and Woodall starred in an online mockumentary series called "Trinny and Susannah: What They Did Next".&#91;39&#93;
An announcement was made that Constantine and Woodall would be touring New Zealand and Australia where they made a series of public appearances at shopping malls owned by the Westfield Group to perform live styling sessions for the company's customers.&#91;40&#93;&#91;41&#93;&#91;42&#93; Their appearances often attracted thousands of spectators.&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93; Before the tour, Constantine said "We don't know how New Zealanders dress but we are looking forward to getting over there and finding out."&#91;45&#93;
With Woodall, Constantine became the face of the home shopping company, Littlewoods Direct, after orders rose by thirty per cent when Littlewoods sponsored their ITV programme Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress.&#91;46&#93; The pair produced a twelve-page fashion advice section within the Littlewoods catalogue and made a booklet called The Golden Rules, which was distributed to all Littlewoods customers with fashion advice to suit a range of body shapes.&#91;46&#93; They have also produced online style guidelines for Littlewoods.&#91;46&#93;
The first series of Littlewoods television advertisements featured Constantine and Woodall as themselves dressed as two agents trying to rob a Littlewoods designer warehouse, which was followed by Christmas adverts in 2007.&#91;47&#93;&#91;48&#93; The £12 ;million advertising campaign is one of largest ever for a home shopping and internet-based company.&#91;49&#93; When the campaign began, Littlewoods' sales rose by 18 per cent, with brand awareness and customers visiting the website rising as well.&#91;50&#93;
On 20 September 2007, Constantine and Woodall launched their own Littlewoods women's clothing range which consists of trousers, coats and tops which like their underwear range, are designed to make certain areas appear slimmer.&#91;7&#93; A series of eight dresses, cashmere knitwear, faux fur and sequinned shrugs also feature in the range.&#91;51&#93;
Constantine has co-written several style advice books with her fashion partner Trinny Woodall, which have sold over an estimated 2½ million copies worldwide.&#91;3&#93; The fashion advice books have been number one bestsellers in Britain and the United States, appearing on both the Sunday Times bestseller list&#91;52&#93; and The New York Times best-seller list,&#91;53&#93; and have been translated throughout the world.&#91;54&#93;
Their most successful book to date, What Not to Wear, was published in 2002 which displayed chapters such as "Big Tits", "No Tits" and "Big Bum" with fashion advice for each category.&#91;55&#93; It became an instant best-seller with total sales reaching 670,000 copies.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93; Before the prime book selling season, their book had sold 250,000 copies in Britain.&#91;57&#93; The book was at one point selling 45,000 copies each week and sold 300,000 copies in just fifteen weeks,&#91;58&#93; eventually making sales worth £8.7 ;million.&#91;55&#93; Other success with the book includes winning a British Book Award in 2003 for the TV &amp; Film Book of the Year.&#91;59&#93; Despite the book becoming an instant hit, Constantine and Woodall were only given an advance of £10,000.&#91;57&#93; It was then reported that Constantine and Woodall secured a £1 ;million book deal to write more of their fashion books.&#91;60&#93;
The pair's latest book, The Body Shape Bible, was published on 18 September 2007.&#91;30&#93; In the book, women can interpret which body shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape.&#91;10&#93; A few pages in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall's own fashion disasters.&#91;51&#93;
In 2017 she published her first novel, After the Snow.&#91;61&#93;
When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to accept. His death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.&#91;18&#93;
Constantine became a fixture in 1980s British gossip columns and newspapers as the result of her relationship with Princess Margaret's son, David, Viscount Linley which lasted for eight years.&#91;15&#93; Constantine admitted that her relationship with Linley undeniably opened doors for her, but after they broke up, she was keen to put the episode behind her and become well known in her own right.&#91;13&#93; She dated Imran Khan, then a cricketer and playboy, later Prime Minister of Pakistan, in 1992. She also visited Pakistan in the time of the short-lived relationship.&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93; Constantine married Danish entrepreneur and businessman Sten Bertelsen, who launched Death cigarettes,&#91;13&#93; with whom she has three children; Joe, Esme and CeCe.&#91;7&#93;&#91;12&#93; Constantine and her family bought a 120-acre (0.49 ;km2) property in Sussex.&#91;7&#93;
Constantine has spoken of the pressure to look good in public but affirms "We're as much in the business of dressing ourselves – but more importantly helping other women to do that."&#91;51&#93; Constantine has admitted to a fear of growing older: "I just don't want to get old. Old women are invisible, and I don't want to be invisible," she has said.&#91;10&#93;
In 2002, while on a visit to the Cannes Film Festival, Constantine and Woodall were the victims of gem thieves. The thieves broke into the villa on the French Riviera where they were staying, rendered Constantine and Woodall unconscious with chloroform, and then continued to steal money and jewellery.&#91;64&#93;
Carol Vorderman was involved in a feud with Constantine and Woodall in 2003. Vorderman commented harshly about the double-act, referring to them as 'Tranny and the Horse', based on their appearance, after they had called her an "overdone Eighties nightmare" and named Vorderman in their list of the 20 worst-dressed celebrities.&#91;65&#93;
In August 2014, Constantine was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.&#91;66&#93;

Condensed list of historical anniversaries.


Anna Sofia Palm de Rosa (25 December 1859 ;&#8211;&#32;2 May 1924) was a Swedish artist and landscape painter. In the 1890s she became one of Sweden's most popular painters with her watercolours of steamers and sailing ships and scenes of Stockholm. She also painted a memorable picture of a game of cards in Skagen's Brøndums Hotel while she spent a summer with the Skagen Painters. At the age of 36, Anna Palm left Sweden for good, spending the rest of her life in the south of Italy, where she married an infantry officer.&#91;1&#93;
Born on Christmas Day 1859 in Stockholm, Palm de Rosa was the daughter of the painter Gustaf Wilhelm Palm and Eva Sandberg, who was the daughter of the painter Johan Gustaf Sandberg. The family home at No. 19 Barnhuträdgårdgatan (today Olof Palmas Gata) was a popular meeting place for their artist friends including Nils Kreuger, Gustaf Cederström, Georg Pauli and Vicke Andrén (1856-1930). Anna Palm was educated privately by her father who taught at the Elementary Drawing School (Elementarteckningsskolan) which prepared students for the Royal Swedish Academy of Art.&#91;2&#93;
She did not attend the Royal Academy itself as it was still unusual for women to study there. In the 1880s, she became a student of the history painter Edvard Perséus and the landscape painter Per Daniel Holm (1835–1903). In 1885, with her parents' support, she travelled to Denmark where she spent some time in Skagen, painting Et l'hombre parti på Brøndums Hotel (A game of L'hombre in Brøndums Hotel).&#91;3&#93; She also went to Antwerp where she studied under the marine painter Romain Steppe (1859–1927) before spending some time in Paris.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;
Palm de Rosa was one of 84 artists who signed a letter in 1885 calling for radical changes in the Swedish Academy's teaching which they considered to be outdated. She nevertheless exhibited at the Academy in 1885 and 1887 and from 1889 to 1891 taught watercolour painting there. She was also a member of the recently formed association: Svenska konstnärinnor (Swedish female artists) together with Eva Bonnier, Hanna Pauli and Mina Carlson-Bredberg. The watercolours of marine scenes with steamers and sailing ships she painted around this time contributed to her rising popularity. She began to produce numerous small vedute to satisfy her many customers while also painting scenes of the city of Stockholm.&#91;5&#93;
On New Year's Eve 1895, at the age of 36, she left Sweden never to return. After spending a year in Paris, she moved to Italy where she met her husband to be, Infantry Lieutenant Alfredo de Rosa. After their wedding in Paris in 1901, the couple moved first to Capri, then finally settled in the Madonna dell'Arco, district of Sant'Anastasia, near Naples in 1908.
In addition to scenes of Italian life, she continued to paint landscapes of Stockholm including scenes of Gustaf Adolfs torg with the opera building as well as views of the 1897 Art and Industrial Exposition in Stockholm. The only explanation for her interest in such recent developments is that she must have received photographs from Sweden as a basis for her paintings. She may well have used of photographs taken by the Stockholm photographer Frans Gustaf Klemming (1859–1922), who also was behind some of the oil painting of Robert Lundberg (1861–1903), but she probably drew on views taken by various photographers.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;
During the First World War when her husband was called up, Palm de Rosa became extremely productive in her painting, especially in Baiae on the Gulf of Naples where she spent a year. After the war, she grew increasingly frail until her death in May 1924.&#91;5&#93;
Her work is represented at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Gothenburg Art Museum and Uppsala University as well as at museums in Norrköping and Helsinki.&#91;7&#93;

Stockholm (Swedish pronunciation: ;[ˈstɔ̂kː(h)ɔlm]&#32;(listen))&#91;8&#93; is the capital and most populous urban area of Sweden as well as in Scandinavia. 975,904 people live in the municipality,&#91;9&#93; approximately 1.6 ;million in the urban area,&#91;5&#93; and 2.4 ;million in the metropolitan area.&#91;9&#93; The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake Mälaren flows into the Baltic Sea. Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the county seat of Stockholm County.
Stockholm is the cultural, media, political, and economic centre of Sweden. The Stockholm region alone accounts for over a third of the country's GDP,&#91;10&#93; and is among the top 10 regions in Europe by GDP per capita.&#91;11&#93; Ranked as an alpha global city,&#91;12&#93; it is the largest in Scandinavia and the main centre for corporate headquarters in the Nordic region.&#91;13&#93; The city is home to some of Europe's top ranking universities, such as the Stockholm School of Economics, Karolinska Institute and KTH Royal Institute of Technology.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; It hosts the annual Nobel Prize ceremonies and banquet at the Stockholm Concert Hall and Stockholm City Hall. One of the city's most prized museums, the Vasa Museum, is the most visited non-art museum in Scandinavia.&#91;16&#93;&#91;17&#93; The Stockholm metro, opened in 1950, is well known for the decor of its stations; it has been called the longest art gallery in the world.&#91;18&#93;&#91;19&#93;&#91;20&#93; Sweden's national football arena is located north of the city centre, in Solna. Ericsson Globe, the national indoor arena, is in the southern part of the city. The city was the host of the 1912 Summer Olympics, and hosted the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics otherwise held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
Stockholm is the seat of the Swedish government and most of its agencies,&#91;21&#93; including the highest courts in the judiciary,&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; and the official residencies of the Swedish monarch and the Prime Minister. The government has its seat in the Rosenbad building, the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) is seated in the Parliament House, and the Prime Minister's residence is adjacent at Sager House.&#91;24&#93;&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; Stockholm Palace is the official residence and principal workplace of the Swedish monarch, while Drottningholm Palace, a World Heritage Site on the outskirts of Stockholm, serves as the Royal Family's private residence.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;
After the Ice Age, around 8,000 BC, there were already many people living in what is today the Stockholm area, but as temperatures dropped, inhabitants moved south. Thousands of years later, as the ground thawed, the climate became tolerable and the lands became fertile, people began to migrate back to the North. At the intersection of the Baltic Sea and lake Mälaren is an archipelago site where the Old Town of Stockholm was first built from about 1000 CE by Vikings. They had a positive trade impact on the area because of the trade routes they created.
Stockholm's location appears in Norse sagas as Agnafit, and in Heimskringla in connection with the legendary king Agne. The earliest written mention of the name Stockholm dates from 1252, by which time the mines in Bergslagen made it an important site in the iron trade. The first part of the name (stock) means log in Swedish, although it may also be connected to an old German word (Stock) meaning fortification. The second part of the name (holm) means islet and is thought to refer to the islet Helgeandsholmen in central Stockholm. According to the Eric Chronicles the city is said to have been founded by Birger Jarl to protect Sweden from sea invasions made by Karelians after the pillage of Sigtuna on Lake Mälaren in the summer of 1187.&#91;29&#93;
Stockholm's core, the present Old Town (Gamla Stan) was built on the central island next to Helgeandsholmen from the mid-13th century onward. The city originally rose to prominence as a result of the Baltic trade of the Hanseatic League. Stockholm developed strong economic and cultural linkages with Lübeck, Hamburg, Gdańsk, Visby, Reval, and Riga during this time.&#91;30&#93; Between 1296 and 1478 Stockholm's City Council was made up of 24 members, half of whom were selected from the town's German-speaking burghers.
The strategic and economic importance of the city made Stockholm an important factor in relations between the Danish Kings of the Kalmar Union and the national independence movement in the 15th century. The Danish King Christian II was able to enter the city in 1520. On 8 November 1520, a massacre of opposition figures called the Stockholm Bloodbath took place and set off further uprisings that eventually led to the breakup of the Kalmar Union. With the accession of Gustav Vasa in 1523 and the establishment of royal power, the population of Stockholm began to grow, reaching 10,000 by 1600.
The 17th century saw Sweden grow into a major European power, reflected in the development of the city of Stockholm. From 1610 to 1680 the population multiplied sixfold. In 1634, Stockholm became the official capital of the Swedish empire. Trading rules were also created that gave Stockholm an essential monopoly over trade between foreign merchants and other Swedish and Scandinavian territories. In 1697, Tre Kronor (castle) burned and was replaced by Stockholm Palace.
In 1710, a plague killed about 20,000 (36 percent) of the population.&#91;31&#93; After the end of the Great Northern War the city stagnated. Population growth halted and economic growth slowed. The city was in shock after having lost its place as the capital of a Great power. However, Stockholm maintained its role as the political center of Sweden and continued to develop culturally under Gustav III.
By the second half of the 19th century, Stockholm had regained its leading economic role. New industries emerged and Stockholm was transformed into an important trade and service center as well as a key gateway point within Sweden. The population also grew dramatically during this time, mainly through immigration. At the end of the 19th century, less than 40% of the residents were Stockholm-born. Settlement began to expand outside the city limits. The 19th century saw the establishment of a number of scientific institutes, including the Karolinska Institutet. The General Art and Industrial Exposition was held in 1897. From 1887 to 1953 the Old Stockholm telephone tower was a landmark; originally built to link phone lines, it became redundant after these were buried, and it was latterly used for advertising.
Stockholm became a modern, technologically advanced, and ethnically diverse city in the latter half of the 20th century. Many historical buildings were torn down during the modernist era, including substantial parts of the historical district of Klara, and replaced with modern architecture. However, in many other parts of Stockholm (such as in Gamla stan, Södermalm, Östermalm, Kungsholmen and Vasastan), many "old" buildings, blocks and streets built before the modernism and functionalism movements took off in Sweden (around 1930–35) survived this era of demolition. Throughout the century, many industries shifted away from industrial activities into more high-tech and service industry areas.
Currently, Stockholm's metropolitan area is one of the fastest-growing regions in Europe, and its population is expected to number 2.5 ;million by 2024. As a result of this massive population growth, there has been a proposal to build densely packed high-rise buildings in the city center connected by elevated walkways.&#91;32&#93;
Stockholm is located on Sweden's east coast, where the freshwater Lake Mälaren ;— Sweden's third-largest lake ;— flows out into the Baltic Sea. The central parts of the city consist of fourteen islands that are continuous with the Stockholm archipelago. The geographical city center is situated on the water, in Riddarfjärden bay. Over 30% of the city area is made up of waterways and another 30% is made up of parks and green spaces.
Positioned at the eastern end of the Central Swedish lowland, the city's location reflect the early orientation of Swedish trade toward the Baltic region.&#91;33&#93;
Stockholm belongs to the Temperate deciduous forest biome, which means the climate is very similar to that of the far northeastern area of the United States and coastal Nova Scotia in Canada. The average annual temperature is 7.6 ;°C (46 ;°F). The average rainfall is 531 ;mm (21 ;in) a year. The deciduous forest has four distinct seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In the autumn the leaves change color. During the winter months, the trees lose their leaves.
For details about the other municipalities in the Stockholm area, see the pertinent articles. North of Stockholm Municipality: Järfälla, Solna, Täby, Sollentuna, Lidingö, Upplands Väsby, Österåker, Sigtuna, Sundbyberg, Danderyd, Vallentuna, Ekerö, Upplands-Bro, Vaxholm, and Norrtälje. South of Stockholm: Huddinge, Nacka, Botkyrka, Haninge, Tyresö, Värmdö, Södertälje, Salem, Nykvarn and Nynäshamn.
Stockholm Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders. The semi-official name for the municipality is City of Stockholm (Stockholms stad in Swedish).&#91;34&#93; As a municipality, the City of Stockholm is subdivided into district councils, which carry responsibility for primary schools, social, leisure and cultural services within their respective areas. The municipality is usually described in terms of its three main parts: Innerstaden (Stockholm City Centre), Söderort (Southern Stockholm) and Västerort (Western Stockholm). The districts of these parts are:
The modern centre Norrmalm (concentrated around the town square Sergels torg) is the largest shopping district in Sweden.&#91;35&#93; It is the most central part of Stockholm in business and shopping.
Stockholm has an oceanic climate in the 0 ;°C isotherm (Köppen: Cfb)&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93; and a humid continental climate (Dfb) in the -3 ;°C isotherm. Although winters are cold, average temperatures generally remain above 0 ;°C for much of the year. Summers are mild, and precipitation occurs throughout the year.&#91;38&#93;
Due to the city's high northerly latitude, the length of the day varies widely from more than 18 hours around midsummer to only around 6 hours in late December. The nights from late May until mid-July are bright even when cloudy. Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at a similar latitude, or even farther south. With an average of just over 1800 hours of sunshine per year, it is also one of the sunniest cities in Northern Europe, receiving more sunshine than Paris,&#91;39&#93; London&#91;40&#93; and a few other major European cities of a more southerly latitude. Because of the urban heat island effect and the prevailing wind traveling overland rather than sea during summer months, Stockholm has the warmest July months of the Nordic capitals. Stockholm has an annual average snow cover between 75 and 100 days.&#91;41&#93;
In spite of its mild climate, Stockholm is located further north than parts of Canada that are above the Arctic tree line at sea level.&#91;42&#93;
Summers average daytime high temperatures of 20–25 ;°C (68–77 ;°F) and lows of around 13 ;°C (55 ;°F), but temperatures can reach 30 ;°C (86 ;°F) on some days. Days above 30 ;°C (86 ;°F) occur on average 1.55 days per year (1992–2011).&#91;43&#93; Days between 25 ;°C (77 ;°F) and 30 ;°C (86 ;°F) are relatively common especially in July and August. Night-time lows of above 20 ;°C (68 ;°F) are rare, and hot summer nights vary from 17 to 18 ;°C (63 to 64 ;°F). Winters generally bring cloudy weather with the most precipitation falling in December and January (as rain or as snow). The average winter temperatures range from −3 to −1 ;°C (27 to 30 ;°F), and occasionally drop below −20 ;°C (−4 ;°F) in the outskirts. Spring and autumn are generally cool to mild.
The climate table below presents weather data from the years 1981–2010 although the official Köppen reference period was from 1961–1990. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during the years 1991–2009 as compared with the last series. This increase averages about 1.0 ;°C (1.8 ;°F) overall months. Warming is most pronounced during the winter months, with an increase of more than 2.0 ;°C (3.6 ;°F) in January.&#91;44&#93; For the 2002–2014 measurements some further increases have been found, although some months such as June have been relatively flat.
The highest temperature ever recorded in Stockholm was 36 ;°C (97 ;°F) on 3 July 1811; the lowest was −32 ;°C (−26 ;°F) on 20 January 1814.&#91;45&#93; The temperature has not dropped to below −25.1 ;°C (−13.2 ;°F) since 10 January 1987.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;
Annual precipitation is 531 ;mm (20.9 ;in) with around 170 wet days and light to moderate rainfall throughout the year. The precipitation is not uniformly distributed throughout the year. The second half of the year receives 50% more than the first half. Snowfall occurs mainly from December through March. Snowfall may occasionally occur in late October as well as in April.
In Stockholm, the aurora borealis can occasionally be observed.
Stockholm's location just south of the 60th parallel north means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter ;– about six hours ;– while in June and the first half of July, the nights are relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Around the summer solstice the sun never reaches further below the horizon than 7.3 degrees.&#91;51&#93; This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set because it does not get any darker than nautical twilight. Also, when looking straight up towards the zenith, few stars are visible after the sun has gone down. This is not to be confused with the midnight sun, which occurs north of the Arctic Circle, around 7 degrees farther north.
The Stockholm Municipal Council (Swedish: Stockholms kommunfullmäktige) is the name of the local assembly. Its 101 councillors are elected concurrently with general elections, held at the same time as the elections to the Riksdag and county councils. The Council convenes twice every month at Stockholm City Hall, and the meetings are open to the public. The matters on which the councillors decide have generally already been drafted and discussed by various boards and committees. Once decisions are referred for practical implementation, the employees of the City administrations and companies take over.&#91;52&#93;
The elected majority has a Mayor and eight Vice Mayors. The Mayor and each majority Vice Mayor is the head of a department, with responsibility for a particular area of operation, such as City Planning. The opposition also has four Vice Mayors, but they hold no executive power. Together the Mayor and the 12 Vice Mayors form the Council of Mayors, and they prepare matters for the City Executive Board. The Mayor holds a special position among the Vice Mayors, chairing both the Council of Mayors and the City Executive Board.&#91;52&#93;
The City Executive Board (Swedish: Kommunstyrelsen) is elected by the City Council and is equivalent to a cabinet. The City Executive Board renders an opinion in all matters decided by the council and bears the overall responsibility for follow-up, evaluation and execution of its decisions. The Board is also responsible for financial administration and long-term development. The City Executive Board consists of 13 members, who represent both the majority and the opposition. Its meetings are not open to the public.&#91;52&#93;
Following the 2018 Stockholm municipal election a majority of seats in the municipal council is at present held by a center/right-wing majority and the Mayor of Stockholm (Swedish: Finansborgarråd) is Anna Konig Jerlmyr from the Moderate Party.
The vast majority of Stockholm residents work in the service industry, which accounts for roughly 85% of jobs in Stockholm. The almost total absence of heavy industry (and fossil fuel power plants) makes Stockholm one of the world's cleanest metropolises. The last decade has seen a significant number of jobs created in high technology companies. Large employers include IBM, Ericsson, and Electrolux. A major IT centre is located in Kista, in northern Stockholm.
Stockholm is Sweden's financial centre. Major Swedish banks, such as Swedbank, Handelsbanken, and SEB, are headquartered in Stockholm, as are the major insurance companies Skandia, Folksam and Trygg-Hansa. Stockholm is also home to Sweden's foremost stock exchange, the Stockholm Stock Exchange (Stockholmsbörsen). Additionally, about 45% of Swedish companies with more than 200 employees are headquartered in Stockholm.&#91;53&#93; Noted clothes retailer H&amp;M is also headquartered in the city. In recent years, tourism has played an important part in the city's economy. Stockholm County is ranked as the 10th largest visitor destination in Europe, with over 10 ;million commercial overnight stays per year. Among 44 European cities, Stockholm had the 6th highest growth in the number of nights spent in the period 2004–2008.&#91;54&#93;

The city-owned company Stokab started in 1994 to build a fiber-optic network throughout the municipality as a level playing field for all operators (City of Stockholm, 2011). Around a decade later, the network was 1.2 ;million kilometres (0.7 ;million miles) long making it the longest optic fiber network in the world and now has over 90 operators and 450 enterprises as customers. 2011 was the final year of a three-year project which brought fiber to 100% of public housing, meaning an extra 95,000 houses were added. (City of Stockholm, 2011)
Research and higher education in the sciences started in Stockholm in the 18th century, with education in medicine and various research institutions such as the Stockholm Observatory. The medical education was eventually formalized in 1811 as Karolinska Institutet. KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Swedish: Kungliga Tekniska högskolan) was founded in 1827 and is currently Scandinavia's largest higher education institute of technology with 13,000 students. Stockholm University, founded in 1878 with university status granted in 1960, has 52,000 students as of 2008&#91;update&#93;. It also incorporates many historical institutions, such as the Observatory, the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and the botanical garden Bergianska trädgården. The Stockholm School of Economics, founded in 1909, is one of the few private institutions of higher education in Sweden.
In the fine arts, educational institutions include the Royal College of Music, which has a history going back to the conservatory founded as part of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 1771, the Royal University College of Fine Arts, which has a similar historical association with the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and a foundation date of 1735, and the Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting, which is the continuation of the school of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, once attended by Greta Garbo. Other schools include the design school Konstfack, founded in 1844, the University College of Opera (founded in 1968 but with older roots), the University College of Dance, and the Stockholms Musikpedagogiska Institut (the University College of Music Education).
The Södertörn University College was founded in 1995 as a multi-disciplinary institution for southern Metropolitan Stockholm, to balance the many institutions located in the northern part of the region.
Other institutes of higher education are:
The biggest complaint from students of higher education in Stockholm is the lack of student accommodations, the difficulty in finding other accommodations and the high rent.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93;
The Stockholm region is home to around 22% of Sweden's total population, and accounts for about 29% of its gross domestic product.&#91;58&#93; The geographical notion of "Stockholm" has changed over time. By the turn of the 19th century, Stockholm largely consisted of the area today known as City Centre, roughly 35 ;km2 (14 ;sq ;mi) or one-fifth of the current municipal area. In the ensuing decades several other areas were incorporated (such as Brännkyrka Municipality in 1913, at which time it had 25,000 inhabitants, and Spånga in 1949). The municipal border was established in 1971; with the exception of Hansta, in 1982 purchased by Stockholm Municipality from Sollentuna Municipality and today a nature reserve.&#91;59&#93;
Of the population of 935,619 in 2016, 461,677 were men and 473,942 women. The average age is 40 years; 40.1% of the population is between 20 and 44 years. 382,887 people, or 40.9% of the population, over the age 15 were unmarried. 259,153 people, or 27.7% of the population, were married. 99,524 or 10.6% of the population, had been married but divorced. 299,925 people or 32.1% of Stockholm's residents are of an immigrant or non-Swedish background.&#91;61&#93;
As of October 2018, there were 201,821 foreign-born people in Stockholm. The largest group of them are the Finns (17,000), followed by Iraqis (16,275), Poles (11,994) and Iranians (11,429).
Residents of Stockholm are known as Stockholmers ("stockholmare"). Languages spoken in Greater Stockholm outside of Swedish include Finnish, one of the official minority languages of Sweden; and English, as well as Albanian, Bosnian, Syriac, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, Persian, Dutch, Spanish, Serbian and Croatian.
The entire Stockholm metropolitan area, consisting of 26 municipalities, has a population of over 2.2 ;million,&#91;62&#93; making it the most populous city in the Nordic region.&#91;63&#93; The Stockholm urban area, defined only for statistical purposes, had a total population of 1,630,738 in 2015. In the following municipalities some of the districts are contained within the Stockholm urban area, though not all:&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;
Apart from being Sweden's capital, Stockholm houses many national cultural institutions. The Stockholm region is home to three of Sweden's World Heritage Sites ;– spots judged as invaluable places that belong to all of humanity: The Drottningholm Palace, Skogskyrkogården (The Woodland Cemetery) and Birka.&#91;28&#93;&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93; In 1998, Stockholm was named European Capital of Culture.
Authors connected to Stockholm include the poet and songwriter Carl Michael Bellman (1740–1795), novelist and dramatist August Strindberg (1849–1912), and novelist Hjalmar Söderberg (1869–1941), all of whom made Stockholm part of their works.
Martin Beck is a fictional Swedish police detective from Stockholm, who is the main character in a series of 10 novels by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, collectively titled The Story of a Crime, and often based in Stockholm.
Other authors with notable heritage in Stockholm were the Nobel Prize laureate Eyvind Johnson (1900–1976) and the popular poet and composer Evert Taube (1890–1976). The novelist Per Anders Fogelström (1917–1998) wrote a popular series of historical novels depicting life in Stockholm from the mid-18th to the mid-20th century.
The city's oldest section is Gamla stan (Old Town), located on the original small islands of the city's earliest settlements and still featuring the medieval street layout. Some notable buildings of Gamla Stan are the large German Church (Tyska kyrkan) and several mansions and palaces: the Riddarhuset (the House of Nobility), the Bonde Palace, the Tessin Palace and the Oxenstierna Palace.
The oldest building in Stockholm is the Riddarholmskyrkan from the late 13th century. After a fire in 1697 when the original medieval castle was destroyed, Stockholm Palace was erected in a baroque style. Storkyrkan Cathedral, the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Stockholm, stands next to the castle. It was founded in the 13th century but is clad in a baroque exterior dating to the 18th century.
As early as the 15th century, the city had expanded outside of its original borders. Some pre-industrial, small-scale buildings from this era can still be found in Södermalm. During the 19th century and the age of industrialization Stockholm grew rapidly, with plans and architecture inspired by the large cities of the continent such as Berlin and Vienna. Notable works of this time period include public buildings such as the Royal Swedish Opera and private developments such as the luxury housing developments on Strandvägen.
In the 20th century, a nationalistic push spurred a new architectural style inspired by medieval and renaissance ancestry as well as influences of the Jugend/Art Nouveau style. A key landmark of Stockholm, the Stockholm City Hall, was erected 1911–1923 by architect Ragnar Östberg. Other notable works of these times are the Stockholm Public Library and the World Heritage Site Skogskyrkogården.&#91;66&#93;
In the 1930s modernism characterized the development of the city as it grew. New residential areas sprang up such as the development on Gärdet while industrial development added to the growth, such as the KF manufacturing industries on Kvarnholmen located in the Nacka Municipality. In the 1950s, suburban development entered a new phase with the introduction of the Stockholm metro. The modernist developments of Vällingby and Farsta were internationally praised. In the 1960s this suburban development continued but with the aesthetic of the times, the industrialized and mass-produced blocks of flats received a large amount of criticism.
At the same time that this suburban development was taking place, the most central areas of the inner city were being redesigned, known as Norrmalmsregleringen. Sergels Torg, with its five high-rise office towers was created in the 1960s, followed by the total clearance of large areas to make room for new development projects. The most notable buildings from this period include the ensemble of the House of Culture, City Theatre and the Riksbank at Sergels Torg, designed by architect Peter Celsing.
In the 1980s, the planning ideas of modernism were starting to be questioned, resulting in suburbs with denser planning, such as Skarpnäck. In the 1990s this idea was taken further with the development of an old industrial area close to the inner city, resulting in a sort of mix of modernistic and urban planning&#91;clarification needed&#93; in the new area of Hammarby Sjöstad.
The municipality has appointed an official "board of beauty" called "Skönhetsrådet" to protect and preserve the beauty of the city.&#91;67&#93;
Stockholm's architecture (along with Visby, Gotland&#91;68&#93;) provided the inspiration for Japanese anime director Hayao Miyazaki as he sought to evoke an idealized city untouched by World War. His creation called Koriko, draws directly from what Miyazaki felt was Stockholm's sense of well-established architectural unity, vibrancy, independence, and safety.&#91;69&#93;
Stockholm is one of the most crowded museum-cities in the world with around 100 museums, visited by millions of people every year.&#91;70&#93;
The Vasa Museum (Swedish: Vasamuseet) is a maritime museum on Djurgården which displays the only almost fully intact 17th century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship Vasa that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628.
The Nationalmuseum houses the largest collection of art in the country: 16,000 paintings and 30,000 objects of art handicraft. The collection dates back to the days of Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, and has since been expanded with works by artists such as Rembrandt, and Antoine Watteau, as well as constituting a main part of Sweden's art heritage, manifested in the works of Alexander Roslin, Anders Zorn, Johan Tobias Sergel, Carl Larsson, Carl Fredrik Hill and Ernst Josephson. From the year 2013 to 2018 the museum was closed due to a restoration of the building.&#91;71&#93;
Moderna Museet (Museum of Modern Art) is Sweden's national museum of modern art. It has works by noted modern artists such as Picasso and Salvador Dalí.
Skansen (in English: the Sconce) is a combined open-air museum and zoo, located on the island of Djurgården. It was founded in 1891 by Artur Hazelius (1833–1901) to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era.
Other notable museums (in alphabetical order):
Stockholm has a vibrant art scene with a number of internationally recognized art centres and commercial galleries. Amongst others, privately sponsored initiatives such as Bonniers Konsthall, Magasin 3, and state-supported institutions such as Tensta Konsthall and Index all show leading international and national artists. In the last few years, a gallery district has emerged around Hudiksvallsgatan where leading galleries such as Andréhn-Schiptjenko, Brändström &amp; Stene have located. Other important commercial galleries include Nordenhake, Milliken Gallery and Galleri Magnus Karlsson.
The Stockholm suburbs are places with diverse cultural background. Some areas in the inner suburbs, including those of Skärholmen, Tensta, Jordbro, Fittja, Husby, Brandbergen, Rinkeby, Rissne, Kista, Hagsätra, Hässelby, Farsta, Rågsved, Flemingsberg, and the outer suburb of Södertälje, have high percentages of immigrants or second generation immigrants. These mainly come from the Middle East (Assyrians, Syriacs, Turks and Kurds) also Bosnians and Serbs, but there are also immigrants from Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93; Other parts of the inner suburbs, such as Täby, Danderyd, Lidingö, Flysta and, as well as some of the suburbs mentioned above, have a majority of ethnic Swedes.

Stockholm is one of the cleanest capitals in the world.&#91;79&#93; The city was granted the 2010 European Green Capital Award by the EU Commission; this was Europe's first "green capital".&#91;80&#93; Applicant cities were evaluated in several ways: climate change, local transport, public green areas, air quality, noise, waste, water consumption, waste water treatment, sustainable utilisation of land, biodiversity and environmental management.&#91;81&#93; Out of 35 participant cities, eight finalists were chosen: Stockholm, Amsterdam, Bristol, Copenhagen, Freiburg, Hamburg, Münster, and Oslo.&#91;82&#93; Some of the reasons why Stockholm won the 2010 European Green Capital Award were: its integrated administrative system, which ensures that environmental aspects are considered in budgets, operational planning, reporting, and monitoring; its cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 25% per capita in ten years; and its decision towards being fossil fuel free by 2050.&#91;81&#93; Stockholm has long demonstrated concern for the environment. The city's current environmental program is the fifth since the first one was established in the mid-1970s.&#91;83&#93; In 2011, Stockholm passed the title of European Green Capital to Hamburg, Germany.&#91;82&#93;
In the beginning of 2010, Stockholm launched the program Professional Study Visits&#91;84&#93; in order to share the city's green best practices. The program provides visitors with the opportunity to learn how to address issues such as waste management, urban planning, carbon dioxide emissions, and sustainable and efficient transportation system, among others.&#91;80&#93;
According to the European Cities Monitor 2010,&#91;85&#93; Stockholm is the best city in terms of freedom from pollution. Surrounded by 219 nature reserves, Stockholm has around 1,000 green spaces, which corresponds to 30% of the city's area.&#91;86&#93; Founded in 1995, the Royal National City Park is the world's first legally protected "national urban park".&#91;87&#93;&#91;88&#93; For a description of the formation process, value assets and implementation of the legal protection of The Royal National Urban Park, see Schantz 2006 The water in Stockholm is so clean that people can dive and fish in the centre of the city.&#91;86&#93; The waters of downtown Stockholm serve as spawning grounds for multiple fish species including trout and salmon, though human intervention is needed to keep populations up.&#91;89&#93; Regarding CO2 emissions, the government's target is that Stockholm will be CO2 free before 2050.&#91;86&#93;
Stockholm used to have problematic levels of particulates (PM10) due to studded winter tires, but as of 2016 the levels are below limits, after street-specific bans. Instead the current (2016) problem is nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles. In 2016 the average levels for urban background (roof of Torkel Knutssonsgatan) were: NO2 11 μg/m3, NOx 14 μg/m3, PM10 12 μg/m3, PM2.5 4.9 μg/m3, soot 0.4 μg/m3, ultrafine particles 6200/cm3, CO 0.2 ;mg/m3, SO2 0.4 μg/m3, ozone 51 μg/m3. For urban street level (the densely trafficked Hornsgatan) the average levels were: NO2 43 μg/m3, NOx 104 μg/m3, PM10 23 μg/m3, PM2.5 5.9 μg/m3, soot 1.0 μg/m3, ultrafine particles 17100/cm3, CO 0.3 ;mg/m3, ozone 31 μg/m3.&#91;90&#93;
Stockholm has an extensive public transport system. It consists of the Stockholm Metro (Swedish: Tunnelbanan), which consist of three color-coded main systems (green, red and blue) with seven lines (10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19); the Stockholm commuter rail (Swedish: Pendeltågen) which runs on the state-owned railroads on six lines (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48); four light rail/tramway lines (7, 12, 21, and 22); the 891 mm narrow-gauge railway Roslagsbanan, on three lines (27, 28, 29) in the northeastern part; the local railway Saltsjöbanan, on two lines (25, 26) in the southeastern part; a large number of bus lines, and the inner-city Djurgården ferry. The overwhelming majority of the land-based public transport in Stockholm County (save for the airport buses/airport express trains and other few commercially viable bus lines) is organized under the common umbrella of Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL), an aktiebolag wholly owned by Stockholm County Council. Since the 1990s, the operation and maintenance of the SL public transport services are contracted out to independent companies bidding for contracts, such as MTR, which currently operate the Metro. The archipelago boat traffic is handled by Waxholmsbolaget, which is also wholly owned by the County Council.
SL has a common ticket system in the entire Stockholm County, which allows for easy travel between different modes of transport. The tickets are of two main types, single ticket and travel cards, both allowing for unlimited travel with SL in the entire Stockholm County for the duration of the ticket validity. On 1 April 2007, a zone system (A, B, C) and price system was introduced. Single tickets were available in forms of cash ticket, individual unit pre-paid tickets, pre-paid ticket slips of 8, sms-ticket and machine ticket. Cash tickets bought at the point of travel were the most expensive and pre-paid tickets slips of 8 are the cheapest. A single ticket costs 32 SEK with the card and 45 SEK without and is valid for 75 minutes. The duration of the travel card validity depended on the exact type; they were available from 24 hours up to a year. As of 2018, a 30-day card costs 860 ;SEK. Tickets of all these types were available with reduced prices for students and persons under 20 and over 65 years of age. On 9 January 2017, the zone system was removed, and the cost of the tickets was increased.&#91;91&#93;
With an estimated cost of SEK 16.8 ;billion (January 2007 price level), which equals 2.44 ;billion US dollars, the City Line, an environmentally certified project, comprises a 6 ;km (3.7 ;mi)-long commuter train tunnel (in rock and water) beneath Stockholm, with two new stations (Stockholm City and Stockholm Odenplan), and a 1.4 ;km (0.87 ;mi)-long railway bridge at Årsta. The City Line was built by the Swedish Transport Administration in co-operation with the City of Stockholm, Stockholm County Council, and Stockholm Transport, SL. As Stockholm Central Station is overloaded, the purpose of this project was to double the city's track capacity and improve service efficiency. Operations began in July 2017.&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93;
Between Riddarholmen and Söder Mälarstrand, the City Line runs through a submerged concrete tunnel.&#91;92&#93; As a green project, the City Line includes the purification of waste water; noise reduction through sound-attenuating tracks; the use of synthetic diesel, which provides users with clean air; and the recycling of excavated rocks.&#91;92&#93;
Stockholm is at the junction of the European routes E4, E18 and E20. A half-completed motorway ring road exists on the south, west and north sides of the City Centre. The northern section of the ring road, Norra Länken, opened for traffic in 2015 while the final subsea eastern section is being discussed as a future project. A bypass motorway for traffic between Northern and Southern Sweden, Förbifart Stockholm, is currently being built. The many islands and waterways make extensions of the road system both complicated and expensive, and new motorways are often built as systems of tunnels and bridges.
Stockholm has a congestion pricing system, Stockholm congestion tax,&#91;94&#93; in use on a permanent basis since 1 August 2007,&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93; after having had a seven-month trial period in the first half of 2006.&#91;97&#93; The City Centre is within the congestion tax zone. All the entrances and exits of this area have unmanned control points operating with automatic number plate recognition. All vehicles entering or exiting the congestion tax affected area, with a few exceptions, have to pay 10–20 ;SEK (1.09–2.18 ;EUR, 1.49–2.98 ;USD) depending on the time of day between 06:30 and 18:29. The maximum tax amount per vehicle per day is 60 ;SEK (6.53 ;EUR, ).&#91;98&#93; Payment is done by various means within 14 days after one has passed one of the control points; one cannot pay at the control points.&#91;99&#93;
After the trial period was over, consultative referendums were held in Stockholm Municipality and several other municipalities in Stockholm County. The then-reigning government (Persson Cabinet) stated that they would only take into consideration the results of the referendum in Stockholm Municipality. The opposition parties (Alliance for Sweden) stated that if they were to form a cabinet after the general election—which was held the same day as the congestion tax referendums—they would take into consideration the referendums held in several of the other municipalities in Stockholm County as well. The results of the referendums were that the Stockholm Municipality voted for the congestion tax, while the other municipalities voted against it. The opposition parties won the general election and a few days before they formed government (Reinfeldt Cabinet) they announced that the congestion tax would be reintroduced in Stockholm, but that the revenue would go entirely to road construction in and around Stockholm. During the trial period and according to the agenda of the previous government the revenue went entirely to public transport.
Stockholm has regular ferry lines to Helsinki and Turku in Finland (commonly called "Finlandsfärjan"); Tallinn, Estonia; Riga, Latvia, Åland islands and to Saint Petersburg. The large Stockholm archipelago is served by the archipelago boats of Waxholmsbolaget (owned and subsidized by Stockholm County Council).
Between April and October, during the warmer months, it is possible to rent Stockholm City Bikes by purchasing a bike card online or through retailers.&#91;100&#93; Cards allow users to rent bikes from any Stockholm City Bikes stand spread across the city and return them in any stand.&#91;101&#93; There are two types of cards: the Season Card (valid from 1 April to 31 October) and the 3-day card. When their validity runs out they can be reactivated and are therefore reusable.&#91;102&#93; Bikes can be used for up to three hours per loan and can be rented from Monday to Sunday from 6 am to 10 pm.&#91;101&#93;
Additionally, there are also bus lines, Flygbussarna, that run between central Stockholm and all the airports.
As of 2010&#91;update&#93; there are no airports specifically for general aviation in the Stockholm area.
Stockholm Central Station has train connections to many Swedish cities as well as to Oslo, Norway and Copenhagen, Denmark. The popular X 2000 service to Gothenburg takes three hours. Most of the trains are run by SJ AB.
Stockholm often performs well in international rankings, some of which are mentioned below:

Ombre (from&#32;Spanish&#32; hombre, meaning 'man'&#91;1&#93;) or l'Hombre is a fast-moving seventeenth-century trick-taking card game for three players.
Its history began in Spain around the end of the 16th century as a four-person game.&#91;2&#93; It is one of the earliest card games known in Europe and by far the most classic game of its type, directly ancestral to Euchre, Boston and Solo Whist.&#91;3&#93; Despite its difficult rules, complicated point score and strange foreign terms, it swept Europe in the last quarter of the 17th century, becoming Lomber in Germany, Lumbur in Austria and Ombre (originally pronounced 'umber'&#91;4&#93;) in England, occupying a position of prestige similar to contract bridge today. Although little played today, Ombre or l'Hombre has been assessed as "the most successful card game ever invented."&#91;5&#93;
The historical importance of Ombre in the field of playing cards is the fact that it was the first card game in which a trump suit was established by bidding rather than by the random process of turning the first card of the stock. This game developed from Triunfo, though it was from L'Hombre that the idea of bidding was adopted into other card games such as Skat, and Tarot, which owes Hombre a good portion of its betting system as well.
Ombre's precise origins are unknown, but it reached England and France at about the same time. The earliest French reference dates to 1671 and it is recorded in England as early as 1661 with a set of rules being published in 1662.&#91;6&#93; The game continued to be in vogue in almost every corner of Europe from the late 17th through the 18th centuries.
As with most games, Ombre acquired many variations of increasing complexity over the years, until its popularity was eclipsed by the second quarter of the 18th century by a new four player French variant called Quadrille, later displaced by the English Whist. Other lines of descent and hybridization produced games like Preference, Mediator and Twenty-five. Under the name Tresillo, it survived in parts of Spain during the nineteenth century, as Voltarete in Portugal and Brazil, as Rocambor in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia in the twentieth century, and it is still played as L’Hombre in Denmark, mostly in Jutland and on the island of Funen, where it is organized by the L'Hombre Union.
Daines Barrington, English antiquary and naturalist, says that Ombre was probably introduced in England by Catherine of Braganza, the Queen of Charles II, as Edmund Waller, the court poet, had a poem entitled "On a Card Torn at Ombre by the Queen".&#91;7&#93; She was such a keen player, as were so many members of English high society by the end of 1674, that the Lower House of Parliament proposed to pass an Act against the playing of Ombre, or at least to limit the stakes at £5, a proposition received as "ridiculous" at that time.&#91;8&#93; But a small book of rules, The Royal game of the ombre written at the request of divers honourable persons, published in London in 1660, would support the inference that the game was known in England before the Restoration.
Ombre takes its name from the Spanish phrase originally used by the player who declared trumps: Yo soy el hombre, i.e., "I am the man". It appears to be merely an alteration of the game Primero and it is to be presumed that it was invented prior to the publication of the Dictionary of Sebastián de Covarrubias in 1611, although it makes no mention of it.&#91;9&#93;
Cotton's Compleat Gamester says that “there were several sorts of this game, but that which the chief was called "Renegado", at which three only could play, and to whom were dealt nine cards apiece so that by discarding the eights, nines and tens, there would remain thirteen cards in the stock". Seymour's The Compleat Gamester (1722) contains a frontispiece representing a party of rank playing it and describes it as a game so much in fashion that at its peak by the turn of the eighteenth century it inspired a unique form of furniture: a three-sided card table. According to Jean-Baptiste Bullet, writer and professor of divinity at the University of Besançon,&#91;10&#93; the Spaniards, occasionally also called the game "Manilla" after the name of the second matador, a word signifying a slayer in Spanish.
The game of Ombre is Belinda's game in  Alexander Pope's poem The Rape of the Lock, written in 1714.&#91;n 1&#93; The progress of the game is described in such detail that Lord Aldenham was able to reconstruct the exact deal and play of the cards.&#91;11&#93;
It is also mentioned in Alexander Pushkin's Eugene Onegin.&#91;non-primary source needed&#93;
Ombre is a three-handed game in which a single player, originally known as Ombre or l'Hombre (the man), plays against his two opponents. The game is traditionally played with a forty-card Spanish-suited deck with suits of coins and cups (round) and swords and clubs (long),&#91;12&#93; but when it spread to Northern Europe French-suited cards with suits of diamonds and hearts (red) and spades and clubs (black) were usually substituted.
Once the cards are dealt, players bid for the right to choose what suit will be trumps. The trump maker (Ombre) undertakes to win more tricks than either of the other players, and wins the pool if successful. If an opponent of the Ombre wins the most tricks the Ombre pays that opponent. If there is a tie for most tricks the Ombre pays into the pool. There are additional payments for various feats such as winning all the tricks (Vole).
By the 17th century, when it caught on outside Spain, most people were playing a three-player variation called "Renegado" first described in 1663 in Madrid.&#91;13&#93; The terms used were those in English, which were anglicized versions of French versions of the original Spanish words.
Traditionally, a Spanish 40-card deck is used, but a French-suited deck may be substituted in which case spades correspond to swords, clubs to clubs, hearts to cups and diamonds to coins. The eights, nines and tens can be stripped out of a standard 52-card deck to make a suitable 40-card deck.
The rank of the cards in the game depends on whether a black (long) or a red (round) suit is chosen as trumps. The basic ranking of numerals is reversed in red suits, being 7 low; and a red suit is always one card longer than a black one of the same status, whether trump or plain.
The black aces are permanent trumps, and the top three trumps are called matadors or estuches:
When a red suit is trumps, the fourth highest trump is the A♥, or A♦, called "punto", but it does not have the status of a matador.
Whoever draws the highest card from the deck becomes the dealer; the turn to deal and play rotates counter-clockwise. Before play, the dealer antes five chips to the pool, deals nine cards in batches of three, and places the remaining thirteen face down on the playing surface to form the stock, or talon.
Whoever bids highest becomes Ombre, chooses trumps, and seeks to win more tricks than either opponent individually. Thus, five or more wins, and four wins if the others split three-two. The possible bids are, from low to high:
In turn, each player may pass or bid, and having passed cannot bid again. Each bid must be higher than the last. However, a player who has made a lower bid, and not yet passed, may raise his bid to equal that of the previous player, unless overcalled again. Unless playing Solo, Ombre may make as many discards as he likes before drawing the same number from the stock. Solo or not, both opponents may then discard and draw for themselves. As it is advantageous for one of the defenders to have the stronger hand, they may agree as to which is to exchange first. Whoever does so may draw any number of cards up to eight. Rules vary considerably as to whether any untaken cards are left down or turned face up, and the point should be agreed before play.
Eldest leads first and the winner of each trick leads to the next. The trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led or by the highest trump if any are played. Normally, suit must be followed if possible, otherwise any card may be played. Matadors, however, can only be forced by higher matadors, not by lower ones or trumps. That is, if the player's only trumps are matadors he need not follow to a trump, but may discard ("Renege") instead. However, if a higher matador is led, and his only trump is a lower one, he is obliged to play it.
If Ombre takes the first five tricks straight off, he can claim the game won without need for further play. If instead he leads to the sixth, he thereby obligates himself to win all nine ("Vole"), thus increasing his potential winnings or penalties. If Ombre thinks he cannot win, he may surrender at any time before playing to the fourth trick, but he may not do this if playing a "Solo". In a "Vuelta", his surrender must be accepted by both opponents. However, if the game played was “Entrada”, either opponent may himself take over the role of Ombre and play the rest of the hand as if he had made the bid himself.
There are three possible outcomes, which are:
If the Ombre wins, in addition to collecting the pool he is paid by each opponent.
If Ombre loses “Puesta”, he doubles the pool and pays five chips for each player in the game. If Ombre loses “Codille”, he pays the same as for a “Puesta”, but to the player who won instead of to the pot. These penalties are further increased as described above for “Primeras”, and if he loses the first five tricks, and “Estuches”, he pays one per each consecutive trump. If Ombre fails to win all nine tricks after leading to the sixth, he pays 30 to each opponent, less 2 if he played “Vuelta”, and 10 if he played Solo, less also the number of “Estuches” applicable.
If all pass immediately, lower bids may be made so as to avoid a redeal. They include:
Vole, Contrabola: No one discards, Hombre announces a trump suit of which he holds at least one, and aims to lose every trick. If successful, he wins as if the game was “Entrada”, if not it counts as “Puesta”.
Spadille Forcé, Force Spadille: if all pass without bidding, whoever holds “Spadille” or “Basto”, must take the role as Ombre, or by eldest if no one does. He discards up to 8 cards, draws replacements from the stock and then announces trumps. The game counts as “Entrada”.
Ombre may be played sometimes by two players, for lack of a third person. It is played exactly as for three hands, but a whole suit is removed from the pack, either Diamonds or Hearts, so that 30 cards remain. Deal eight cards in batches of 2's and stock the remaining 12 on the table. Ombre may take as many cards as he wants up to eight and the other player may take the rest. When the trump is named, the player is paid for Matadors.  Ombre is intended to make five tricks to win the stake.  If the tricks are divided by four, the game is then considered "Remise". If the other player makes five, he wins by "Codille".
In this variation, first described in 1669 in Zaragossa,&#91;13&#93; usually only three players are active at a time. The player opposite the dealer sits out, but takes part in the payment after the play as though he were a defender. If three players pass, the fourth player picks up all 13 cards from the stock and discards four. He chooses trump then and plays as declarer against the other three, who cannot exchange any cards, since the stock is already used up. The contract counts as “Entrada”.
In this five-handed variation called Cinquillo, first described around 1683,&#91;13&#93; the players are dealt eight cards each, after staking down a fifth to the pool, therefore no discard is possible. Bidding may be for Ask Leave, when Ombre calls a king seeking for a partner. If the first four players pass, the fifth may play Solo. Ombre is obliged to win five tricks, otherwise he loses. He names trump and if between them five tricks can be won, Ombre wins, sharing between them two third of the pool for Ombre and one third for his partner. If they both make only three tricks the game is Remise, and Ombre is to lay down two thirds of the pool and his partner one.

Brøndums Hotel, in the little harbor town of Skagen in the north of Denmark, is remembered for its close associations with the late 19th-century artists colony known as the Skagen Painters. It still operates as a hotel today.
The hotel originated in a farmhouse which Ane Kirstine Houmann (1785–1858) had inherited from her stepfather Chresten Jensen Degn (1760–1839). After the death of her husband Anders Eriksen Brøndum  (1781-1835), her son Erik Andersen Brøndum (1820–1890) helped her to run the grocery shop and guest house which she established in the old farmhouse. Erik and his wife Anne Hedvig Sørensdatter Møller (1826–1916) later ran the business together until it was taken over by their son Christen Degn Brøndum (1856–1932) who converted it into guest rooms and in 1891 gave it the name of Brondums Hotel. Their daughter, the painter Anna Ancher (1859–1935) was born in the hotel.&#91;1&#93;
The architect Ulrik Plesner was called upon to expand the hotel in 1892.&#91;2&#93; It was further expanded in 1909 and 1916, latterly with an extension known as Admiralgården. The interior of the dining-room was designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll in 1906.&#91;2&#93; The hotel was run by Degn Brøndum until his death in 1932 when he left it to Skagens Museum. The hotel was damaged by fire in 1954 and 1959. Repairs together with the cost of modernization after the Second World War brought the concern into debt and led to its sale in 1966.&#91;1&#93;
The Skagen Painters had close associations with Brøndums Hotel. Michael Ancher arrived in Skagen in 1874 where he struck up a close relationship with the Brøndoms, marrying their daughter Anna in 1880. He encouraged his friends Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen to join him in 1875. More artists followed, many staying in the Brøndums' guest house. Key members of the group included the author Georg Brandes and the painter P.S. Krøyer, their unofficial leader The Brøndums' dining-room became the centre of the artists' social life and was filled with the paintings they donated to cover the cost of board and lodging.&#91;3&#93;

Skagen (/ˈskæɡən/, Danish: ;[ˈskɛˀjn̩]) is Denmark's northernmost town, on the east coast of the Skagen Odde peninsula in the far north of Jutland, part of Frederikshavn Municipality in Nordjylland, 41 kilometres (25 ;mi) north of Frederikshavn and 108 kilometres (67 ;mi) northeast of Aalborg. The Port of Skagen is Denmark's main fishing port and it also has a thriving tourist industry, attracting 2 ;million people annually.
The name was applied originally to the peninsula but it now also refers to the town. The settlement began during the Middle Ages as a fishing village, renowned for its herring industry. Thanks to its seascapes, fishermen and evening light, towards the end of the 19th century it became popular with a group of impressionist artists now known as the Skagen Painters. In 1879, the Skagen Fishermen's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the Skagensbanen railway, which opened as a narrow-gauged railway in 1890. The modern port of Skagen opened on 20 November 1907, and with the railway connections to Frederikshavn and the rest of Denmark, tourism began to develop.
During the early 1910s, Christian X and Queen Alexandrine often visited Skagen and brought friends from other European monarchies. They built a summer residence, Klitgaarden, completed in 1914.
Between the 1930s and 1950s the town grew rapidly, with the population more than doubling from 4,048 in 1930 to 9,009 in 1955. Skagen reached a maximum population of 14,050 in 1980, after which it gradually declined. As of 1 January 2019 it has a population of 8,003. Thanks to the artistic community which still remains in Skagen, the local arts and crafts trade remains important to the income of the town with its numerous crafts shops and galleries. Chains such as the international jeweller Skagen Designs have branches in the town, and given the abundance of fresh fish coming in at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple in Skagen's restaurants.
St Lawrence's Church was built just outside the village at the end of the 14th century, but after it was buried in drifting sand it was replaced by Skagen Church in 1841 designed by Christian Frederik Hansen. It was redeveloped in 1909–10 by Ulrik Plesner who also designed a number of other buildings in Skagen, including Klitgaarden and the railway station. Several landmarks in the town are closely associated with the Skagen Painters who used to frequent them, including Brøndums Hotel, Skagens Museum, Michael and Anna Ancher's House, and Drachmann's House.
Skagen's first school was the Latinskole, a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen, and in 1921, Skagen's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships, and in 1955, the public school Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej. The main gymnasium of the town, Skagen Kultur- og Fritidscenter, opened in 1972, and was later expanded with an aquatic centre and a number of smaller training facilities. Skagen's Sportscenter was completed in 1974, primarily to accommodate badminton and tennis. The local football club, Skagen Idræts Klub, was founded in 1946 and reached the Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in Danish football, as their best position. The Hvide Klit Golf Club is 17 ;km (11 ;mi) south of the town.
Skagen station is the most northerly railway station in Denmark and is the terminus of the Skagensbanen. Nordjyske Jernbaner operates the local train service between Skagen, Frederikshavn and Aalborg with onward national connections by DSB. From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to Gothenburg, Oslo and Læsø. Aalborg Airport is 100 ;km (62 ;mi) southwest of Skagen.
Skagen was mentioned as far back as the first century AD by Pliny the Elder:
This is the only time the name Tastris is mentioned but Skagen itself, first documented as Skaffuen in 1284, simply means narrow, high point of land&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;
The first building in the area, dating from the 12th century, was in Højen on the west side of the peninsula. It belonged to Tronder, a shepherd who also became Skagen's first fisherman. Around 1340, Vesterby, on the east coast (to the south west of today's harbour), developed into the main village. Further to the south west, St Lawrence's Church was built at the end of the 14th century. In 1413, Erik of Pommern granted Skagen the status of market town with the result that for a time it became Vendsyssel's largest community with up to 2,000 inhabitants.&#91;4&#93;
In 1549 a grammar school was opened (closing again in 1739), and in 1561 Skagen's first lighthouse was constructed. In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked off the coast of Skagen.&#91;4&#93; In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away.&#91;4&#93; In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in drifting sand.&#91;4&#93; As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.
In the 17th century, fishing suffered from a decline in herring stocks. Shortly after the beginning of the Torstensson War, the Swedish army arrived in Skagen in January 1644, plundering the town.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;  Skagen's White Lighthouse with adjoining accommodation for the keeper was built in 1747. In 1775, accumulations of drifting sand made it difficult to access St Lawrence's Church, finally leading to its closure and partial demolition in 1795. Its remaining artefacts were sold by auction in 1810. St Lawrence's was replaced by Skagen Church, completed in 1841 and redesigned in the local style by Ulrik Plesner in 1910.&#91;4&#93;
On a single day in 1825, 23 ships were left stranded off the coast.&#91;4&#93; In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, almost half a century before the arrival of the Skagen Painters.&#91;6&#93; Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844.&#91;4&#93; In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.&#91;4&#93;
Hans Christian Andersen visited the town in 1859. During his stay at Brøndums Hotel, the future painter Anna Ancher, daughter of the inn-keeper, was born.&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; In 1871, the author Holger Drachmann and the painters Fritz Thaulow and Karl Madsen arrived in Skagen, the first of the colony of artists which became known as the Skagen Painters. They were followed by Carl Locher in 1872, Michael Ancher in 1874 and Peder Severin Krøyer in 1882.&#91;4&#93;   
In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was established with the purpose of facilitating the local fishing industry through the railway.&#91;9&#93; In 1890, the Skagensbanen narrow-gauge railway from Frederikshavn finally arrived in Skagen, connecting the town to the rest of Denmark.&#91;10&#93; The tracks were widened in 1916 to avoid the need to transfer cargoes of fish in Frederikshavn. Many of the town's typical yellow-plastered houses with red roofs which grew up along Sankt Laurentii Vej from 1890 to 1930 were designed by Ulrik Plesner. He was also the architect behind many other buildings in the town, including the railway station, Brøndums Hotel and Skagen Museum. Skagen Missionshus was opened in 1896.&#91;4&#93;
In 1904–7, the fishing harbour was built with inner and outer sections under the patronage of hydraulic engineer Palle Bruun. It was inaugurated on 20 November 1907,&#91;9&#93; and later additions were made for cold storage and the fish processing industry. The distinctive warehouses next to the harbour were designed by Thorvald Bindesbøll.
In the early 1910s, Christian X and Queen Alexandrine often visited Skagen in the royal yacht Kongeskibet Dannebrog. Occasionally they arrived by train and brought friends from other European monarchies and stayed at the Brøndums and Grenen hotels. They grew fond of the place, befriending many of the artists in Skagen.&#91;11&#93; Christian X bought up land in the vicinity and built the summer residence Klitgaarden as a gift for his wife. Designed by Ulrik Plesner, with furniture provided by Marie Krøyer, the villa was inaugurated on 11 April 1914, with the town celebrating the royal opening with many flags.&#91;12&#93; Klitgaarden was further embellished inside by local artists. It passed to Prince Knud and Princess Caroline Mathilde, and after Caroline's death in 1995, it was converted into a villa retreat for scholars in 2000.&#91;12&#93; Composer Carl Nielsen also frequented Skagen in his youth, and he purchased a plot of land on Vestre Strandvej at Vesterby in 1918 with his sculptor wife Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, using one of the two small half-timbered houses there as a residence and studio.&#91;12&#93; They named it "Finis Terrae", meaning "end of the world". The Nielsen family owned the property until 1957 when they sold it to Frode Jensen, a machinery manufacturer.&#91;12&#93; 
In the 1930s, development of the town as a tourist attraction led to the opening of new hotels. In 1931, the residents of Skagen and their famous friends campaigned for a monument to be established on the square in the town, commemorating the fishermen and lifeboatmen of Jutland. Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen was commissioned to erect a 3 metres (9.8 ;ft) bronze statue of a lifeboatman in garb, holding a lifeline.&#91;13&#93; The monument was showcased at the Free Exhibition Hall in Copenhagen in the spring of 1931, before fundraising enabled it to be brought by sea to Skagen on 10 November 1932.&#91;13&#93; In October 1938, lightning struck the Skagens Badehotel, affecting the wing with the salons and music rooms. During World War II, the hotel was taken over by the Germans, until it was demolished in 1943.&#91;9&#93; Further facilities were developed in the 1950s. From the 1960s, housing estates were constructed to the north, forming a built-up area extending to Højen. Anna and Michael Ancher's house was opened as a museum (1967) and the new town hall was completed in 1969.&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; The Skagen Festival was founded in 1971, making it the oldest music festival in the country. The primary genre is folk music. In 1977, Drachmanns House was broken into and four paintings were stolen, and then in 1980, a painting by Christian Krohg was stolen from Skagens Museum.&#91;4&#93;
Several fires and industrial incidents occurred in the 1980s. In 1981, an oil slick affected the coastline of Skagen municipality, and in 1985 a pipe bomb exploded at Ankermedet School. Skagen ice factory was affected by a chemical incident in 1989.&#91;4&#93; A new shrimp factory opened in the industrial area in 1991, while the local cinema was closed in 1993. There was a major fire on the Hulsig Heath dunes in 1996.&#91;4&#93;
The Skagen Painters were a group of Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until the turn of the century. They were attracted by the scenery, the fishermen and the social community of their fellow artists which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.&#91;14&#93;
The group was reputed to have adopted a bohemian lifestyle. It encompassed not only painters, but also writers, and other influential people. While only a few were full-time residents of the area, they were often joined by family and friends, especially during the summer months. The group initially revolved around Michael Ancher and his wife to be Anna, the only member of the group who was a native of Skagen. P.S. Krøyer, who arrived in 1882, was perhaps the most colourful member of the group.&#91;15&#93; His painting Hip, Hip, Hurrah! shows several of the artists celebrating around a table out in the garden. The painters included the Swedes Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén, the Norwegians Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen, and the Danes Karl Madsen, Laurits Tuxen, Marie Triepcke Krøyer Alfvén, Carl Locher, Viggo Johansen and Thorvald Niss.  The group also included the writers Holger Drachmann, Georg Brandes and Henrik Pontoppidan and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén. They often gathered in Brøndums Hotel whose dining room now forms part of Skagens Museum.&#91;14&#93;
In 1890, the railway to Skagen not only led to the expansion of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists' colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901, Holger Drachmann in 1903.&#91;16&#93; Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, continued to visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum's has a large collection of works from all the recognized artists who painted in Skagen.&#91;17&#93;
Skagen is Denmark's northernmost town, located 41 kilometres (25 ;mi) north of Frederikshavn, 108 kilometres (67 ;mi) northeast of Aalborg, and 226 kilometres (140 ;mi) northeast of Aarhus by road.&#91;18&#93; It takes its name from the  peninsula which projects into the waters between the North Sea and the straits of Denmark. The oldest areas lie along the south coast. Gammel Skagen (Old Skagen), also known as Højen, is located next to Nordstrand on the western side. Vesterby and Østerby are notable for their little fishermen's cottages and narrow streets.&#91;3&#93; Danish national road 40 to Frederikshavn passes through Skagen.&#91;19&#93;
Skagen is the place in Denmark where the most bird species can be experienced, a total of 367 out of 471 bird species in the country.(2017)&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93;
Year round the area around Skagen, especially Grenen, is visited by hundreds of birdwatchers from all over Denmark, particularly in April–May and the beginning of June and to a lesser degree in August–November. Furthermore, the area is visited by birdwatchers from Sweden, Norway and Germany.
Other well-visited locations for birdwatchers are Ellekrattet, Nordstrand (near Batterivej), Skagen Harbour, Flagbakken southwest of the town as well as horse fields and brushwood near Fyrvej, Bøjlevejen and Buttervej.
Every day all year round Skagen Bird Observatory observes the migration on Grenen from the highest sand dune located between the parking lot and Grenen: "The World's End".
Volunteers at Skagen Bird Observatory ring thousands of small birds in the Skagen area every year with permission from the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen.
Being surrounded by the sea in three directions, Skagen has a cool oceanic climate with a lack of temperature extremes.&#91;24&#93; Its maritime and moderated characteristics is shared with the rest of the country. Skagen is Denmark's sunniest town with an average of 233 hours of sunshine in the holiday month of July, higher than the 222 hours recorded for Bornholm's Østerlars.&#91;25&#93;
The population of Skagen has mostly grown steadily, reaching a peak of 14,050 people in 1980, but has shown a marked decline in the 21st century. In 1672 Skagen had a population of 1,004, but by 1781 this had declined to 650.&#91;4&#93; The 1801 population of 834 began to grow significantly in subsequent decades, reaching 1,052 people in 1824 and jumping to 1,632 by 1840.&#91;4&#93; By 1850, however, it had dropped to 1,400, after which is again began to grow steadily. Major growth occurred in the 1870s and 1880s, with the population growing from 1,615 in 1870 to 1,954 in 1880 and 2,323 inhabitants in 1890.&#91;4&#93; Several of the new inhabitants were artists, who significantly altered the ethnic composition of Skagen, as they brought their friends and families from abroad to join the colony at Skagen. Noticeable change occurred between 1901 and 1906, when the population grew from 2,438 to 2,936, and again in the late 1910s, growing from 3,212 in 1916 to 3,854 in 1921.&#91;4&#93; Major growth began to take place in the 1930s and 1940s in Skagen which grew  from 4,048 inhabitants in 1930 to 5,358 in 1940. Skagen's population more than doubled between 1930 and 1955 when it reached a population of 9,009.&#91;4&#93; By 1960, Skagen had 10,213 inhabitants, growing to 11,253 in 1965. Following a municipal merger in 1971, the population jumped from 11,749 to 13,513.&#91;4&#93; Thereafter the population grew very steadily, reaching a peak of 14,050 in 1980.  There has since been a steady decline, with 13,724 people recorded in 1990, 13,298 in 1994, and 12,691 in 2000.&#91;4&#93; In the 2000s, the permanent population of Skagen has shown a marked decline, falling from 12,213 in 2003&#91;4&#93; to 8,088 inhabitants in 2017.&#91;28&#93;
For generations, Skagen's economy has been based on its fishing industry which continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest fish oil factory. The town's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at dawn in the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.&#91;29&#93;
Tourism has now become the town's main industry. Initially attracted by its associations with the Skagen Painters, well-to-do visitors sought to benefit from its special light, colour and its fishermen. Their interest led to new hotels, summer houses and expensive villas. The old fishing village was transformed into a miniature city with fine streets lined with boutiques. From the 1960s, it became increasingly fashionable for the upper-classes to spend their summers in Skagen.&#91;30&#93;
Galleries selling local art and reproductions of Skagen's most iconic paintings have spread across the town, making it one of the places in Denmark with most galleries. Thanks to the town's growing reputation, sailing enthusiasts from Norway, Sweden and Denmark are now also among its frequent visitors. The quality brand name of Skagen has spread far afield, resulting in the establishment of the successful American watch company Skagen Designs which "set out to create a design driven company centred around the welcoming spirit of the city".&#91;31&#93; Currently a new tourist initiative "The Top of Denmark" targets Skagen as a year-round attraction, not just a summer resort.&#91;30&#93; The harbour is also being adapted to accommodate large international cruise ships. A new 450-meter berth will be completed by 2015 while the existing 170-meter berth will be extended to 200 meters.&#91;32&#93; Skagen now attracts some 2 ;million visitors a year to its hotels, restaurants, shops and galleries, making tourism a major source of income and employment.&#91;33&#93; An annual attraction is the Skagen Festival, Denmark's oldest music festival, which is held the first weekend of July at various venues in Skagen and the harbour area.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93; The largest campsite in the Skagen area is Grenen Camping, situated about 1.5 kilometres (0.93 ;mi) northeast of the centre, adjacent to the beach.&#91;36&#93;
Until 2007, Skagen was a municipality in its own right with a substantial local administration. With the reforms of 2007, it became part of Frederikshavn Municipality with a resulting loss in administrative jobs.&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93; The Bank of Skagen was established in 1862, and in 1865 a telegraph station was established in the town.&#91;4&#93; The pharmacy opened in 1904, a hospital in 1916, and telephone services were automated in 1956.&#91;4&#93; Ankermedet School was established in 1955. Recently, Skagen has seen developments in the offshore sector with an initiative to assist the Norwegian market through the establishment of Skagen Offshorepark in 2012.&#91;39&#93; On the shipbuilding front, Karstensens Skibsværft continues to prosper with orders for trawlers from Norway.&#91;40&#93;
Currently the harbour is being enlarged in order to accommodate larger vessels, especially cruise ships. From 2015 the enlarged harbour is expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present. The new harbour should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the harbour from 2,000 today to some 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and fish oil.&#91;41&#93;
Thanks to Skagen's reputation as an artistic community, the local arts and crafts trade is also an important source of income and employment. Artwork and handicrafts are sold in galleries such as the Galerie Skagen on Trondsvej. Sankt Laurentii Vej, one of the main streets away from the harbour area in Skagen,&#91;42&#93; is a known for its glass and pottery shops; of particular note are Skagen Glasvaerksted, which produces some of "Jutland's finest glass pieces", and Skagen Potteri.&#91;43&#93; In addition to its arts and crafts stores, the town has a wide range of shops,&#91;44&#93; including jewellery, clothes and shoes, handbags, souvenirs, flowers and gardening equipment. There are also a variety of food stores with butchers, bakers, a cheese shop, fishmongers, and several restaurants and cafés.&#91;45&#93; Skagen has a 1,000 square metres (11,000 ;sq ;ft) branch of the EuroSpar supermarket, opened in 1998.&#91;46&#93; Skagen Cementstøberi A/S is a local cement firm which produces concrete, paving stones, tiles, granite and other items.&#91;47&#93;
Given the abundance of fresh fish coming it at the port of Skagen, seafood forms a staple of cuisine in Skagen. Of particular note is the Skagen Fiske Restaurant, one of the most renowned seafood restaurants in Jutland which was established in 1907 at the side of the harbour. It serves shrimp, herring, grilled fillets of sole with lemon sauce and Norwegian lobster.&#91;48&#93; Ruth's Gourmet in Ruth's Hotel on Hans Ruth Vej is also of note and has been cited to be one of the top five restaurants in Denmark outside of Copenhagen, serving French cuisine under head chef Michel Michaud.&#91;48&#93; Ruths Hotel was originally built by Emma and Hans Christian Ruth in 1904 as a bath and guest house. It was purchased by J. Philip-Sørensen in 2003.&#91;49&#93; The Restaurant Pakhuset, the restaurant of the Brøndums Hotel, and Jakobs Café are also popular; Jakobs Café is a music venue and bar at night.&#91;36&#93; True foodies are also bound to visit the famous butcher, Slagter Munch, who is known for their sausages and for their ham: Skagen Skinken.&#91;50&#93;
At the headland at Grenen, commonly but erroneously believed to be the northernmost point of Denmark, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea meet. Because of their different densities, a clear dividing line can be seen. As a result of turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common.&#91;51&#93; These frequent losses combined with the town's strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark's earliest lighthouses, Vippefyr, a lever light constructed in 1627. A faithful copy has now been constructed on the site of the original.&#91;52&#93;
The White Lighthouse (det Hvide fyr) just north of the town is Denmark's oldest brick-built lighthouse. With a height of 21 ;m (69 ;ft), it was designed by Philip de Lange and lit for the first time in 1747. In 1858, it was replaced by the Grey Lighthouse (det Grå fyr) 2 ;km further north. Restored in 1960, the White Lighthouse now houses art exhibitions.&#91;53&#93;
Towards the end of the 19th century, Skagen became the summer venue of a group of artists who were attracted by the way of life in the fishing village and by the opportunities for painting the fishermen and surrounding landscapes.&#91;57&#93; Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, who was the proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and brother of Anna Ancher. In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989.&#91;57&#93; Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,900 works of art at its disposal.&#91;58&#93;
The former residence of the two painters Anna and Michael Ancher dates from 1884 and was expanded with a studio designed by Ulrik Plesner in 1913. Their only child, Helga Ancher, who died in 1964, left the property to a foundation for conversion into a museum. Opened to the public  in 1967, the house contains much of the original furniture, preserving the atmosphere of the artists' home. Together with the adjacent 18th-century Saxild House (Saxilds Gaard), it displays many of the Anchers' paintings as well as those of their artist friends. Saxild House hosts exhibitions and a museum café&#91;59&#93;
Drachmanns Hus on Hans Baghs Vej in the west of the town is a large property built in 1829.&#91;60&#93; Now a museum, it is dedicated to the writer and marine painter Holger Drachmann who lived in the house from 1902 until his death in a sanatorium in Hornbæk in January 1908. Drachmann had regularly visited Skagen from 1871.&#91;61&#93;&#91;60&#93; Drachmann's House, first opened to the public on 4 June 1911, offers a collection not only of his own oil paintings and sketchbooks,&#91;62&#93; but also of paintings from the colony's other artists including Krøyer, Tuxen and the Anchers.&#91;60&#93; An annex contains a photographic exhibition about Drachmann. Every year, the house hosts a "Drachmann evening"  in which enthusiasts gather together to hear readings, oral presentations and music related to the writer's life and works.&#91;60&#93;
In central Skagen there is a teddy bear museum, Skagen Bamsemuseum. The teddy bears on display belong to the private collection of the owner Jonna Thygesen.&#91;63&#93; It is the only teddy bear museum in Scandinavia. Opened in 1998, the collection contains about a thousand bears of all kinds, some of historic value. The museum also has a sculptured garden, an ice café and a teddy bear shop. Special events are arranged at Easter and Christmas.&#91;64&#93;
The Skagen Odde Nature Centre located close to the northern tip of the peninsula is a museum specially built to allow visitors to see, hear and understand more about the area's sand, water, wind and light. Each of the pavilions presents one of these elements in a special atmosphere. Designed by Jørn Utzon, it is the most northerly building on Skagen Odde.&#91;65&#93;
Skagen Town and Regional Museum (Skagen By- og Egnsmuseum), an open-air museum, was opened by the local population in 1927. In 1938 it was moved to the sand dunes of Vesterby.&#91;66&#93; The museum brings together examples of fishermen's cottages and the homes of less fortunate inhabitants of Skagen in the middle of the 19th century. There is an old life-saving station, a smithy, an old Dutch windmill, pictures of ships in distress and related nautical artefacts as well as a collection of items illustrating the town's history over various periods.&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93;
Skagen's first school was the Latinskole, a grammar school, which was in operation from 1549 until 1739. By the end of the 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen: one in Vesterby, another in Østerby and a third in Højen. As a result of evolving legislation, a new public primary school (Borgerskolen) designed by A. Haunstrup was completed in 1901. A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate the growing number of pupils. A secondary school (Realskolen) was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on Sct. Laurentii vej. The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended. An additional two-storey wing was completed in 1969.&#91;69&#93;
In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School was opened to train navigators for both fishing boats and merchant ships. It is now the only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat.&#91;70&#93; In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003.&#91;71&#93; The private school Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A primary goal is active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.&#91;72&#93;
Skagen's sports centre dates from 1974 when its large hall was completed. A smaller hall with bedrooms was built in 1999. The centre has facilities for badminton, basketball, handball, hockey and tennis in addition to its football fields. Overnight accommodation is also available.&#91;73&#93; Skagen Idræts Klub, the local football club founded in 1946, plays in Jyllandsserien, one of the lower divisions in  Denmark's football system.&#91;74&#93; Skagen also has a badminton club&#91;75&#93; and a tennis club,&#91;76&#93; The Hvide Klit Golf Club is located some 17 ;km (11 ;mi) south of the town on the road to Ålbæk. In season, it is popular with tourists.&#91;77&#93;
The Skagen Line connects Skagen with Frederikshavn Station in Frederikshavn to the south. Nordjyske Jernbaner operates a frequent train service between Skagen and Frederikshavn with onward connections by train to the rest of Denmark. Skagen Station, the most northerly railway station in mainland Denmark, is the principal station of the town. Skagen's first station, opened in 1890, was designed by Thomas Arboe. The current building, completed in 1919, is the work of the architect Ulrik Plesner.&#91;10&#93;&#91;78&#93; The western part of Skagen is also served by the Frederikshavnsvej railway halt.
In the summer, there are buses from Skagen to Blokhus via Hirtshals.
From Frederikshavn, there are ferries to Gothenburg and Oslo. From Hirtshals, there are ferries to Stavanger, Bergen, Larvik, Faroe Islands and Langesund
Aalborg Airport with flights to destinations across Europe is located some 100 ;km (62 ;mi) southwest of Skagen. It can be reached by rail and metro.&#91;79&#93;
Skagen lies along Danish national road 40, also known as Frederikshavnsvej, which connects the town to Frederikshavn, via Ålbæk to the southeast. The stretch of the road between Skagen and Ålbæk was asphalted in 1932.&#91;4&#93; Hirtshals on the western side of the peninsula can be reached by taking Road 597 from Ålbæk.&#91;18&#93; The Bøjlevejen road is the main skirt road around the town to the north, along which lies the Skagen Odde Nature Centre.&#91;18&#93; In the peak season during the summer months, Skagen can become congested with traffic.&#91;80&#93;  Free parking facilities are provided for short periods, and there is also a metered car park near the train station. As in other Danish cities, cycling is popular, and Skagen Cykeludlejning, to the west of the train station, and Pedersen on Kappelborgvej rent out bikes to tourists.&#91;80&#93;&#91;81&#93; There are a number of interesting marked cycle routes in and around Skagen. These include circuits for mountain bikes.&#91;82&#93;
Among those born in Skagen are:
All the painters, writers and other members of the artists' colony also have close associations with Skagen.
Skagen is twinned with:

The Skagen Painters (Danish: Skagensmalerne) were a group of Scandinavian artists who gathered in the village of Skagen, the northernmost part of Denmark, from the late 1870s until the turn of the century. Skagen was a summer destination whose scenic nature, local milieu and social community attracted northern artists to paint en plein air, emulating the French Impressionists—though members of the Skagen colony were also influenced by Realist movements such as the Barbizon school. They broke away from the rather rigid traditions of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts, espousing the latest trends that they had learned in Paris. Among the group were Anna and Michael Ancher, Peder Severin Krøyer, Holger Drachmann, Karl Madsen, Laurits Tuxen, Marie Krøyer, Carl Locher, Viggo Johansen and Thorvald Niss from Denmark, Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén from Sweden, and Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen from Norway. The group gathered together regularly at the Brøndums Inn.
Skagen, in the very north of Jutland, was the largest fishing community in Denmark, with more than half of its population so engaged. Among the locals, fishermen were by far the most common subject for the Skagen painters. Skagen's long beaches were exploited in the group's landscapes; P.S. Krøyer, one of the best-known of the Skagen painters, was inspired by the light of the evening "Blue hour", which made the water and sky seem to optically merge. This is captured in one of his most famous paintings, Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Although the painters had their own individual styles without any requirement to adhere to a common approach or manifest, one of their common interests was to paint scenes of their own social gatherings, playing cards, celebrating or simply eating together.
Michael Ancher drew attention to the attractions of the area when his Will He Round the Point? (1885) was purchased by King Christian IX. He married Anna Brøndum, the only member of the group from Skagen, who became a pioneering female artist at a time when women were not permitted to study at Denmark's Royal Academy. Today the Skagens Museum, founded in the dining room at Brøndum's Hotel in October 1908, hosts many of their works of art, some 1,800 pieces in total. Many of the paintings have been digitized under the Google Art Project and are accessible online. Related exhibitions continue to be held; in 2008, the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen presented "The Skagen Painters—In a New Light", and in 2013, the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. presented "A World Apart: Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony".
The first notable artist to paint in Skagen was Martinus Rørbye (1803–1848), one of the central figures of the Golden Age of Danish Painting. His first visit was in 1833 but he returned towards the end of his life in 1847 and 1848. He is remembered in particular for his Men of Skagen on a Summer Evening in Fair Weather painted in 1848.&#91;1&#93; Another marine painter, Vilhelm Melbye (1824–1882), visited Skagen in 1848, painting his View over Skagen.&#91;2&#93; According to Karl Madsen, the painter Peter Raadsig (1806–1882) also visited the town on several occasions between 1862 and 1870, painting the dunes and the fishermen.&#91;3&#93; Christian Blache (1838–1920), another marine painter, first visited Skagen in 1869 when he painted his Grey Lighthouse. It was as a result of his influence that the poet and dramatist Holger Drachmann first visited the town in 1871.&#91;3&#93;
In the 1860s and 1870s, despite evolving trends in Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused to change their approach, insisting their students should continue to paint in the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism.&#91;4&#93; Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn, invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, to paint the local fishermen.&#91;5&#93; He became a friend of the Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums Gastgiveri, a guest house. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began to paint open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.&#91;6&#93;
In 1876 and especially in 1877, several other artists spent the summer in Skagen, using the Brøndums' house for accommodation and their frequent gatherings. Michael Ancher made Skagen his new home. He became engaged to Anna Brøndum in 1878 and married her in 1880. Their home then became a focal point for the artists, especially after King Christian IX bought Ancher's painting Will He Round the Point?.&#91;7&#93; Anna Ancher first took a serious interest in painting after the artists began to stay in her family's inn, leaving their paintings to dry in their rooms when they left for the day. She studied them carefully and in 1875 attended Vilhelm Kyhn's art school in Copenhagen. She was later influenced by Christian Krohg who taught her the art of painting people in their everyday lives and making full use of colour.&#91;8&#93; Krohg first came to Skagen in the summer of 1878, encouraged by Georg Brandes whom he had met in Berlin. He brought many of the latest international art trends with him, influencing the other members of the group. His encounters with the local population also exerted a strong influence on his own work.&#91;9&#93;
In 1882, the Anchers travelled abroad. While they were in Vienna, they met P.S. Krøyer who informed them he would also be going to Skagen that year, despite the fact that Ancher was apparently not too keen to have him there. Krøyer, who had enjoyed close contacts with several Impressionist artists in Paris, immediately became the central member and unofficial leader of the artists' colony. In 1883, he created the "Evening Academy" where the artists gathered to paint and discuss each other's work, often enjoying champagne.&#91;10&#93; In 1884, the German painter Fritz Stoltenberg took photographs of the artists celebrating in the Anchers' garden, just after the couple had moved into their new home. One of these photos in particular inspired Krøyer to paint Hip, Hip, Hurrah!, which took him four years to complete.&#91;6&#93;&#91;11&#93;
In 1890, the railway's arrival in Skagen not only led to the expansion of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.&#91;12&#93;
The Skagen painters quickly began to form a close-knit community as relationships grew between the artists and the young women from the area. In 1880, Michael Ancher married Anna Brøndum from the guest house, Viggo Johansen married Martha Møller, Anna's cousin, and Karl Madsen married Helene Christensen, a schoolteacher. The house the Anchers moved into in 1884 became a focus for the artists' colony, especially as the couple lived there all the year round. When their daughter Helga (the little girl in Hip, Hip, Hurrah!) died in 1964, she left the house to a foundation which soon turned it into a museum.&#91;15&#93; The Johansens acquired a large family between 1881 and 1886: Ellen Henriette (daughter of Henriette, Martha's sister, who died during childbirth), Lars, Fritz, Gerda and Bodil. They can be seen dancing around the Christmas tree in Johansen's painting Merry Christmas.&#91;16&#93;
Another key figure in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after falling in love with her in Paris in 1888.&#91;17&#93; The daughter of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be the most beautiful woman in Copenhagen. However, as the years went by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.&#91;18&#93;
The principal Danish painters included Karl Madsen, Laurits Tuxen, Marie Krøyer, Carl Locher, Viggo Johansen, Thorvald Niss, and most notably, Anna and Michael Ancher and Peder Severin Krøyer. There were also painters from the rest of Scandinavia including Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén from Sweden and Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen from Norway. The gatherings in Skagen were not restricted to painters. The Danish writers Georg Brandes, Holger Drachmann and Henrik Pontoppidan and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén were also members of the group.&#91;6&#93;
A number of other artists also joined the Skagen Painters for shorter periods. From Denmark they included Vilhelm Kyhn, Einar Hein and Frederik Lange, from Norway Frits Thaulow, Charles Lundh and Wilhelm Peters, from Sweden Wilhelm von Gegerfelt and Anna Palm de Rosa, from Germany Fritz Stoltenberg and Julius Runge, and from England Adrian Stokes and his Austrian-born wife, Marianne Stokes. The Danish composer Carl Nielsen and his wife Anne Marie, a sculptor, also spent summers in Skagen and eventually bought a summerhouse there.&#91;18&#93;&#91;24&#93;
The only member of the group born in Skagen, Anna Ancher (1859–1935), was the daughter of Erik Brøndum, the owner of the grocery shop and guest house which later became Brøndums Hotel. Inspired by the artists who stayed there, she received her first lessons from Karl Madsen, Viggo Johansen and Michael Ancher. From 1875, she spent several winters in Copenhagen at Vilhelm Kyhn's school for women painters.&#91;25&#93; As a result of her portraits of family and friends as well as her skills as a colourist, she is considered to be one of Denmark's finest artists although her talents were not fully appreciated until after her death.&#91;26&#93; Her works depict scenes from the home, children and women and religious life in Skagen. She now stands out as a pioneer at a time when women were not expected to become artists and were not admitted to the Royal Danish Academy.&#91;25&#93; Unlike her husband, she adopted a style of Realism, inspired above all by Christian Krohg. Commenting on her Blind Woman (1882) in which the face is illuminated in an otherwise dark portrait, Madsen pointed out that she was the first Danish artist to depict a sunbeam.&#91;27&#93; Her most cherished works include Girl in the Kitchen (1886), Sunlight in the Blue Room (1891) and A Mission Meeting (1903).
Michael Ancher (1849–1927), originally from the island of Bornholm, was invited to Skagen in 1874 by his friend Karl Madsen with whom he was studying at the Academy. In 1880, he married Anna Brøndum and settled in Skagen. He achieved his artistic breakthrough in 1879 with the painting Will he Round the Point? which was bought by Christian IX. Several other works by Ancher depict Skagen's heroic fishermen and their dramatic experiences at sea, combining Realism and with classical composition.&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93;  Key works include The Lifeboat is Carried Through The Dunes (1883), The Crew Are Saved (1894) and The Drowned Man (1896). He also painted portraits and landscapes, especially of Skagen's Østerby district. Many of his paintings can be seen in Skagens Museum. Michael Ancher has become one of Denmark's most cherished painters.&#91;30&#93;
Born in Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909) came to Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there after marrying Marie Triepcke in 1889.&#91;31&#93; He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornbæk on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement in his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the group of painters, creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light in his beach scenes while painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.&#91;32&#93; Key works include Summer Evening on Skagen's Southern Beach (1893), In the Grocer's Store When There is No Fishing (1892), and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach (1906) which shows many members of the community including Krøyer's daughter Vibeke, mayor Otto Schwartz and his wife Alba Schwartz, Michael Ancher, Degn Brøndum, Anna Ancher, Holger Drachmann and his third wife Soffi, Hugo Alfvén and Marie Krøyer.&#91;33&#93;
Viggo Johansen (1851–1935), who had studied at the Royal Academy with Michael Ancher (also without graduating), first went to Skagen in 1875. An active member of the group, he married Anna Ancher's cousin Martha Møller in 1880. From 1885, he exhibited in Paris where he was inspired by Claude Monet. His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison.&#91;34&#93; Monet's use of colour is reflected in his painting Christian Bindslev is ill (1890).&#91;35&#93; The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings, depicting the red-bearded Christian looking out towards the light at the foot of his bed where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall.&#91;36&#93; Among the works he painted in Skagen are Kitchen Interior (1884) which depicts his wife Martha arranging flowers, and the much brighter Dividing the Catch (1885) showing four fishermen who have pulled their boat up onto the beach while one of their wives hopes there will be something for the evening meal.&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93; After falling out with P.S. Krøyer in 1891, Johansen's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years but finally returned in 1903.&#91;39&#93; In 1906, he became a professor at the Royal Academy where he was director from 1911 to 1914.&#91;37&#93;
Somewhat forgotten today, Carl Locher (1851–1915) was one of the earlier visitors to Skagen. Holgen Drachmann, who had taught him before he attended the Royal Academy, persuaded him to go there in 1872.&#91;40&#93; Especially interested in marine painting, Locher adopted a realist impressionistic approach, influenced by the time he spent with Léon Bonnat in Paris during the 1870s.&#91;41&#93; A stickler for perfection, especially in his drawings, his works cover the transition from sailing ships to steamships and from the original Skagen to the evolving tourist destination.&#91;42&#93; His paintings include Fishing Cutters in the Moonlit Night, 1888, The Lightship at Skagen Reef (1892)  and above all The Mail Coach (c. 1890) which depicts the horse-drawn carriage which until the railway reached Skagen in 1890 was the way travellers arrived there from Frederikshavn.&#91;43&#93; In 1910, Locher built a house overlooking the beach at Skagen Østerby where he painted until he died of heart trouble in 1913.&#91;40&#93;&#91;44&#93;
Born and raised in Copenhagen, Laurits Tuxen (1853–1927) studied at the Royal Danish Academy together with P.S. Krøyer where he was considered to be one of the best painters. In 1875, he began to study in Paris in Léon Bonnat's studio with whom he also worked in subsequent years. His Suzanna i Badet (1878), first painted in Paris, was warmly received in the Copenhagen spring exhibition in 1879.&#91;45&#93; He first visited Skagen in 1870 but after a few more visits in the 1870s, did not return until 1901. After his first wife died of tuberculosis, he married the Norwegian Frederikke Treschow and bought a house in Skagen. There he painted a number of pictures depicting family and friends as well as landscapes.&#91;46&#93; Among the works from Skagen are The North Sea in Stormy Weather (1909), the powerful The Drowned Boy is Brought Ashore (1913) inspired by paintings of drownings he saw in France&#91;47&#93; and Pouring the Morning Coffee (1906) depicting Tuxen's wife Frederikke and his daughters Yvonne and Nina in their Skagen home, Villa Dagminne. Through his use of colour, brushstrokes and backlighting through the window flowers, the artist creates a homely atmosphere.&#91;48&#93; Tuxen's most famous paintings are however his portraits of European royal personalities, including Christian IX of Denmark, Queen Victoria and Czar Nicholas II.&#91;49&#93;
The Norwegian Christian Krohg (1852–1925) first visited Skagen with Frits Thaulow in 1879.&#91;50&#93; One of the most important figures in Norwegian art, he first studied law but his interest in art was triggered by his friendship with fellow student Eilif Peterssen. He attended J.F. Eckersberg's painting school in Christiania (now Oslo) before moving to Karlsruhe and Berlin where he studied under Karl Gussow, specializing in figure painting in the new idiom of Realism. In Berlin, he also developed a friendship with Georg Brandes. In 1879 he returned to Christiania before travelling to Skagen where he achieved his artistic breakthrough, attracted by the simple lives of the local fishermen. Depicting a fisherman at sea, his Babord litt (1879) is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.&#91;51&#93; His association with Ancher, Krøyer and the other members of the colony had a marked effect on his style as can be seen in the works he painted on returning to Norway.&#91;51&#93; He went to Paris in 1881–82, where was influenced by Édouard Manet and the Impressionist movement.&#91;50&#93; His experience of French art can be seen in several of his later Skagen paintings, including Tired (1885) and Braiding Her Hair (1888) in which the mother and child unusually have their backs facing the observer.&#91;52&#93; His lighter palette with bold brushstrokes and contrasting tones of blue, red and green give the painting a deeper texture.&#91;51&#93;
By adopting the plein-air approach, the painters were able to create their works in the open, immediately capturing the special effects of light and colour on their subjects.&#91;60&#93; Fishermen were considered an especially interesting group in view of their dangerous work and their heroic behaviour. Lars Kruse, depicted by Michael Ancher, was famous for his success in rescuing a number of sailors who would otherwise have drowned. P.S. Krøyer's works were less dramatic, depicting fishermen pulling their nets in after a day at sea. While some of the paintings portrayed authentic occurrences, the artists often paid the fishermen to act as models, supplementing their modest incomes.&#91;61&#93; Krøyer's works also included scenes of walks on the beach, romantic evenings in the moonlight and portraits of his wife Marie.&#91;62&#93; As time went by, Krøyer increasingly painted "moods", works which depicted the special atmosphere of the "Blue Hour" which developed in the evening as the sky merged with the sea.&#91;63&#93; In addition to his landscapes and family portraits, Laurits Tuxen is remembered for painting the flowers in his garden.&#91;64&#93; Anna Ancher's paintings, on the other hand, focused on interiors of the home, including women and children, in a more abstract style.&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93;
Skagens Museum was founded in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel in October 1908.&#91;67&#93; Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, Degn Brøndum, proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother, and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen were elected to form the first board of governors. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation was used as a museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel's garden to Skagens Museum as a site for a new building. Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the new museum was officially opened.&#91;68&#93;
In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad, who also planned the later extension to the museum inaugurated in 1989. In 1997, the museum administration moved into the Technical School. In 2014, the museum underwent a substantial, two-year extension of its main building, as well as a merger with the two historic house museums Anchers Hus and Drachmanns Hus. Today the collection now total almost 9,000 works. A selection of these works are on display at Skagens Museum.&#91;69&#93; Many of the museum's paintings have been digitized under the Google Art Project and are accessible online.&#91;70&#93;
The Skagen artists were the subject of the 1987 film Hip Hip Hurra! by the Swedish director Kjell Grede, inspired by Krøyer's famous painting.&#91;71&#93;
In 2012, the film The Passion of Marie, directed by Bille August, dramatized Marie's increasingly difficult relationship with her husband P.S. Krøyer. The film is based on the book Balladen om Marie by Anastassia Arnold.&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93;
There have been a number of exhibitions of the Skagen Painters in recent years. In 2008, the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Copenhagen presented "The Skagen Painters — In a New Light", contrasting the paintings depicting the artists with those of the fishermen.&#91;74&#93; In 2011, the Hirschsprung Museum in Copenhagen succeeded in arranging the largest exhibition of Krøyer's work titled ;: "Krøyer—i internationalt lys" (Krøyer—in international light), with works from museums and private collections in France, Germany, the United States and Scandinavia.&#91;75&#93; The National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. presented "A World Apart: Anna Ancher and the Skagen Art Colony" in 2013. It was the largest exhibition of Anna Ancher's paintings ever held in the United States.&#91;76&#93; In 2014, Skagens Museum, which frequently presents new aspects of the work of the Skagen Painters, concentrated its efforts on "Laurits Tuxen—colour, countryside and crown", presenting many works held in private collections illustrating the artist's involvement in establishing Kunstnernes Studieskole (The Artists' School of Study) in Copenhagen as well as his work as a court painter.&#91;77&#93;
A major exhibition of paintings by the Skagen Painters titled Michael Ancher – P.S. Krøyer: Venner og Rivaler (Friends and Rivals) is to be held at Arken, Copenhagen from 27 September 2014 to 12 April 2015.&#91;78&#93;

Skagens Museum is an art museum in Skagen, Denmark, that exhibits an extensive collection of works by members of the colony of Skagen Painters who lived and worked in the area in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Important artists include Marie and P. S. Krøyer, Anna and Michael Ancher, Laurits Tuxen, Viggo Johansen, and Holger Drachmann. The museum also hosts special exhibitions. Its facilities include a café in the Garden House, an old building which for a while served as home residence and studio of Anna and Michael Ancher.
Skagens Museum was founded on 20 October 1908 in the dining room at Brøndums Hotel. Among the founders were artists Michael Ancher, P.S. Krøyer and Laurits Tuxen, who were elected to form the first board of governors together with Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, and Degn Brøndum, proprietor of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother. The idea was to collect works by the Skagen Painters and to raise funds for the construction of a building for their exhibition.&#91;2&#93; It was also decided that the Brøndums Hotel's dining room should, in due time, be transferred to the new museum once it had been built. It had served as an important venue for the members of the artist colony ever since its formation in the 1870s.
The first exhibitions were arranged in the local technical school. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation was used as a temporary venue for the museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old garden of his hotel for the construction of a purpose-built museum. The architect Ulrik Plesner was charged with its design. He was an active member of the artistic community in Skagen and had already designed a number of buildings in the area. The building was financed by a combination of private donors and foundations with Degn Brøndum, Laurits Tuxen and the Ny Carlsberg Foundation as the largest contributors. Construction started in 1926 and the new museum was officially opened on 22 September 1928.&#91;2&#93;
In 1982, the exhibition rooms were extended with an annex designed by the Royal Surveyor, architect Jacob Blegvad. Blegvad also planned the later extension to the museum that was inaugurated in 1989.
In 1997, the museum administration moved into the Technical School.&#91;3&#93;
Today Skagens Museum has more than 1,800 works of art at its disposal. All important members of the artist colony are represented in the collections with central works, including Maria and P. S. Krøyer, Anna and Michael Ancher, Laurits Tuxen, Viggo Johansen and Holger Drachmann.
The museum also hosts special exhibitions.
The dining room of Brøndums Hotel as it appears today was designed by Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. Instigated by P. S. Krøyer, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection in its decoration. Over the years it had become a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. The dining room also features the furniture which Maria Krøyer designed for it in 1898.&#91;4&#93;
Today the dining room is also used for wedding ceremonies.&#91;4&#93;
The museum garden features some of the museum's sculptures.&#91;5&#93;
The Garden House is one of the oldest buildings in Skagen and received its name when it was incorporated into what was then the hotel garden. In 1853 it was used as a cholera lazaretto.
In 1880, after their wedding, Michael and Anna Ancher took up residency in the building. They used the eastern end as a studio with natural light from a large new window still present in the gable. Their daughter Helga Ancher was born in the house in 1883. The following year the family moved to a new house on Markvej, now known as the Michael and Anna Ancher House, but Michael Ancher continued to use the Garden House as a studio. Later it was used as a summer residence for artists.
After the Brøndum family donated the garden house to Skagens Museum in 1919, they hosted various exhibitions and established memorial rooms dedicated to P. S. Krøer and Holger Drachman. From 1989 ti 1997, the house served as an administration building. Since 2009, it has been a café.&#91;6&#93;
Many of the museum's paintings have been digitized under the Google Art Project. As of August 2013, 105 are accessible online.&#91;7&#93; The museum's director, Lisette Vind Ebbesen, believes it is important for the museum's paintings to be available online as it allows people from around the world to access the works even if they are unable to visit the museum itself. She is nevertheless convinced that visitors to the museum continue to appreciate the originals which provide a special kind of experience. In addition, they can access additional information about the works on iPod guides as they move through the museum, frequently spending longer as they study individual works.&#91;8&#93;
Another technological development has involved the painting Hip, Hip, Hurra! which is not part of the museum's physical collection as it hangs in the Gothenburg Museum of Art. Thanks to funding from the European Regional Development Fund, it was possible to develop a three-dimensional digital version of the painting in the museum next to the site where it was originally painted.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93;
In 2014, the museum underwent substantial extensions to the west of the original building. Planned by architects Friis &amp; Moltke, the work included a new building with an additional 2,000 ;m2 (22,000 ;sq ;ft) of floor space on the ground floor, first floor and in the basement. It currently provides space for special exhibitions and for the museum's shop on the ground floor as well as administrative offices on the first floor. The museum was thus extended from the original 509 ;m2 (5,480 ;sq ;ft) to 917 ;m2 (9,870 ;sq ;ft), allowing up to 50% of the museum's collection of 2,000 works to be displayed to visitors while offering better facilities for exhibiting sculptures and drawings. The project was completed on February 12, 2016. Skagens Museum is Denmark's fifth most popular art museum with up to 160,000 visitors a year. Frederikshavn Municipality has provided DKK 5 ;million for the project, supplemented by donations from a number of foundations.&#91;11&#93;
The museum has published several books, mostly in Danish and English, about the Skagen Painters, Danish artists' colonies and exhibitions held at the museum.&#91;12&#93; They include:

Anna Sofia Palm de Rosa (25 December 1859 ;&#8211;&#32;2 May 1924) was a Swedish artist and landscape painter. In the 1890s she became one of Sweden's most popular painters with her watercolours of steamers and sailing ships and scenes of Stockholm. She also painted a memorable picture of a game of cards in Skagen's Brøndums Hotel while she spent a summer with the Skagen Painters. At the age of 36, Anna Palm left Sweden for good, spending the rest of her life in the south of Italy, where she married an infantry officer.&#91;1&#93;
Born on Christmas Day 1859 in Stockholm, Palm de Rosa was the daughter of the painter Gustaf Wilhelm Palm and Eva Sandberg, who was the daughter of the painter Johan Gustaf Sandberg. The family home at No. 19 Barnhuträdgårdgatan (today Olof Palmas Gata) was a popular meeting place for their artist friends including Nils Kreuger, Gustaf Cederström, Georg Pauli and Vicke Andrén (1856-1930). Anna Palm was educated privately by her father who taught at the Elementary Drawing School (Elementarteckningsskolan) which prepared students for the Royal Swedish Academy of Art.&#91;2&#93;
She did not attend the Royal Academy itself as it was still unusual for women to study there. In the 1880s, she became a student of the history painter Edvard Perséus and the landscape painter Per Daniel Holm (1835–1903). In 1885, with her parents' support, she travelled to Denmark where she spent some time in Skagen, painting Et l'hombre parti på Brøndums Hotel (A game of L'hombre in Brøndums Hotel).&#91;3&#93; She also went to Antwerp where she studied under the marine painter Romain Steppe (1859–1927) before spending some time in Paris.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93;
Palm de Rosa was one of 84 artists who signed a letter in 1885 calling for radical changes in the Swedish Academy's teaching which they considered to be outdated. She nevertheless exhibited at the Academy in 1885 and 1887 and from 1889 to 1891 taught watercolour painting there. She was also a member of the recently formed association: Svenska konstnärinnor (Swedish female artists) together with Eva Bonnier, Hanna Pauli and Mina Carlson-Bredberg. The watercolours of marine scenes with steamers and sailing ships she painted around this time contributed to her rising popularity. She began to produce numerous small vedute to satisfy her many customers while also painting scenes of the city of Stockholm.&#91;5&#93;
On New Year's Eve 1895, at the age of 36, she left Sweden never to return. After spending a year in Paris, she moved to Italy where she met her husband to be, Infantry Lieutenant Alfredo de Rosa. After their wedding in Paris in 1901, the couple moved first to Capri, then finally settled in the Madonna dell'Arco, district of Sant'Anastasia, near Naples in 1908.
In addition to scenes of Italian life, she continued to paint landscapes of Stockholm including scenes of Gustaf Adolfs torg with the opera building as well as views of the 1897 Art and Industrial Exposition in Stockholm. The only explanation for her interest in such recent developments is that she must have received photographs from Sweden as a basis for her paintings. She may well have used of photographs taken by the Stockholm photographer Frans Gustaf Klemming (1859–1922), who also was behind some of the oil painting of Robert Lundberg (1861–1903), but she probably drew on views taken by various photographers.&#91;5&#93;&#91;6&#93;
During the First World War when her husband was called up, Palm de Rosa became extremely productive in her painting, especially in Baiae on the Gulf of Naples where she spent a year. After the war, she grew increasingly frail until her death in May 1924.&#91;5&#93;
Her work is represented at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Gothenburg Art Museum and Uppsala University as well as at museums in Norrköping and Helsinki.&#91;7&#93;

The Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. (WMF, or simply Wikimedia) is an American non-profit and charitable organization headquartered in San Francisco, California.&#91;7&#93; It is mostly known for participating in the Wikimedia movement. It owns the internet domain names of many movement projects and hosts sites like Wikipedia. The foundation was founded in 2003 by Jimmy Wales as a way to fund Wikipedia and its sibling projects through non-profit means.&#91;8&#93;&#91;9&#93;
As of 2017&#91;update&#93;, the foundation employs over 300 people, with annual revenues in excess of US$109.9 million.&#91;10&#93; María Sefidari is chair of the board.&#91;3&#93; Katherine Maher has been the executive director since March 2016.
The Wikimedia Foundation has the stated goal of developing and maintaining open content, wiki-based projects and providing the full contents of those projects to the public free of charge.&#91;11&#93;  Another main objective of the Wikimedia Foundation is political advocacy.&#91;12&#93;
The Wikimedia Foundation was granted section 501(c)(3) status by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as a public charity in 2005.&#91;13&#93;  Its National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code is B60 (Adult, Continuing education).&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93; The foundation's by-laws declare a statement of purpose of collecting and developing educational content and to disseminate it effectively and globally.&#91;16&#93;
In 2001, Jimmy Wales, an Internet entrepreneur, and Larry Sanger, an online community organizer and philosophy professor, founded Wikipedia as an Internet encyclopedia to supplement Nupedia. The project was originally funded by Bomis, Jimmy Wales's for-profit business. As Wikipedia's popularity increased, revenues to fund the project stalled.&#91;8&#93; Since Wikipedia was depleting Bomis's resources, Wales and Sanger thought of a charity model to fund the project.&#91;8&#93; The Wikimedia Foundation was incorporated in Florida on June 20, 2003.&#91;9&#93;&#91;17&#93;  It applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office to trademark Wikipedia on September 14, 2004. The mark was granted registration status on January 10, 2006. Trademark protection was accorded by Japan on December 16, 2004, and, in the European Union, on January 20, 2005. There were plans to license the use of the Wikipedia trademark for some products, such as books or DVDs.&#91;18&#93;
The name "Wikimedia", a compound of wiki and media, was coined by American author Sheldon Rampton in a post to the English mailing list in March 2003,&#91;19&#93; three months after Wiktionary became the second wiki-based project hosted on Wales' platform.
In April 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service approved the foundation as an educational foundation in the category "Adult, Continuing education", meaning all contributions to the foundation are tax-deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
On December 11, 2006, the foundation's board noted that the corporation could not become the membership organization initially planned but never implemented due to an inability to meet the registration requirements of Florida statutory law. Accordingly, the by-laws were amended to remove all reference to membership rights and activities. The decision to change the bylaws was passed by the board unanimously.&#91;20&#93;&#91;9&#93;
On September 25, 2007, the foundation's board gave notice that the operations would be moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. Major considerations cited for choosing San Francisco were proximity to like-minded organizations and potential partners, a better talent pool, as well as cheaper and more convenient international travel than is available from St. Petersburg, Florida.&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93; The move from Florida was completed by 31 January 2008 with the headquarters on Stillman Street in San Francisco.&#91;24&#93;
In 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation's headquarters moved to New Montgomery Street.
Lila Tretikov was appointed executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in May 2014.&#91;25&#93;&#91;26&#93; She resigned in March 2016. Former chief communications officer Katherine Maher was appointed the interim executive director, a position made permanent in June 2016.
In October 2017, the headquarters moved to San Francisco's One Montgomery Tower.&#91;27&#93; They appointed Janeen Uzzell as Chief Operating Officer in early 2019.&#91;28&#93;

The foundation operates eleven wikis that follow the free content model with their main goal being the dissemination of knowledge. These include, by launch date:
Several additional projects exist to provide infrastructure or coordination of the free knowledge projects. For instance, Outreach gives guidelines for best practices on encouraging the use of Wikimedia sites. These include:
Wikimedia movement affiliates are independent, but formally recognized, groups of people intended to work together to support and contribute to the Wikimedia movement. The Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees has approved three active models for movement affiliates: chapters, thematic organizations, and user groups. Movement affiliates are intended to organize and engage in activities to support and contribute to the Wikimedia movement, such as regional conferences, outreach, edit-a-thons, hackathons, public relations, public policy advocacy, GLAM engagement, and Wikimania.&#91;38&#93;&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;
Recognition of a chapter and thematic organization is approved by the foundation's board. Recommendations on recognition of chapters and thematic organizations are made to the foundation's board by an Affiliations Committee, composed of Wikimedia community volunteers. The Affiliations Committee approves the recognition of individual user groups. While movement affiliates are formally recognized by the Wikimedia Foundation, they are independent of the Wikimedia Foundation, with no legal control of nor responsibility for the Wikimedia projects.&#91;39&#93;&#91;40&#93;&#91;41&#93;
The foundation began recognizing chapters in 2004.&#91;42&#93; In 2010, development on additional models began. In 2012, the foundation approved, finalized, and adopted the thematic organization and user group recognition models. An additional model, movement partners, was also approved but as of 27 ;October ;2015&#91;update&#93; has not yet been finalized or adopted.&#91;38&#93;&#91;40&#93;&#91;43&#93;
Each year, an international conference called Wikimania brings the people together who are involved in the Wikimedia organizations and projects. The first Wikimania was held in Frankfurt, Germany, in 2005. Nowadays, Wikimania is organized by a committee supported usually by the national chapter, in collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimania has been held in cities such as Buenos Aires,&#91;44&#93; Cambridge,&#91;45&#93; Haifa,&#91;46&#93; Hong Kong,&#91;47&#93; and London.&#91;48&#93; In 2015, Wikimania took place in Mexico City,&#91;49&#93; in 2016 in Esino Lario, Italy,&#91;50&#93; 2017 in Montreal, 2018 in Cape Town, and 2019 in Stockholm.
In response to the growing size and popularity of Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a Strategic Plan to improve and sustain the Wikimedia movement. The plan was announced in July 2009, followed by a process of interviews and surveys with people from across the Wikimedia movement, including board of trustees, members of staff and volunteer editors.&#91;51&#93; The ongoing plan was intended to be the basis of a five-year plan to further outreach, improve content quality and quality control, and optimising operational areas such as finance and infrastructure.&#91;52&#93;
In December 2008, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a restricted donation grant of US$890,000 from the Stanton Foundation, to improve Wikipedia's accessibility.&#91;53&#93; Later named the Wikipedia Usability Initiative, the grant was used by the Wikimedia Foundation to appoint project-specific staff to the technology department.&#91;54&#93;
A series of surveys were conducted throughout 2009. This began with a qualitative environment survey on MediaWiki extensions, followed by a Qualitative Statistical Survey focusing on the volume of edits, the number of new users, and related statistics. In March 2009, a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were collated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's usability.&#91;55&#93; The Usability and Experience Study was followed up by the Usability, Experience and Progress Study in September 2009. This study recruited different new and non-editors for in-person trials on a new Wikipedia skin.&#91;56&#93;
The initiative ultimately culminated in a new Wikipedia skin named Vector, constructed based on the results of the usability studies. This was introduced by default in stages, beginning in May 2010.&#91;57&#93;
In May 2010, the Wikimedia Foundation announced the Public Policy Initiative, following a US$1.2 million donation by the Stanton Foundation. The initiative was set up to improve articles relating to public policy issues.&#91;58&#93; As part of the initiative, Wikipedia collaborated with ten universities to help students and professors create and maintain articles relating to public policy.&#91;59&#93; Volunteer editors of Wikipedia, known as "ambassadors", provided assistance to students and professors. This was either done on campus sites or online.&#91;60&#93;
In April 2017, the foundation was one of the founding partners in the Initiative for Open Citations.&#91;61&#93;
The foundation employs technology including hardware and software to run its projects.
Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture.&#91;62&#93;
In January 2005, the project ran on 39 dedicated servers&#91;citation needed&#93; in Florida.&#91;63&#93; This configuration included a single master database server running MySQL, multiple database servers, 21 web servers running the Apache HTTP Server, and seven Squid cache servers.&#91;citation needed&#93;
By December 2009, Wikimedia ran on co-located servers, with 300 servers in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.&#91;64&#93; Since 2008, it also switched from multiple different Linux operating system vendors to Ubuntu Linux.&#91;65&#93;&#91;66&#93;
By January 2013, Wikimedia transitioned to newer infrastructure in an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia; citing reasons of "more reliable connectivity" and "fewer hurricanes".&#91;67&#93;&#91;68&#93; In years prior, the hurricane seasons had been cause of distress.&#91;63&#93;
In October 2013, Wikimedia Foundation started looking for a second facility that would be used side by side with the main facility in Ashburn, citing reasons of redundancy (e.g. emergency fallback) and to prepare for simultaneous multi-datacentre service.&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93; This follows the year in which a fiber cut caused the Wikimedia projects to be unavailable for one hour in August 2012.&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93;
Apart from the second facility for redundancy coming online in 2014,&#91;73&#93;&#91;74&#93; the number of servers needed to run the infrastructure in a single facility has been mostly stable since 2009. As of November 2015, the main facility in Ashburn hosts 520 servers in total, which includes servers for newer services besides Wikimedia project wikis, such as Cloud Services (Toolforge), and various services for metrics, monitoring, and other system administration.&#91;75&#93;
In 2017, Wikimedia Foundation deployed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.&#91;76&#93;
The operation of Wikimedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open-source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MariaDB database since 2013,&#91;77&#93; previously was using MySQL database.&#91;78&#93; The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.
Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software. In April 2005, an Apache Lucene extension&#91;79&#93;&#91;80&#93; was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Currently Lucene Search 2.1,&#91;81&#93; which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3,&#91;82&#93; is used. The Wikimedia Foundation also uses CiviCRM&#91;83&#93; and WordPress.&#91;84&#93;
The foundation published official Wikipedia mobile apps for Android and iOS devices and in March 2015, the apps were updated to include mobile user-friendly features.&#91;85&#93;
The Wikimedia Foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.&#91;86&#93; It is exempt from federal income tax&#91;86&#93;&#91;87&#93; and from state income tax.&#91;86&#93;&#91;88&#93; It is not a private foundation, and contributions to it qualify as tax-deductible charitable contributions.&#91;86&#93;
The continued technical and economic growth of each of the Wikimedia projects is dependent mostly on donations, but the Wikimedia Foundation also increases its revenue by alternative means of funding such as grants, sponsorship, services and brand merchandising. The Wikimedia OAI-PMH update feed service, targeted primarily at search engines and similar bulk analysis and republishing, has been a source of revenue for several years,&#91;86&#93; but is no longer open to new customers.&#91;89&#93; DBpedia was given access to this feed free of charge.&#91;90&#93;
In July 2014, the foundation announced it would be accepting Bitcoin donations via digital currency exchange Coinbase, which waives its processing fees for non-profit organizations.&#91;91&#93;
Since the end of fiscal year ended 2004, the foundation's net assets have grown from US$57,000&#91;92&#93; to US$53.5 million at the end of fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.&#91;93&#93; Under the leadership of Sue Gardner, who joined the Wikimedia Foundation in 2007, the foundation's staff levels, number of donors and revenue have seen very significant growth.&#91;94&#93;
In 2007, 2008, and 2009, Charity Navigator gave Wikimedia an overall rating of three out of four possible stars,&#91;95&#93; increasing to four stars in 2010.&#91;96&#93; As of November 2019&#91;update&#93;, the rating was four stars (overall score 98.14 out of 100), based on data from FY2018.&#91;97&#93;
The Wikimedia Foundation expenses mainly concern salaries, wages and other professional operating and services.&#91;98&#93;
In 2008, the foundation received a US$40,000 grant by the Open Society Institute to create a printable version of Wikipedia.&#91;99&#93; It also received a US$262,000 grant by the Stanton Foundation to purchase hardware,&#91;100&#93; a US$500,000 unrestricted grant by Vinod and Neeru Khosla,&#91;101&#93; who later that year joined the foundation Advisory Board,&#91;102&#93; US$177,376 from the historians Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin foundation (Arcadia Fund), among others.&#91;100&#93; In March 2008, the foundation announced a large donation, at the time its largest donation yet: a three-year, US$3 million grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.&#91;103&#93;
In 2009, the foundation received four grants ;– the first grant was a US$890,000 Stanton Foundation grant which was aimed to help study and simplify user interface for first-time authors of Wikipedia.&#91;104&#93; The second was a US$300,000 Ford Foundation grant, given in July 2009, for Wikimedia Commons that aimed to improve the interfaces and workflows for multimedia uploading on Wikimedia websites.&#91;105&#93; In August 2009, the foundation received a US$500,000 grant from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.&#91;106&#93; Lastly, in August 2009, the Omidyar Network committed up to US$2 million over two years to Wikimedia.&#91;107&#93;
In 2010, Google donated US$2 million to the foundation.&#91;108&#93; The Stanton Foundation granted $1.2 ;million to fund the Public Policy Initiative, a pilot program for what would later become the Wikipedia Education Program (and the spinoff Wiki Education Foundation).&#91;109&#93;&#91;110&#93;&#91;111&#93; Also in 2010, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation pledged a US$800,000 grant and all was funded during 2011.&#91;citation needed&#93;
In March 2011, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation authorized another US$3 million grant to continue to develop and maintain the foundation's mission. The grant was to be funded over three years with the first US$1 million funded in July 2011 and the remaining US$2 million was scheduled to be funded in August 2012 and 2013. As a major donor, Doron Weber from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation gained Board Visitor status at the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.&#91;112&#93; In August 2011, the Stanton Foundation pledged to fund a US$3.6 million grant of which US$1.8 million was funded and the remainder was due to be funded in September 2012. As of 2011, this was the largest grant received by the Wikimedia Foundation to-date.&#91;113&#93; In November 2011, the foundation received a US$500,000 donation from the Brin Wojcicki Foundation.&#91;114&#93;&#91;115&#93;
In 2012, the foundation was awarded a grant of US$1.25 million from the historians Lisbet Rausing&#91;114&#93; and Peter Baldwin through Charities Aid Foundation, scheduled to be funded in five equal installments. The first installment of US$250,000 was received in April 2012 and the remaining were to be funded in December 2012 through 2015. In 2014, the foundation received the largest single gift in its history, a $5 ;million unrestricted donation from an anonymous donor supporting $1 ;million worth of expenses annually for the next five years.&#91;116&#93; In March 2012, The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, a foundation established by Intel co-founder and his wife, awarded a US$449,636 grant to develop Wikidata.&#91;117&#93;
Between 2014 and 2015, the foundation received US$500,000 from Monarch Fund, US$100,000 from Arcadia Fund and an undisclosed amount by Stavros Niarchos Foundation to support the Wikipedia Zero initiative.&#91;118&#93;&#91;119&#93;&#91;120&#93;
In 2015, a grant agreement was reached with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to build a search engine called the "Knowledge Engine".&#91;121&#93;&#91;122&#93;
In 2017, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation awarded another US$3 million grant for a three-year period.&#91;112&#93;
The following have donated a total of US$500,000 or more, each (2008–2019):
In January 2016, the foundation announced the creation of an endowment to ensure the continuity of the project in the future. The Wikimedia Endowment was established as a collective action fund at the Tides Foundation and its goal is to raise US$100 million in the next 10 years.&#91;123&#93; Craig Newmark was one of the initial donors, giving US$1 million to the endowment.&#91;124&#93;
The Foundation provided irrevocable grants of $5 ;million on June 29, 2016, and $5 ;million on June 27, 2017, to the Tides Foundation for the purpose of the Wikimedia Endowment.&#91;125&#93; Another $5 ;million was given in the fiscal year 2017–2018. The amounts were recorded as part of the expense for awards and grants of the foundation.&#91;4&#93;
In 2018, Amazon.com and Facebook gave US$1 million each and George Soros donated $2 ;million to the endowment.&#91;126&#93;&#91;127&#93;&#91;128&#93; In January 2019, Google donated $2 ;million to the endowment.&#91;129&#93; In 2019, Peter Baldwin and his wife, Lisbet Rausing, donated $3.5 ;million, bringing their total Endowment giving to $8.5 ;million; an initial $5 ;million was given in 2017.&#91;5&#93; In 2019, Craig Newmark Philanthropies donated an additional $2.5 ;million to the Endowment.&#91;130&#93; In October 2019, Amazon  donated $1 ;million to the Endowment.&#91;131&#93;
The foundation's board of trustees has ultimate authority of all the businesses and affairs of the foundation. It is composed of ten members:
Three permanent entities support the board on its mission and responsibilities: an executive director, who leads and oversees the operational arm of the foundation; an advisory board composed of individuals selected by the board itself that advise the board on different matters; and standing committees to which the board delegates certain matters while retaining ultimate authority. The board has also at times created other orthodox entities&#91;clarification needed&#93; to support itself, such as executive secretaries and ad-hoc committees established for specific tasks.
The current board comprises María Sefidari as chairman and Nataliia Tymkiv as vice-chairman, together with Tanya Capuano, Shani Evenstein Sigalov, Dariusz Jemielniak as members at-large, and Jimmy Wales in the "founder's seat" (installed as "Community Founder Trustee Position" to the WMF bylaws in August 2008).&#91;143&#93;&#91;144&#93; James Heilman was appointed as a community selected trustee in August 2017.&#91;145&#93; Raju Narisetti, CEO of Gizmodo Media Group, was appointed trustee in October 2017,&#91;146&#93; and Bahraini human rights activist and blogger Esra'a Al Shafei idem in November 2017.&#91;147&#93;
In a high-profile decision of 2015, James Heilman was removed from the board,&#91;148&#93;&#91;149&#93; with little explanation.&#91;148&#93; (He returned in the Board in August 2017).&#91;150&#93;&#91;clarification needed&#93; In January 2016, Arnnon Geshuri briefly joined the board before stepping down from the board following a controversy about an agreement he executed when at Google, violating United States antitrust law. The participating companies paid US$415 ;million in a class action suit on behalf of affected employees.&#91;151&#93;&#91;152&#93;
The advisory board, according to the Wikimedia Foundation, is an international network of experts who have agreed to give the foundation meaningful help on a regular basis in many different areas, including law, organizational development, technology, policy, and outreach.&#91;153&#93;
Appointed members for the period from June 16, 2017 to June 30, 2018 were:&#91;154&#93;

In 2004, the foundation appointed Tim Starling as developer liaison to help improve the MediaWiki software, Daniel Mayer as chief financial officer (finance, budgeting, and coordination of fund drives), and Erik Möller as content partnership coordinator. In May 2005, the foundation announced seven more official appointments.&#91;155&#93;
In January 2006, the foundation created several committees, including the Communication Committee, in an attempt to further organize activities essentially handled by volunteers at that time.&#91;156&#93; Starling resigned that month to spend more time on his PhD program.
The foundation's functions were, for the first few years, executed almost entirely by volunteers. In 2005, it had only two employees, Danny Wool, a coordinator, and Brion Vibber, a software manager.
As of October ;4,&#32;2006&#91;update&#93;, the foundation had five paid employees:&#91;157&#93; two programmers, an administrative assistant, a coordinator handling fundraising and grants, and an interim executive director,&#91;158&#93; Brad Patrick, previously the foundation's general counsel. Patrick ceased his activity as interim director in January 2007, and then resigned from his position as legal counsel, effective April 1, 2007. He was replaced by Mike Godwin, who served as general counsel and legal coordinator from July 2007&#91;159&#93; until 2010.
In January 2007, Carolyn Doran was named chief operating officer and Sandy Ordonez joined as head of communications.&#91;160&#93; Doran began working as a part-time bookkeeper in 2006 after being sent by a temporary agency. Doran, found to have had a long criminal record,&#91;161&#93; left the foundation in July 2007, and Sue Gardner was hired as consultant and special advisor (later CEO). Doran's departure from the organization was cited by Florence Devouard as one of the reasons the foundation took about seven months to release its fiscal 2007 financial audit.&#91;162&#93;
Danny Wool, officially the grant coordinator but also largely involved in fundraising and business development, resigned in March 2007. He accused Wales of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes, and said that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied.&#91;163&#93; In February 2007, the foundation added a new position, chapters coordinator, and hired Delphine Ménard,&#91;164&#93; who had been occupying the position as a volunteer since August 2005. Cary Bass was hired in March 2007 in the position of volunteer coordinator. Oleta McHenry was brought in as accountant in May 2007, through a temporary placement agency and made the official full-time accountant in August 2007. In January 2008, the foundation appointed Veronique Kessler as the new chief financial and operating officer, Kul Wadhwa as head of business development, and Jay Walsh as head of communications.
As of December ;19,&#32;2019,&#91;update&#93; the foundation had more than 350 employees and contractors.&#91;6&#93;
Many disputes have resulted in litigation&#91;165&#93;&#91;166&#93;&#91;167&#93;&#91;168&#93; while others have not.&#91;169&#93; Attorney Matt Zimmerman stated, "Without strong liability protection, it would be difficult for Wikipedia to continue to provide a platform for user-created encyclopedia content."&#91;170&#93;
In December 2011, the foundation hired Washington, DC, lobbyist Dow Lohnes Government Strategies LLC to lobby the United States Congress with regard to "Civil Rights/Civil Liberties" and "Copyright/Patent/Trademark."&#91;171&#93; At the time of the hire the Foundation was concerned specifically about a bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.&#91;172&#93;
In October 2013, a German Court ruled that the Wikimedia Foundation can be held liable for content added to Wikipedia – however, this applies only when there has been a specific complaint; otherwise, the Wikimedia Foundation does not check any of the content published on Wikipedia and has no duty to do so.&#91;173&#93;
In June 2014, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed by Bildkonst Upphovsrätt i Sverige against Wikimedia Sweden.&#91;174&#93;
On June 20, 2014, a defamation lawsuit (Law Division civil case No. L-1400-14) involving Wikipedia editors was filed with the Mercer County Superior Court in New Jersey seeking, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages.&#91;175&#93;&#91;176&#93;
In a March 10, 2015, op-ed for The New York Times, Wales and Tretikov announced the foundation was filing a lawsuit against the National Security Agency and five other government agencies and officials, including the DOJ, calling into question its practice of mass surveillance, which they argued infringed the constitutional rights of the foundation's readers, editors and staff. They were joined in the suit by eight additional plaintiffs, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.&#91;177&#93;&#91;178&#93;&#91;179&#93; On October 23, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland dismissed the suit Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA on grounds of standing. U.S. District Judge T. S. Ellis III ruled that the plaintiffs could not plausibly prove they were subject to upstream surveillance, and that their argument is "riddled with assumptions", "speculations" and "mathematical gymnastics".&#91;180&#93;&#91;181&#93; The plaintiffs filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on February 17, 2016.&#91;182&#93;
In February 2016, Lila Tretikov announced her resignation as executive director, as a result of the WMF's controversial Knowledge Engine project and disagreements with the staff.&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93;
During the 2015 fundraising campaign, some members of the community voiced their concerns about the fundraising banners. They argued that they were obtrusive for users and that they could be deceiving potential donors by giving the perception that Wikipedia had immediate financial issues, which was not the case. The Wikimedia Foundation vowed to improve wording on further fundraising campaigns to avoid these issues.&#91;185&#93;
In June 2015, James Heilman was elected by the community to the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees.&#91;186&#93; In December 2015, the Board removed Heilman from his position as a Trustee,&#91;187&#93;&#91;188&#93; a decision that generated substantial controversy amongst members of the Wikipedia community.&#91;148&#93; A statement released by the board declared the lack of confidence of his fellow trustees in him as the reasons for his ouster. Heilman later stated that he "was given the option of resigning [by the Board] over the last few weeks. As a community elected member I see my mandate as coming from the community which elected me and thus declined to do so. I saw such a move as letting down those who elected me."&#91;189&#93; He subsequently pointed out that while on the Board, he had pushed for greater transparency regarding the Wikimedia Foundation's controversial Knowledge Engine project and its financing,&#91;190&#93; and indicated that his attempts to make public the Knight Foundation grant for the engine had been a factor in his dismissal.&#91;191&#93;
The volunteer community re-elected him to the Wikimedia Foundation board in 2017.&#91;150&#93;
Knowledge Engine was a search engine project initiated in 2015 by the WMF to locate and display verifiable and trustworthy information on the Internet.&#91;192&#93; The goal of the KE was to be less reliant on traditional search engines and it was funded with a US$250,000 grant from the Knight Foundation.&#91;193&#93; The project was perceived as a scandal, mainly because it was conceived in secrecy, which was perceived as a conflict with the Wikimedia community's transparency. In fact, most of the information available to the community was received through leaked documents published by The Signpost in 2016.&#91;194&#93;&#91;192&#93;
Following this controversy, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director Lila Tretikov resigned.&#91;195&#93;
Wales was confronted with allegations that the WMF had "a miserable cost/benefit ratio and for years now has spent millions on software development without producing anything that actually works".&#91;150&#93; Wales acknowledged in 2014 that he had "been frustrated as well about the endless controversies about the rollout of inadequate software not developed with sufficient community consultation and without proper incremental rollout to catch show-stopping bugs".&#91;150&#93;
In February 2017, an op-ed published by The Signpost, English Wikipedia online newspaper, titled Wikipedia has Cancer&#91;196&#93; produced a heated debate both in the Wikipedian community and the wider public. The author criticized the Wikimedia Foundation for its ever-increasing annual spending which, he argued, could put the project at financial risk should an unexpected event happen. The author proposed to put a cap on spending, build up its existing endowment, and restructure the endowment so that the WMF cannot dip into the principal when times get bad.  Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director, Katherine Maher responded by pointing out that such an endowment was already created in 2016, confusing creating an endowment with building up an existing endowment.&#91;197&#93;

English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca.&#91;4&#93;&#91;5&#93; It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula on the Baltic Sea. English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as Latin and French.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93;
English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic (Ingvaeonic) dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are collectively called Old English. Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England; this was a period in which English was influenced by Old French, in particular though its Old Norman dialect.&#91;9&#93;&#91;10&#93; Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift.&#91;11&#93;
Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation and law.&#91;12&#93;
English is the largest language by number of speakers,&#91;13&#93; and the third most-spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish.&#91;14&#93; It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. It is estimated that there are over 2 ;billion speakers of English.&#91;15&#93; English is the majority native language in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa and South Asia.&#91;16&#93; It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union and many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. English speakers are called "Anglophones".
Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern, with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed subject–verb–object word order and a complex syntax.&#91;17&#93; Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. The variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions—in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, idioms, grammar, and spelling—can often be understood by speakers of different dialects, but in extreme cases can lead to confusion or even mutual unintelligibility between English speakers.
English is an Indo-European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.&#91;18&#93; Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the Frisian North Sea coast, whose languages gradually evolved into the Anglic languages in the British Isles, and into the Frisian languages and Low German/Low Saxon on the continent. The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the Anglo-Frisian languages, are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages, though this grouping remains debated.&#91;7&#93; Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English.&#91;19&#93; Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots&#91;20&#93; and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy (Yola) dialects of Ireland.&#91;21&#93;
Like Icelandic and Faroese, the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences. It has since evolved considerably. English is not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.&#91;22&#93;
Unlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades—but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole—a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93;
English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and Swedish.&#91;25&#93; These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, the use of modal verbs, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's and Verner's laws. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see Phonological history of Old English § ;Palatalization).&#91;26&#93;
The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066 CE). Old English developed from a set of North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. From the 5th century CE, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the 7th century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain (43–409 CE): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.&#91;27&#93;&#91;28&#93;&#91;29&#93; England and English (originally Ænglaland and Ænglisc) are named after the Angles.&#91;30&#93;
Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects (Mercian and Northumbrian) and the Saxon dialects, Kentish and West Saxon.&#91;31&#93; Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety.&#91;32&#93; The epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, Cædmon's Hymn, is written in Northumbrian.&#91;33&#93; Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a runic script.&#91;34&#93; By the 6th century, a Latin alphabet was adopted, written with half-uncial letterforms. It included the runic letters wynn &#x27e8;ƿ&#x27e9; and thorn &#x27e8;þ&#x27e9;, and the modified Latin letters eth &#x27e8;ð&#x27e9;, and ash &#x27e8;æ&#x27e9;.&#91;34&#93;&#91;35&#93;
Old English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and has a few verb inflections (speak, speaks, speaking, spoke, spoken), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.&#91;36&#93;&#91;37&#93;&#91;38&#93;
The translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000 CE shows examples of case endings (nominative plural, accusative plural, genitive singular) and a verb ending (present plural):
John of Trevisa, ca. 1385&#91;40&#93;
From the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through language contact into Middle English. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200–1450.
First, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in direct contact with Norse speakers. An element of Norse influence that persists in all English varieties today is the group of pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).&#91;41&#93;
With the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with Old French, in particular with the Old Norman dialect. The Norman language in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman.&#91;9&#93; Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.&#91;8&#93; Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,&#91;42&#93; and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.&#91;43&#93; In the Wycliffe Bible of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written:
Here the plural suffix -n on the verb have is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and French features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.&#91;45&#93;
The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.
The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.&#91;46&#93;&#91;47&#93;
English began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.&#91;48&#93; Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn ɡn sw/ in knight, gnat, and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.&#91;49&#93;
In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:
This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of of instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (ayre) and word replacements (bird originally meaning "nestling" had replaced OE fugol).&#91;50&#93;
By the late 18th century, the British Empire had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.&#91;51&#93;&#91;12&#93; England continued to form new colonies, and these later developed their own norms for speech and writing. English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.&#91;52&#93;&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93; In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC&#91;55&#93; and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93; In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.&#91;58&#93;
As Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.&#91;59&#93;
In modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as he and him, she and her, who and whom), and SVO word-order is mostly fixed.&#91;59&#93; Some changes, such as the use of do-support have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word "do" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.&#91;60&#93; Now, do-support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. more polite instead of politer). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power.&#91;61&#93;&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93;

As of 2016&#91;update&#93;, 400 ;million people spoke English as their first language, and 1.1 ;billion spoke it as a secondary language.&#91;64&#93; English is the largest language by number of speakers. English is spoken by communities on every continent and on islands in all the major oceans.&#91;65&#93;
The countries where English is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how English is used in each country. The "inner circle"&#91;66&#93; countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.
Braj Kachru distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a three circles model.&#91;66&#93; In his model,
Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.&#91;67&#93;
Countries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States (at least 231 ;million),&#91;68&#93; the United Kingdom (60 ;million),&#91;69&#93;&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93; Canada (19 ;million),&#91;72&#93; Australia (at least 17 ;million),&#91;73&#93; South Africa (4.8 ;million),&#91;74&#93; Ireland (4.2 ;million), and New Zealand (3.7 ;million).&#91;75&#93; In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.&#91;76&#93; The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.&#91;67&#93;
Estimates of the numbers of second language and foreign-language English speakers vary greatly from 470 ;million to more than 1 ;billion, depending on how proficiency is defined.&#91;16&#93; Linguist David Crystal estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.&#91;77&#93; In Kachru's three-circles model, the "outer circle" countries are countries such as the Philippines,&#91;78&#93; Jamaica,&#91;79&#93; India, Pakistan, Singapore,&#91;80&#93; Malaysia and Nigeria&#91;81&#93;&#91;82&#93; with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government.&#91;83&#93;
Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.&#91;76&#93; Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,&#91;76&#93; and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.&#91;76&#93;
In the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the "expanding circle".&#91;84&#93; The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.&#91;83&#93; For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,&#91;85&#93; and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the "outer circle" and "expanding circle". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.&#91;86&#93;
Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.&#91;87&#93; Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.&#91;88&#93; Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.&#91;89&#93;
Pie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in "inner circle" English-speaking countries. Native speakers are now substantially outnumbered worldwide by second-language speakers of English (not counted in this chart).
English is a pluricentric language, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.&#91;90&#93;&#91;91&#93;&#91;92&#93;&#91;93&#93; But English is not a divided language,&#91;94&#93; despite a long-standing joke originally attributed to George Bernard Shaw that the United Kingdom and the United States are "two countries separated by a common language".&#91;95&#93; Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents,&#91;96&#93; but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.&#91;97&#93;
American listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.&#91;98&#93; Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.&#91;99&#93;
The settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.&#91;100&#93; The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,&#91;101&#93;&#91;68&#93; although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US.&#91;102&#93;&#91;103&#93;
English has ceased to be an "English language" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English.&#91;104&#93;&#91;105&#93; Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.&#91;106&#93; Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an "Afro-Saxon" language community that unites Africans from different countries.&#91;107&#93;
As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.&#91;53&#93;&#91;54&#93;&#91;108&#93; For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.&#91;109&#93; English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.&#91;110&#93; However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.&#91;111&#93;&#91;112&#93; David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,&#91;113&#93; but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.&#91;114&#93;
Modern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,&#91;56&#93;&#91;115&#93; is also regarded as the first world language.&#91;116&#93;&#91;117&#93; English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.&#91;117&#93; English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages&#91;118&#93; Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring&#91;119&#93; and aviation.&#91;120&#93; English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.&#91;121&#93; It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.&#91;122&#93; By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II, English had become pre-eminent&#91;123&#93; and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.&#91;124&#93; It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.&#91;125&#93; Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.
Many regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),&#91;57&#93; and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.&#91;126&#93;
Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.&#91;56&#93;&#91;57&#93; In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll (conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU), 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.&#91;127&#93;
A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine&#91;128&#93; and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.&#91;129&#93;
International communities such as international business people may use English as an auxiliary language, with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. The trademarked Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words, designed to represent the highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar.&#91;130&#93; Other examples include Simple English.
The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about language death,&#91;131&#93; and to claims of linguistic imperialism,&#91;132&#93; and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.&#91;133&#93;
Although some scholars&#91;who?&#93; mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.&#91;134&#93; English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.&#91;135&#93; Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.&#91;136&#93;&#91;137&#93;
The phonetics and phonology of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes. &#91;138&#93; This overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States: Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA). (See § ;Dialects, accents, and varieties, below.)
The phonetic symbols used below are from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).&#91;139&#93;&#91;140&#93;&#91;141&#93;
Most English dialects share the same 24 ;consonant phonemes. The consonant inventory shown below is valid for California English,&#91;142&#93; and for RP.&#91;143&#93;
* Conventionally transcribed /r/
In the table, when obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as /p b/, /tʃ dʒ/, and /s z/, the first is fortis (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as /p tʃ s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as /b dʒ z/, and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as /p/ have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [pʰ] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [p̚] or pre-glottalised [ʔp] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than nib [nɪˑb̥] (see below).&#91;144&#93; 
In RP, the lateral approximant /l/, has two main allophones (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain [l], as in light, and the dark or velarised [ɫ], as in full.&#91;145&#93; GA has dark l in most cases.&#91;146&#93;
All sonorants (liquids /l, r/ and nasals /m, n, ŋ/) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.&#91;147&#93;
The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.&#91;148&#93;
In RP, vowel length is phonemic; long vowels are marked with a triangular colon &#x27e8;ː&#x27e9; in the table above, such as the vowel of need [niːd] as opposed to bid [bɪd]. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.
In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like /t tʃ f/, but not before lenis consonants like /d dʒ v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of rich [rɪtʃ], neat [nit], and safe [seɪ̯f] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge [rɪˑdʒ], need [niˑd], and save [seˑɪ̯v], and the vowel of light [laɪ̯t] is shorter than that of lie [laˑɪ̯]. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.&#91;149&#93;
The vowel /ə/ only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.&#91;150&#93;&#91;151&#93; Some dialects do not contrast /ɪ/ and /ə/ in unstressed positions, so that rabbit and abbot rhyme and Lenin and Lennon are homophonous, a dialect feature called weak vowel merger.&#91;152&#93; GA /ɜr/ and /ər/ are realised as an r-coloured vowel [ɚ], as in further [ˈfɚðɚ] (phonemically /ˈfɜrðər/), which in RP is realised as [ˈfəːðə] (phonemically /ˈfɜːðə/).&#91;153&#93;
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint /sprɪnt/, and end with up to four, as in texts /teksts/. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word strengths /strɛŋkθs/ is thus an example of the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly; s and a voiceless stop, as in stay; and s, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in string.&#91;154&#93; Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable-initial position, and /ŋ/ only in syllable-final position.&#91;155&#93;
Stress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not.&#91;156&#93; Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.
Stress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word contract is stressed on the first syllable (/ˈkɒntrækt/ KON-trakt) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (/kənˈtrækt/ kən-TRAKT) for most meanings (for example, "reduce in size") when used as a verb.&#91;157&#93;&#91;158&#93;&#91;159&#93; Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /ɒ/, but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /ə/. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. a burnout (/ˈbɜːrnaʊt/) versus to burn out (/ˈbɜːrn ˈaʊt/), and a hotdog (/ˈhɒtdɒɡ/) versus a hot dog (/ˈhɒt ˈdɒɡ/).&#91;160&#93;
In terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.&#91;161&#93; Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.&#91;162&#93;
Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table "Varieties of Standard English and their features".&#91;163&#93;
English has undergone many historical sound changes, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.&#91;164&#93;&#91;165&#93;
Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless &#91;ʍ&#93; sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced [w] in wine, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [w], a dialect feature called wine–whine merger. The unvoiced velar fricative sound /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes loch /lɔx/ from lock /lɔk/. Accents like Cockney with "h-dropping" lack the glottal fricative /h/, and dialects with th-stopping and th-fronting like African American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives /θ, ð/, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives /f, v/.&#91;166&#93;&#91;167&#93; Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod-dropping, yod-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.&#91;168&#93;
General American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the syllable coda). GA is a rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces /r/ at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide /r/ like RP or keep it like GA.&#91;169&#93;
There is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels /æ ɑː ɒ ɔː/. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three /æ ɑ ɔ/,&#91;170&#93; and in Canadian English, they merge to two /æ ɑ/.&#91;171&#93; In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table "Dialects and open vowels" shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur.
As is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.&#91;172&#93; English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.&#91;173&#93;
Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs speak/spoke and foot/feet) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as love/loved, hand/hands).&#91;174&#93; Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (he/him, who/whom) and in the inflection of the copula verb to be.&#91;174&#93;
The seven-word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:&#91;175&#93;
English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns.&#91;176&#93;
Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.&#91;177&#93;
Regular plural formation:
Irregular plural formation:
Possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.&#91;173&#93;
Possessive constructions:
Nouns can form noun phrases (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.&#91;178&#93; Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.&#91;173&#93; For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.
The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.&#91;179&#93;
Adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.&#91;180&#93; In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.
Some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, the boy is smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy.&#91;181&#93; There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.&#91;182&#93;
English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both in the sense of the previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb).&#91;183&#93;&#91;184&#93; Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise, the objective case is used.&#91;185&#93; While grammarians such as Henry Sweet&#91;186&#93; and Otto Jespersen&#91;187&#93; noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002), retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.
Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. the chair is mine).&#91;188&#93; The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old 2nd person singular familiar pronoun thou acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned), and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse found in Australian English and ye in Irish English.
Pronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation—for example, the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence I already told you that. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. "he sent it to himself" or "she braced herself for impact").&#91;189&#93;
Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. with the dog, for my friend, to school, in England.&#91;190&#93; Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.&#91;190&#93; For example, in the phrase I gave it to him, the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb to give. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, "with her", "to me", "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as that of Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002:598–600) no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.
English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.&#91;181&#93; Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.&#91;191&#93;&#91;192&#93;
Most verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.&#91;193&#93; The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is am, the third person singular form is is, and the form are is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.
English has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed, and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.&#91;191&#93;
English does not have a morphologised future tense.&#91;194&#93; Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall.&#91;195&#93; Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to.&#91;196&#93;
Further aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily have and be, which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (I have run vs. I was running), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (I had been running) and present perfect (I have been running).&#91;197&#93;
For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).&#91;195&#93;
An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.&#91;198&#93; For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.
English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to back up, to give up, to get together, to hang out, to put up with, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment).&#91;199&#93; In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including Huddleston &amp; Pullum (2002:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term "phrasal verb". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent.
The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.&#91;173&#93; Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix -ly. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly, the adverb quickly is derived in this way from the adjective quick. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.
Modern English syntax language is moderately analytic.&#91;200&#93; It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.
English word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject–verb–object (SVO).&#91;201&#93; The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it.
In most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.&#91;202&#93; The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:
An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.&#91;203&#93; The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:
Indirect objects (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as I gave Jane the book or in a prepositional phrase, such as I gave the book to Jane.&#91;204&#93;
In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.&#91;205&#93; Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.)&#91;206&#93; In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.&#91;207&#93;
English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.
The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in "I did shut the fridge." However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *I know not—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like I do not (don't) know. The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *Know you him?; grammatical rules require Do you know him?&#91;208&#93;
Negation is done with the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not -n't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.&#91;209&#93;
Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).&#91;210&#93;
Both yes–no questions and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) appear in a fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.&#91;211&#93;
While English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee.&#91;212&#93; Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.
Focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, the girl was stung by a bee (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or The girl was stung by a bee (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).&#91;213&#93; Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an "afterthought".&#91;214&#93;
Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).&#91;215&#93; Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.&#91;216&#93;
English is a rich language in terms of vocabulary, containing more synonyms than any other language.&#91;132&#93; There are words which appear on the surface to mean exactly the same thing but which, in fact, have slightly different shades of meaning and must be chosen appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message intended. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1989.&#91;217&#93; Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 ;million words—but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms.&#91;218&#93;
Due to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly, and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora,&#91;219&#93; collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.&#91;218&#93;&#91;220&#93;
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,&#91;221&#93; using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,&#91;218&#93;&#91;220&#93; producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick.&#91;221&#93; A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (-hood, -ness, -ing, -ility) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin).
Formation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example television or optometry) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the "international scientific vocabulary" (ISV) when compiling Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms,&#91;222&#93; words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. NATO, laser).
Source languages of English vocabulary&#91;6&#93;&#91;223&#93;
English, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.&#91;224&#93; The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.&#91;225&#93; The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are mainly the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.&#91;218&#93;
But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of "Latinate" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.&#91;226&#93; Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers.&#91;227&#93; Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as egg and knife.&#91;228&#93;
English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.&#91;220&#93;&#91;218&#93; Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.&#91;229&#93; English continues to gain new loanwords and calques ("loan translations") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.&#91;230&#93;
English has formal and informal speech registers; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.&#91;231&#93;&#91;232&#93;
English has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.&#91;226&#93;&#91;233&#93; The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.&#91;234&#93; That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.&#91;235&#93; Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.&#91;236&#93; Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.&#91;236&#93;
Since the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.&#91;34&#93; The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
The spelling system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.&#91;237&#93; Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace.&#91;46&#93; Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.&#91;238&#93; There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.&#91;239&#93;
Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.&#91;240&#93; Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words photograph, photography, and photographic,&#91;240&#93; or the words electricity and electrical. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is "near-optimal",&#91;237&#93; there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.&#91;241&#93; The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.&#91;242&#93; Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.&#91;243&#93;
Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z represent, respectively, the phonemes /b, d, f, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/. The letters c and g normally represent /k/ and /ɡ/, but there is also a soft c pronounced /s/, and a soft g pronounced /dʒ/. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for /tʃ/, sh for /ʃ/, th for /θ/ or /ð/, ng for /ŋ/, qu for /kw/, and ph for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin&#91;240&#93; or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.&#91;244&#93;
For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (a, e, i, o, u, w, y). As a result, some "long vowels" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the oa in boat, the ow in how, and the ay in stay), or the historically based silent e (as in note and cake).&#91;241&#93;
The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.&#91;245&#93; Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.&#91;240&#93; Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.&#91;246&#93;&#91;247&#93; Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.&#91;248&#93;
English writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.&#91;249&#93;
Dialectologists identify many English dialects, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE).&#91;250&#93; There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.
As the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most diverse dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the Received Pronunciation (RP), an educated dialect of South East England, is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.&#91;251&#93;
Nonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact, only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.&#91;252&#93; There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.&#91;253&#93; Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered "non-standard" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is H-dropping, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England—yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.&#91;254&#93;
English in England can be divided into four major dialect regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.&#91;255&#93;
Since the 15th century, southeastern England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the south-east led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.&#91;256&#93;&#91;257&#93;&#91;258&#93; Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R (drawing is pronounced drawring /ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/), t-glottalisation (Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po'er /poʔʌ/), and the pronunciation of th- as /f/ (thanks pronounced fanks) or /v/ (bother pronounced bover).&#91;259&#93;
Scots is today considered a separate language from English, but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English&#91;260&#93; and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, Scottish English comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.&#91;261&#93;
In Ireland, various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area surrounding Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.&#91;21&#93;&#91;262&#93;
North American English is fairly homogeneous compared to British English. Today, American accent variation is often increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,&#91;263&#93; though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,&#91;264&#93; known collectively as General American (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves (such as Midland and Western American English).&#91;265&#93;&#91;266&#93;&#91;267&#93; In most American and Canadian English dialects, rhoticity (or r-fulness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (r-dropping) becoming associated with lower prestige and social class especially after World War II; this contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.&#91;268&#93;
Separate from GA are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems, historically including Southern American English, English of the coastal Northeast (famously including Eastern New England English and New York City English), and African American Vernacular English, all of which are historically non-rhotic. Canadian English, except for the Atlantic provinces and perhaps Quebec, may be classified under GA as well, but it often shows the raising of the vowels /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ before voiceless consonants, as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation standards.&#91;269&#93;
In Southern American English, the most populous American "accent group" outside of GA,&#91;270&#93; rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's historical non-rhotic prestige.&#91;271&#93;&#91;272&#93;&#91;273&#93; Southern accents are colloquially described as a "drawl" or "twang,"&#91;274&#93; being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide-deleting in the /aɪ/ vowel (e.g. pronouncing spy almost like spa), the "Southern breaking" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word "press" almost like "pray-us"),&#91;275&#93; the pin–pen merger, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.&#91;276&#93;
Today spoken primarily by working- and middle-class African Americans, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard older Southern dialects. A minority of linguists,&#91;277&#93; contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.&#91;278&#93; AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggests it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of "broken" or "uneducated" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by a large speech community.&#91;279&#93;&#91;280&#93;
Since 1788, English has been spoken in Oceania, and Australian English has developed as a first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.&#91;281&#93; Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are).&#91;282&#93;&#91;283&#93; New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.&#91;284&#93;&#91;285&#93;&#91;286&#93;
The first significant exposure of the Philippines to the English language occurred in 1762 when the British occupied Manila during the Seven Years' War, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946, and remains an official language of the Philippines. Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, from street signs and marquees, government documents and forms, courtrooms, the media and entertainment industries, the business sector, and other aspects of daily life. One such usage that is also prominent in the country is in speech, where most Filipinos from Manila would use or have been exposed to Taglish, a form of code-switching between Tagalog and English. A similar code-switching method is used by urban native speakers of Visayan languages called Bislish.
English is spoken widely in southern Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today, about 9 percent of the South African population speaks South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is alone among non-rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.&#91;287&#93; Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.&#91;288&#93; Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. pin pronounced [pɪn] rather than as [pʰɪn] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [ɾ] instead of as the more common fricative.&#91;289&#93;
Nigerian English is a dialect of English spoken in Nigeria.&#91;290&#93; It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. senior wife). Over 150 ;million Nigerians speak English.&#91;291&#93;
Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Belize. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.&#91;292&#93; Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code-switching between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as "basilect" and the more RP-like forms serving as the "acrolect", the most formal register.&#91;293&#93;
Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs [eː] and [oː] or even the reverse diphthongs [ie] and [uo] (e.g. bay and boat pronounced [bʲeː] and [bʷoːt]). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that "child" is pronounced [t͡ʃail] and "wind" [win].&#91;294&#93;&#91;295&#93;&#91;296&#93;
As a historical legacy, Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [ʈ] and [ɖ]) and the replacement of /θ/ and /ð/ with dentals [t̪] and [d̪]. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent &#x27e8;h&#x27e9; found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop [ɡʱ].&#91;297&#93;

Sega is a Japanese video game developer and publisher headquartered in Shinagawa, Tokyo. It was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart on June ;3, 1960; shortly after, the company acquired the assets of its predecessor, Service Games of Japan. Sega developed its first coin-operated game, Periscope, in the late 1960s. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega developed video game consoles, starting with the SG-1000 and Master System, but struggled against competitors such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. Sega released its next console, the Sega Genesis, in 1988; it found success outside Japan starting with Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. In 2001, Sega stopped making consoles to become a third-party developer and publisher, and was acquired by Sammy Corporation in 2004. Sega produces multi-million-selling game franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Total War, and Yakuza, and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. (Full ;article...)

Anna Palm de Rosa (1859–1924) was a Swedish artist and landscape painter. In the 1890s, she was one of Sweden's most popular painters, with her watercolours of steamers, sailing ships and scenes of Stockholm, but she left Sweden for good at the age of 36, marrying an Italian and spending the rest of her life in southern Italy.
This painting, dated 1885, shows a game of ombre at Brøndums Hotel, in Skagen in the north of Denmark. The hotel is remembered for its close associations with the late 19th-century artists' colony known as the Skagen Painters. In order to help cover their board and lodgings, some of the artists donated their work to the hotel, where the pictures were displayed on the walls of the dining room. This painting is now in the collection of Skagens Museum.
